0,"﻿ Darya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe, at her sister Kitty Levin’s.",anger
1,"The house on her own estate was quite in ruins, and Levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with them.",anger
2,Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement.,anger
3,"He said he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the summer in the country with his family, which would have been the greatest happiness for him; and remaining in Moscow, he came down to the country from time to time for a day or two.",anger
4,"Besides the Oblonskys, with all their children and their governess, the old princess too came to stay that summer with the Levins, as she considered it her duty to watch over her inexperienced daughter in her _interesting condition_.",joy
5,"Moreover, Varenka, Kitty’s friend abroad, kept her promise to come to Kitty when she was married, and stayed with her friend.",anger
6,All of these were friends or relations of Levin’s wife.,anger
7,"And though he liked them all, he rather regretted his own Levin world and ways, which was smothered by this influx of the “Shtcherbatsky element,” as he called it to himself.",anger
8,"Of his own relations there stayed with him only Sergey Ivanovitch, but he too was a man of the Koznishev and not the Levin stamp, so that the Levin spirit was utterly obliterated.",sadness
9,"In the Levins’ house, so long deserted, there were now so many people that almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it happened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all over, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate table.",sadness
10,"And Kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble to get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.",joy
11,The whole family were sitting at dinner.,anger
12,"Dolly’s children, with their governess and Varenka, were making plans for going to look for mushrooms.",joy
13,"Sergey Ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for his intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe, surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.",surprise
14,“Take me with you.,anger
15,"I am very fond of picking mushrooms,” he said, looking at Varenka; “I think it’s a very nice occupation.” “Oh, we shall be delighted,” answered Varenka, coloring a little.",joy
16,Kitty exchanged meaningful glances with Dolly.,anger
17,The proposal of the learned and intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with Varenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty’s with which her mind had been very busy of late.,anger
18,"She made haste to address some remark to her mother, so that her look should not be noticed.",anger
19,"After dinner Sergey Ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother, he watched the door through which the children would start on the mushroom-picking expedition.",anger
20,Levin was sitting in the window near his brother.,anger
21,"Kitty stood beside her husband, evidently awaiting the end of a conversation that had no interest for her, in order to tell him something.",anger
22,"“You have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for the better,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling to Kitty, and obviously little interested in the conversation, “but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical theories.” “Katya, it’s not good for you to stand,” her husband said to her, putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her.",anger
23,"“Oh, and there’s no time either,” added Sergey Ivanovitch, seeing the children running out.",anger
24,"At the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways, in her tightly-drawn stockings, and waving a basket and Sergey Ivanovitch’s hat, she ran straight up to him.",anger
25,"Boldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes, so like her father’s fine eyes, she handed him his hat and made as though she would put it on for him, softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile.",joy
26,"“Varenka’s waiting,” she said, carefully putting his hat on, seeing from Sergey Ivanovitch’s smile that she might do so.",joy
27,"Varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with a white kerchief on her head.",anger
28,"“I’m coming, I’m coming, Varvara Andreevna,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, finishing his cup of coffee, and putting into their separate pockets his handkerchief and cigar-case.",anger
29,“And how sweet my Varenka is!,joy
30,"eh?” said Kitty to her husband, as soon as Sergey Ivanovitch rose.",anger
31,"She spoke so that Sergey Ivanovitch could hear, and it was clear that she meant him to do so.",anger
32,“And how good-looking she is—such a refined beauty!,joy
33,Varenka!” Kitty shouted.,anger
34,“Shall you be in the mill copse?,anger
35,"We’ll come out to you.” “You certainly forget your condition, Kitty,” said the old princess, hurriedly coming out at the door.",anger
36,"“You mustn’t shout like that.” Varenka, hearing Kitty’s voice and her mother’s reprimand, went with light, rapid steps up to Kitty.",joy
37,"The rapidity of her movement, her flushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of the common was going on in her.",joy
38,"Kitty knew what this was, and had been watching her intently.",anger
39,"She called Varenka at that moment merely in order mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which, as Kitty fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood.",joy
40,"“Varenka, I should be very happy if a certain something were to happen,” she whispered as she kissed her.",joy
41,"“And are you coming with us?” Varenka said to Levin in confusion, pretending not to have heard what had been said.",anger
42,"“I am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there I shall stop.” “Why, what do you want there?” said Kitty.",anger
43,"“I must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice,” said Levin; “and where will you be?” “On the terrace.” On the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party.",anger
44,"They always liked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do there too.",anger
45,"Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes, with which all of them were busy, that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to Agafea Mihalovna, without the addition of water.",joy
46,"Kitty had introduced this new method, which had been in use in her home.",anger
47,"Agafea Mihalovna, to whom the task of jam-making had always been intrusted, considering that what had been done in the Levin household could not be amiss, had nevertheless put water with the strawberries, maintaining that the jam could not be made without it.",anger
48,"She had been caught in the act, and was now making jam before everyone, and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water.",joy
49,"Agafea Mihalovna, her face heated and angry, her hair untidy, and her thin arms bare to the elbows, was turning the preserving-pan over the charcoal stove, looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly.",anger
50,"The princess, conscious that Agafea Mihalovna’s wrath must be chiefly directed against her, as the person responsible for the raspberry jam-making, tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of other matters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.",anger
51,"“I always buy my maids’ dresses myself, of some cheap material,” the princess said, continuing the previous conversation.",joy
52,"“Isn’t it time to skim it, my dear?” she added, addressing Agafea Mihalovna.",anger
53,"“There’s not the slightest need for you to do it, and it’s hot for you,” she said, stopping Kitty.",anger
54,"“I’ll do it,” said Dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup.",anger
55,"“How they’ll enjoy this at tea-time!” she thought of her children, remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what was best of all—the scum of the jam.",anger
56,"“Stiva says it’s much better to give money.” Dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to servants.",anger
57,“But....” “Money’s out of the question!” the princess and Kitty exclaimed with one voice.,anger
58,"“They appreciate a present....” “Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matrona Semyenovna, not a poplin, but something of that sort,” said the princess.",joy
59,"“I remember she was wearing it on your nameday.” “A charming pattern—so simple and refined,—I should have liked it myself, if she hadn’t had it.",joy
60,Something like Varenka’s.,anger
61,"So pretty and inexpensive.” “Well, now I think it’s done,” said Dolly, dropping the syrup from the spoon.",anger
62,"“When it sets as it drops, it’s ready.",joy
63,"Cook it a little longer, Agafea Mihalovna.” “The flies!” said Agafea Mihalovna angrily.",anger
64,"“It’ll be just the same,” she added.",anger
65,“Ah!,anger
66,how sweet it is!,joy
67,"don’t frighten it!” Kitty said suddenly, looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry.",anger
68,"“Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,” said her mother.",anger
69,"“_À propos de Varenka_,” said Kitty, speaking in French, as they had been doing all the while, so that Agafea Mihalovna should not understand them, “you know, mamma, I somehow expect things to be settled today.",joy
70,You know what I mean.,anger
71,How splendid it would be!” “But what a famous matchmaker she is!” said Dolly.,joy
72,"“How carefully and cleverly she throws them together!...” “No; tell me, mamma, what do you think?” “Why, what is one to think?",joy
73,"He” (_he_ meant Sergey Ivanovitch) “might at any time have been a match for anyone in Russia; now, of course, he’s not quite a young man, still I know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now.... She’s a very nice girl, but he might....” “Oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, nothing better could be imagined.",joy
74,"In the first place, she’s charming!” said Kitty, crooking one of her fingers.",joy
75,"“He thinks her very attractive, that’s certain,” assented Dolly.",joy
76,“Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife.,sadness
77,"All he needs is a good, sweet wife—a restful one.” “Well, with her he would certainly be restful,” Dolly assented.",joy
78,"“Thirdly, that she should love him.",anger
79,"And so it is ... that is, it would be so splendid!...",joy
80,I look forward to seeing them coming out of the forest—and everything settled.,anger
81,I shall see at once by their eyes.,anger
82,I should be so delighted!,joy
83,"What do you think, Dolly?” “But don’t excite yourself.",joy
84,"It’s not at all the thing for you to be excited,” said her mother.",joy
85,"“Oh, I’m not excited, mamma.",joy
86,"I fancy he will make her an offer today.” “Ah, that’s so strange, how and when a man makes an offer!...",fear
87,"There is a sort of barrier, and all at once it’s broken down,” said Dolly, smiling pensively and recalling her past with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
88,"“Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?” Kitty asked suddenly.",anger
89,"“There was nothing out of the way, it was very simple,” answered the princess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection.",joy
90,"“Oh, but how was it?",anger
91,"You loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to speak?” Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman’s life.",joy
92,"“Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.” “But how was it settled between you, mamma?” “You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",joy
93,"It’s always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles....” “How nicely you said that, mamma!",joy
94,"It’s just by the eyes, by smiles that it’s done,” Dolly assented.",joy
95,“But what words did he say?” “What did Kostya say to you?” “He wrote it in chalk.,anger
96,It was wonderful.... How long ago it seems!” she said.,joy
97,And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing.,anger
98,Kitty was the first to break the silence.,anger
99,"She remembered all that last winter before her marriage, and her passion for Vronsky.",sadness
100,"“There’s one thing ... that old love affair of Varenka’s,” she said, a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point.",joy
101,"“I should have liked to say something to Sergey Ivanovitch, to prepare him.",anger
102,"They’re all—all men, I mean,” she added, “awfully jealous over our past.” “Not all,” said Dolly.",anger
103,“You judge by your own husband.,anger
104,It makes him miserable even now to remember Vronsky.,sadness
105,Eh?,joy
106,"that’s true, isn’t it?” “Yes,” Kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.",joy
107,"“But I really don’t know,” the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter, “what there was in your past that could worry him?",anger
108,"That Vronsky paid you attentions—that happens to every girl.” “Oh, yes, but we didn’t mean that,” Kitty said, flushing a little.",anger
109,"“No, let me speak,” her mother went on, “why, you yourself would not let me have a talk to Vronsky.",anger
110,"Don’t you remember?” “Oh, mamma!” said Kitty, with an expression of suffering.",sadness
111,“There’s no keeping you young people in check nowadays....,anger
112,Your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable.,anger
113,I should myself have called upon him to explain himself.,anger
114,"But, my darling, it’s not right for you to be agitated.",anger
115,"Please remember that, and calm yourself.” “I’m perfectly calm, maman.” “How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then,” said Dolly, “and how unhappy for her.",joy
116,"It turned out quite the opposite,” she said, struck by her own ideas.",anger
117,"“Then Anna was so happy, and Kitty thought herself unhappy.",sadness
118,Now it is just the opposite.,anger
119,I often think of her.” “A nice person to think about!,joy
120,"Horrid, repulsive woman—no heart,” said her mother, who could not forget that Kitty had married not Vronsky, but Levin.",anger
121,“What do you want to talk of it for?” Kitty said with annoyance.,anger
122,"“I never think about it, and I don’t want to think of it.... And I don’t want to think of it,” she said, catching the sound of her husband’s well-known step on the steps of the terrace.",joy
123,"“What’s that you don’t want to think about?” inquired Levin, coming onto the terrace.",anger
124,"But no one answered him, and he did not repeat the question.",anger
125,"“I’m sorry I’ve broken in on your feminine parliament,” he said, looking round on everyone discontentedly, and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him.",anger
126,"For a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agafea Mihalovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and altogether at the outside Shtcherbatsky element.",joy
127,"He smiled, however, and went up to Kitty.",anger
128,"“Well, how are you?” he asked her, looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now.",anger
129,"“Oh, very well,” said Kitty, smiling, “and how have things gone with you?” “The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did.",joy
130,"Well, are we going for the children?",joy
131,I’ve ordered the horses to be put in.” “What!,anger
132,you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?” her mother said reproachfully.,anger
133,"“Yes, at a walking pace, princess.” Levin never called the princess “maman” as men often do call their mothers-in-law, and the princess disliked his not doing so.",anger
134,"But though he liked and respected the princess, Levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.",sadness
135,"“Come with us, maman,” said Kitty.",anger
136,"“I don’t like to see such imprudence.” “Well, I’ll walk then, I’m so well.” Kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand.",anger
137,"“You may be well, but everything in moderation,” said the princess.",joy
138,"“Well, Agafea Mihalovna, is the jam done?” said Levin, smiling to Agafea Mihalovna, and trying to cheer her up.",anger
139,“Is it all right in the new way?” “I suppose it’s all right.,joy
140,"For our notions it’s boiled too long.” “It’ll be all the better, Agafea Mihalovna, it won’t mildew, even though our ice has begun to thaw already, so that we’ve no cool cellar to store it,” said Kitty, at once divining her husband’s motive, and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling; “but your pickle’s so good, that mamma says she never tasted any like it,” she added, smiling, and putting her kerchief straight.",joy
141,Agafea Mihalovna looked angrily at Kitty.,anger
142,"“You needn’t try to console me, mistress.",anger
143,"I need only to look at you with him, and I feel happy,” she said, and something in the rough familiarity of that _with him_ touched Kitty.",joy
144,"“Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the best places.” Agafea Mihalovna smiled and shook her head, as though to say: “I should like to be angry with you too, but I can’t.” “Do it, please, by my receipt,” said the princess; “put some paper over the jam, and moisten it with a little rum, and without even ice, it will never go mildewy.” Kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband, for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face—always so quick to reflect every feeling—at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of, and had got no answer.",anger
145,"When they had set off on foot ahead of the others, and had come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road, marked with rusty wheels and sprinkled with grains of corn, she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her.",anger
146,"He had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression, and alone with her he felt, now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind, a new and delicious bliss, quite pure from all alloy of sense, in the being near to the woman he loved.",joy
147,"There was no need of speech, yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice, which like her eyes had changed since she had been with child.",sadness
148,"In her voice, as in her eyes, there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit.",joy
149,“So you’re not tired?,sadness
150,"Lean more on me,” said he.",anger
151,"“No, I’m so glad of a chance of being alone with you, and I must own, though I’m happy with them, I do regret our winter evenings alone.” “That was good, but this is even better.",joy
152,"Both are better,” he said, squeezing her hand.",anger
153,"“Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?” “About jam?” “Oh, yes, about jam too; but afterwards, about how men make offers.” “Ah!” said Levin, listening more to the sound of her voice than to the words she was saying, and all the while paying attention to the road, which passed now through the forest, and avoiding places where she might make a false step.",sadness
154,“And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka.,anger
155,You’ve noticed?...,anger
156,"I’m very anxious for it,” she went on.",fear
157,“What do you think about it?” And she peeped into his face.,anger
158,"“I don’t know what to think,” Levin answered, smiling.",joy
159,“Sergey seems very strange to me in that way.,fear
160,"I told you, you know....” “Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died....” “That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and tradition.",joy
161,I remember him then.,anger
162,He was wonderfully sweet.,joy
163,"But I’ve watched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes, but one feels that to him they’re simply people, not women.” “Yes, but now with Varenka ...",joy
164,I fancy there’s something....” “Perhaps there is....,joy
165,"But one has to know him.... He’s a peculiar, wonderful person.",joy
166,He lives a spiritual life only.,joy
167,"He’s too pure, too exalted a nature.” “Why?",joy
168,"Would this lower him, then?” “No, but he’s so used to a spiritual life that he can’t reconcile himself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all fact.” Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language.",anger
169,"He knew that his wife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand what he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.",love
170,"“Yes, but there’s not so much of that actual fact about her as about me.",anger
171,I can see that he would never have cared for me.,anger
172,"She is altogether spiritual.” “Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my people like you....” “Yes, he’s very nice to me; but....” “It’s not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared for each other,” Levin finished.",joy
173,“Why not speak of him?” he added.,anger
174,“I sometimes blame myself for not; it ends in one’s forgetting.,anger
175,"Ah, how terrible and dear he was!...",anger
176,"Yes, what were we talking about?” Levin said, after a pause.",joy
177,"“You think he can’t fall in love,” said Kitty, translating into her own language.",joy
178,"“It’s not so much that he can’t fall in love,” Levin said, smiling, “but he has not the weakness necessary.... I’ve always envied him, and even now, when I’m so happy, I still envy him.” “You envy him for not being able to fall in love?” “I envy him for being better than I,” said Levin.",joy
179,“He does not live for himself.,joy
180,His whole life is subordinated to his duty.,anger
181,"And that’s why he can be calm and contented.” “And you?” Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.",joy
182,"She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile; but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his brother and abasing himself, was not quite sincere.",joy
183,"Kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of shame at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to be better—she loved it in him, and so she smiled.",joy
184,“And you?,anger
185,"What are you dissatisfied with?” she asked, with the same smile.",anger
186,"Her disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him, and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief.",joy
187,"“I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself....” he said.",anger
188,"“Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?” “Well, how shall I say?...",joy
189,In my heart I really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble—see?,joy
190,"Oh, but really you mustn’t skip about like that!” he cried, breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path.",sadness
191,"“But when I think about myself, and compare myself with others, especially with my brother, I feel I’m a poor creature.” “But in what way?” Kitty pursued with the same smile.",sadness
192,“Don’t you too work for others?,anger
193,"What about your co-operative settlement, and your work on the estate, and your book?...” “Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now—it’s your fault,” he said, pressing her hand—“that all that doesn’t count.",joy
194,I do it in a way halfheartedly.,anger
195,If I could care for all that as I care for you!...,anger
196,"Instead of that, I do it in these days like a task that is set me.” “Well, what would you say about papa?” asked Kitty.",anger
197,"“Is he a poor creature then, as he does nothing for the public good?” “He?—no!",joy
198,"But then one must have the simplicity, the straightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven’t got that.",anger
199,"I do nothing, and I fret about it.",anger
200,It’s all your doing.,joy
201,"Before there was you—and _this_ too,” he added with a glance towards her waist that she understood—“I put all my energies into work; now I can’t, and I’m ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me, I’m pretending....” “Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey Ivanovitch?” said Kitty.",sadness
202,"“Would you like to do this work for the general good, and to love the task set you, as he does, and nothing else?” “Of course not,” said Levin.",joy
203,“But I’m so happy that I don’t understand anything.,joy
204,So you think he’ll make her an offer today?” he added after a brief silence.,sadness
205,"“I think so, and I don’t think so.",joy
206,"Only, I’m awfully anxious for it.",fear
207,"Here, wait a minute.” She stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path.",anger
208,"“Come, count: he does propose, he doesn’t,” she said, giving him the flower.",anger
209,"“He does, he doesn’t,” said Levin, tearing off the white petals.",anger
210,"“No, no!” Kitty, snatching at his hand, stopped him.",anger
211,She had been watching his fingers with interest.,anger
212,"“You picked off two.” “Oh, but see, this little one shan’t count to make up,” said Levin, tearing off a little half-grown petal.",anger
213,"“Here’s the wagonette overtaking us.” “Aren’t you tired, Kitty?” called the princess.",anger
214,"“Not in the least.” “If you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking.” But it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place, and all walked on together.",anger
215,"Varenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for, was very attractive.",joy
216,"Sergey Ivanovitch walked beside her, and never left off admiring her.",anger
217,"Looking at her, he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the good he knew about her, and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long, long ago, and only once, in his early youth.",joy
218,"The feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he put a huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her basket, he looked straight into her face, and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face, he was confused himself, and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much.",fear
219,"“If so,” he said to himself, “I ought to think it over and make up my mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.” “I’m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my efforts will make no show,” he said, and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel.",joy
220,"Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch, knowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins.",joy
221,It was perfectly still all round him.,joy
222,"Only overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like a swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the children’s voices were floated across to him.",anger
223,"All at once he heard, not far from the edge of the wood, the sound of Varenka’s contralto voice, calling Grisha, and a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch’s face.",joy
224,"Conscious of this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition, and taking out a cigar, he began lighting it.",joy
225,For a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree.,anger
226,"The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and the light went out.",anger
227,"At last one of the matches burned, and the fragrant cigar smoke, hovering uncertainly in flat, wide coils, stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree.",fear
228,"Watching the streak of smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked gently on, deliberating on his position.",anger
229,“Why not?” he thought.,anger
230,"“If it were only a passing fancy or a passion, if it were only this attraction—this mutual attraction (I can call it a _mutual_ attraction), but if I felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life—if I felt that in giving way to this attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it’s not so.",sadness
231,"The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie, I said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory.",sadness
232,"That’s the only thing I can say against my feeling.... That’s a great thing,” Sergey Ivanovitch said to himself, feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally, but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others.",joy
233,"“But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never find anything to say against my feeling.",sadness
234,"If I were choosing by considerations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything better.” However many women and girls he thought of whom he knew, he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all, positively all, the qualities he would wish to see in his wife.",sadness
235,"She had all the charm and freshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.",joy
236,"Another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she knew the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch’s conception of the woman who was to share his life.",joy
237,"Thirdly: she was religious, and not like a child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for example, was, but her life was founded on religious principles.",joy
238,"Even in trifling matters, Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife: she was poor and alone in the world, so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband’s house, as he saw now in Kitty’s case.",sadness
239,"She would owe everything to her husband, which was what he had always desired too for his future family life.",joy
240,"And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him.",love
241,"He was a modest man, but he could not help seeing it.",joy
242,And he loved her.,love
243,There was one consideration against it—his age.,anger
244,"But he came of a long-lived family, he had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for forty, and he remembered Varenka’s saying that it was only in Russia that men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a man of fifty considers himself _dans la force de l’âge_, while a man of forty is _un jeune homme_.",joy
245,But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?,joy
246,"Was it not youth to feel as he felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance?",joy
247,His heart throbbed joyously.,anger
248,A softened feeling came over him.,joy
249,He felt that he had made up his mind.,sadness
250,"Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked round.",anger
251,"Flinging away the cigar, Sergey Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her.",anger
252,"“Varvara Andreevna, when I was very young, I set before myself the ideal of the woman I loved and should be happy to call my wife.",joy
253,"I have lived through a long life, and now for the first time I have met what I sought—in you.",anger
254,"I love you, and offer you my hand.” Sergey Ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from Varvara.",anger
255,"Kneeling down, with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from Grisha, she was calling little Masha.",anger
256,"“Come here, little ones!",joy
257,"There are so many!” she was saying in her sweet, deep voice.",joy
258,"Seeing Sergey Ivanovitch approaching, she did not get up and did not change her position, but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it.",joy
259,"“Well, did you find some?” she asked from under the white kerchief, turning her handsome, gently smiling face to him.",joy
260,"“Not one,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
261,"“Did you?” She did not answer, busy with the children who thronged about her.",anger
262,"“That one too, near the twig,” she pointed out to little Masha a little fungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself.",anger
263,"Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus, breaking it into two white halves.",anger
264,"“This brings back my childhood,” she added, moving apart from the children beside Sergey Ivanovitch.",sadness
265,They walked on for some steps in silence.,anger
266,"Varenka saw that he wanted to speak; she guessed of what, and felt faint with joy and panic.",fear
267,"They had walked so far away that no one could hear them now, but still he did not begin to speak.",anger
268,It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.,sadness
269,After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms.,anger
270,"But against her own will, as it were accidentally, Varenka said: “So you found nothing?",anger
271,"In the middle of the wood there are always fewer, though.” Sergey Ivanovitch sighed and made no answer.",anger
272,He was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms.,anger
273,"He wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood; but after a pause of some length, as though against his own will, he made an observation in response to her last words.",anger
274,"“I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood, though I can’t tell them apart.” Some minutes more passed, they moved still further away from the children, and were quite alone.",anger
275,"Varenka’s heart throbbed so that she heard it beating, and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again.",fear
276,"To be the wife of a man like Koznishev, after her position with Madame Stahl, was to her imagination the height of happiness.",joy
277,"Besides, she was almost certain that she was in love with him.",anger
278,And this moment it would have to be decided.,anger
279,She felt frightened.,fear
280,She dreaded both his speaking and his not speaking.,anger
281,Now or never it must be said—that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.,sadness
282,"Everything in the expression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of Varenka betrayed a painful suspense.",sadness
283,Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and felt sorry for her.,sadness
284,He felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her.,sadness
285,Rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his decision.,anger
286,"He even said over to himself the words in which he meant to put his offer, but instead of those words, some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask: “What is the difference between the ‘birch’ mushroom and the ‘white’ mushroom?” Varenka’s lips quivered with emotion as she answered: “In the top part there is scarcely any difference, it’s in the stalk.” And as soon as these words were uttered, both he and she felt that it was over, that what was to have been said would not be said; and their emotion, which had up to then been continually growing more intense, began to subside.",joy
287,"“The birch mushroom’s stalk suggests a dark man’s chin after two days without shaving,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, speaking quite calmly now.",anger
288,"“Yes, that’s true,” answered Varenka smiling, and unconsciously the direction of their walk changed.",anger
289,They began to turn towards the children.,anger
290,Varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same time she had a sense of relief.,sadness
291,"When he had got home again and went over the whole subject, Sergey Ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one.",anger
292,He could not be false to the memory of Marie.,anger
293,"“Gently, children, gently!” Levin shouted quite angrily to the children, standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them.",anger
294,Behind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the wood.,anger
295,Kitty had no need to ask Varenka; she saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.,anger
296,“Well?” her husband questioned her as they were going home again.,anger
297,"“It doesn’t bite,” said Kitty, her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father, a likeness Levin often noticed with pleasure.",joy
298,"“How doesn’t bite?” “I’ll show you,” she said, taking her husband’s hand, lifting it to her mouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed lips.",anger
299,"“Like a kiss on a priest’s hand.” “Which didn’t it bite with?” he said, laughing.",anger
300,“Both.,anger
301,"But it should have been like this....” “There are some peasants coming....” “Oh, they didn’t see.” During the time of the children’s tea the grown-up people sat in the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all, especially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka, were very well aware that there had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great importance.",joy
302,"They both had the same feeling, rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination, which has left him in the same class or shut him out of the school forever.",sadness
303,"Everyone present, feeling too that something had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects.",joy
304,Levin and Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening.,joy
305,And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and could not—and they felt a prick of conscience.,anger
306,"“Mark my words, Alexander will not come,” said the old princess.",anger
307,"That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by train, and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too.",anger
308,"“And I know why,” the princess went on; “he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first.” “But papa has left us alone.",sadness
309,"We’ve never seen him,” said Kitty.",anger
310,"“Besides, we’re not young people!—we’re old, married people by now.” “Only if he doesn’t come, I shall say good-bye to you children,” said the princess, sighing mournfully.",joy
311,"“What nonsense, mamma!” both the daughters fell upon her at once.",anger
312,“How do you suppose he is feeling?,sadness
313,"Why, now....” And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess’s voice.",fear
314,"Her daughters were silent, and looked at one another.",anger
315,"“Maman always finds something to be miserable about,” they said in that glance.",anger
316,"They did not know that happy as the princess was in her daughter’s house, and useful as she felt herself to be there, she had been extremely miserable, both on her own account and her husband’s, ever since they had married their last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been left empty.",sadness
317,"“What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?” Kitty asked suddenly of Agafea Mihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of meaning.",fear
318,"“About supper.” “Well, that’s right,” said Dolly; “you go and arrange about it, and I’ll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing done all day.” “That’s my lesson!",joy
319,"No, Dolly, I’m going,” said Levin, jumping up.",anger
320,"Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays.",joy
321,"Darya Alexandrovna, who had been studying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on coming to the Levins’ to go over with him, at least once a day, the most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic.",anger
322,"Levin had offered to take her place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin’s lesson, and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had given it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again herself.",joy
323,"Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his duty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly.",surprise
324,But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as she wished.,anger
325,"And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own way, but by the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour of the lesson.",anger
326,So it had been today.,anger
327,"“No, I’m going, Dolly, you sit still,” he said.",anger
328,"“We’ll do it all properly, like the book.",anger
329,"Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting, then we shall have to miss it.” And Levin went to Grisha.",anger
330,Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty.,anger
331,"Even in the happy, well-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making herself useful.",joy
332,"“I’ll see to the supper, you sit still,” she said, and got up to go to Agafea Mihalovna.",anger
333,"“Yes, yes, most likely they’ve not been able to get chickens.",anger
334,"If so, ours....” “Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it,” and Varenka vanished with her.",anger
335,“What a nice girl!” said the princess.,joy
336,"“Not nice, maman; she’s an exquisite girl; there’s no one else like her.” “So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?” said Sergey Ivanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about Varenka.",joy
337,"“It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike than yours,” he said with a subtle smile.",joy
338,"“One all movement, only living in society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostya, lively, alert, quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either sinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land.” “Yes, he’s very heedless,” said the princess, addressing Sergey Ivanovitch.",sadness
339,"“I’ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that it’s out of the question for her” (she indicated Kitty) “to stay here; that she positively must come to Moscow.",anger
340,"He talks of getting a doctor down....” “Maman, he’ll do everything; he has agreed to everything,” Kitty said, angry with her mother for appealing to Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in such a matter.",anger
341,In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel.,anger
342,"Dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where Grisha was having his lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out after him.",anger
343,“It’s Stiva!” Levin shouted from under the balcony.,anger
344,"“We’ve finished, Dolly, don’t be afraid!” he added, and started running like a boy to meet the carriage.",anger
345,"“_Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_” shouted Grisha, skipping along the avenue.",anger
346,“And someone else too!,anger
347,"Papa, of course!” cried Levin, stopping at the entrance of the avenue.",anger
348,"“Kitty, don’t come down the steep staircase, go round.” But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince.",anger
349,"As he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young man in a Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind.",joy
350,"This was Vassenka Veslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young gentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society.",joy
351,"“A capital fellow, and a keen sportsman,” as Stepan Arkadyevitch said, introducing him.",joy
352,"Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming acquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the carriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had brought with him.",sadness
353,"Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind.",anger
354,"He was rather vexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more the more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this Vassenka Veslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person.",anger
355,"He seemed to him still more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps where the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in much excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm and gallant air, kissing Kitty’s hand.",love
356,"“Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,” said Vassenka Veslovsky, once more shaking Levin’s hand with great warmth.",joy
357,"“Well, are there plenty of birds?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Levin, hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings.",joy
358,“We’ve come with the most savage intentions.,anger
359,"Why, maman, they’ve not been in Moscow since!",anger
360,"Look, Tanya, here’s something for you!",anger
361,"Get it, please, it’s in the carriage, behind!” he talked in all directions.",anger
362,"“How pretty you’ve grown, Dolly,” he said to his wife, once more kissing her hand, holding it in one of his, and patting it with the other.",anger
363,"Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.",joy
364,"“Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?” he thought, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch’s tender demonstrations to his wife.",anger
365,"He looked at Dolly, and he did not like her either.",anger
366,“She doesn’t believe in his love.,sadness
367,So what is she so pleased about?,joy
368,Revolting!” thought Levin.,anger
369,"He looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before, and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka, with his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.",joy
370,"Even Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan Arkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor respected Oblonsky.",anger
371,"And Varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_ making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was thinking of nothing but getting married.",anger
372,"And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else.",anger
373,"And, above all, unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his smile.",anger
374,"Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were all seated, Levin turned and went out.",anger
375,Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband.,anger
376,"She tried to seize a moment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from her, saying he was wanted at the counting-house.",anger
377,It was long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.,joy
378,"“It’s all holiday for them,” he thought; “but these are no holiday matters, they won’t wait, and there’s no living without them.” Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to supper.",anger
379,"On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna, consulting about wines for supper.",joy
380,“But why are you making all this fuss?,anger
381,"Have what we usually do.” “No, Stiva doesn’t drink ... Kostya, stop, what’s the matter?” Kitty began, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining-room without waiting for her, and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
382,"“Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
383,"“Please, do let’s go,” said Veslovsky, moving to another chair, where he sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him.",anger
384,"“I shall be delighted, we will go.",joy
385,"And have you had any shooting yet this year?” said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him, and that was so out of keeping with him.",anger
386,"“I can’t answer for our finding grouse, but there are plenty of snipe.",joy
387,Only we ought to start early.,anger
388,You’re not tired?,sadness
389,"Aren’t you tired, Stiva?” “Me tired?",sadness
390,I’ve never been tired yet.,anger
391,Suppose we stay up all night.,anger
392,"Let’s go for a walk!” “Yes, really, let’s not go to bed at all!",anger
393,Capital!” Veslovsky chimed in.,anger
394,"“Oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up too,” Dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband.",sadness
395,"“But to my thinking, it’s time for bed now.... I’m going, I don’t want supper.” “No, do stay a little, Dolly,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper.",anger
396,"“I’ve so much still to tell you.” “Nothing really, I suppose.” “Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna’s, and he’s going to them again?",anger
397,"You know they’re hardly fifty miles from you, and I too must certainly go over there.",anger
398,"Veslovsky, come here!” Vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside Kitty.",anger
399,"“Ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her?",anger
400,How was she?” Darya Alexandrovna appealed to him.,anger
401,"Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and Varenka, he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan Arkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky.",joy
402,And that was not all.,joy
403,"He saw on his wife’s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was telling them something with great animation.",joy
404,"“It’s exceedingly nice at their place,” Veslovsky was telling them about Vronsky and Anna.",joy
405,"“I can’t, of course, take it upon myself to judge, but in their house you feel the real feeling of home.” “What do they intend doing?” “I believe they think of going to Moscow.” “How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together!",joy
406,When are you going there?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Vassenka.,anger
407,“I’m spending July there.” “Will you go?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife.,anger
408,"“I’ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go,” said Dolly.",anger
409,"“I am sorry for her, and I know her.",anger
410,She’s a splendid woman.,joy
411,"I will go alone, when you go back, and then I shall be in no one’s way.",anger
412,"And it will be better indeed without you.” “To be sure,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
413,"“And you, Kitty?” “I?",anger
414,"Why should I go?” Kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced round at her husband.",anger
415,"“Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?” Veslovsky asked her.",anger
416,"“She’s a very fascinating woman.” “Yes,” she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more.",joy
417,She got up and walked across to her husband.,anger
418,"“Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?” she said.",joy
419,"His jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, gone far indeed.",sadness
420,"Now as he heard her words, he construed them in his own fashion.",joy
421,"Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to Vassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.",anger
422,"“Yes, I’m going,” he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable to himself.",anger
423,"“No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won’t see anything of her husband, and set off the day after,” said Kitty.",anger
424,The motive of Kitty’s words was interpreted by Levin thus: “Don’t separate me from _him_.,anger
425,"I don’t care about _your_ going, but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man.” “Oh, if you wish, we’ll stay here tomorrow,” Levin answered, with peculiar amiability.",joy
426,"Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.",anger
427,Levin saw that look.,anger
428,"He turned white, and for a minute he could hardly breathe.",anger
429,“How dare he look at my wife like that!” was the feeling that boiled within him.,joy
430,"“Tomorrow, then?",anger
431,"Do, please, let us go,” said Vassenka, sitting down on a chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.",sadness
432,Levin’s jealousy went further still.,anger
433,"Already he saw himself a deceived husband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life....",joy
434,"But in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about his shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go shooting next day.",joy
435,"Happily for Levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising Kitty to go to bed.",anger
436,But even at this point Levin could not escape another agony.,sadness
437,"As he said good-night to his hostess, Vassenka would again have kissed her hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew back her hand and said with a naïve bluntness, for which the old princess scolded her afterwards: “We don’t like that fashion.” In Levin’s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them.",sadness
438,"“Why, how can one want to go to bed!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most charming and sentimental humor.",joy
439,"“Look, Kitty,” he said, pointing to the moon, which had just risen behind the lime trees—“how exquisite!",anger
440,"Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade.",anger
441,"You know, he has a splendid voice; we practiced songs together along the road.",joy
442,"He has brought some lovely songs with him, two new ones.",joy
443,"Varvara Andreevna and he must sing some duets.” When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs.",joy
444,"Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wife’s bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong.",anger
445,"But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question: “Was there perhaps something you disliked about Veslovsky?”—it all burst out, and he told her all.",fear
446,"He was humiliated himself at what he was saying, and that exasperated him all the more.",anger
447,"He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest, as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in.",anger
448,"The expression of his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her.",anger
449,"His jaws were twitching, and his voice kept breaking.",anger
450,"“You must understand that I’m not jealous, that’s a nasty word.",anger
451,"I can’t be jealous, and believe that....",anger
452,"I can’t say what I feel, but this is awful.... I’m not jealous, but I’m wounded, humiliated that anybody dare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.” “Eyes like what?” said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them.",sadness
453,"At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other end of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so increase his suffering.",sadness
454,"“And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...” “Ah!” he cried, clutching at his head, “you shouldn’t say that!...",joy
455,"If you had been attractive then....” “Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!” she said, looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration.",anger
456,"“Why, what can you be thinking about!",joy
457,"When for me there’s no one in the world, no one, no one!...",anger
458,"Would you like me never to see anyone?” For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; she was angry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, should be forbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed, not merely such trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, to save him from the agony he was suffering.",anger
459,"“You must understand the horror and comedy of my position,” he went on in a desperate whisper; “that he’s in my house, that he’s done nothing improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits on his legs.",joy
460,"He thinks it’s the best possible form, and so I’m obliged to be civil to him.” “But, Kostya, you’re exaggerating,” said Kitty, at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown now in his jealousy.",anger
461,"“The most awful part of it all is that you’re just as you always are, and especially now when to me you’re something sacred, and we’re so happy, so particularly happy—and all of a sudden a little wretch.... He’s not a little wretch; why should I abuse him?",anger
462,I have nothing to do with him.,anger
463,"But why should my, and your, happiness....” “Do you know, I understand now what it’s all come from,” Kitty was beginning.",anger
464,"“Well, what?",anger
465,"what?” “I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.” “Well, well!” Levin said in dismay.",anger
466,She told him what they had been talking about.,anger
467,"And as she told him, she was breathless with emotion.",sadness
468,"Levin was silent for a space, then he scanned her pale and distressed face, and suddenly he clutched at his head.",fear
469,"“Katya, I’ve been worrying you!",anger
470,"Darling, forgive me!",anger
471,It’s madness!,anger
472,"Katya, I’m a criminal.",anger
473,"And how could you be so distressed at such idiocy?” “Oh, I was sorry for you.” “For me?",fear
474,for me?,anger
475,How mad I am!...,anger
476,But why make you miserable?,sadness
477,"It’s awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.” “It’s humiliating too, of course.” “Oh, then I’ll keep him here all the summer, and will overwhelm him with civility,” said Levin, kissing her hands.",sadness
478,“You shall see.,anger
479,"Tomorrow.... Oh, yes, we are going tomorrow.” Next day, before the ladies were up, the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party were at the door, and Laska, aware since early morning that they were going shooting, after much whining and darting to and fro, had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman, and, disapproving of the delay, was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not come out.",sadness
480,"The first to come out was Vassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his thick thighs, in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather cartridge-belt, and in his Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new English gun without a sling.",joy
481,"Laska flew up to him, welcomed him, and jumping up, asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon, but getting no answer from him, she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again, her head on one side, and one ear pricked up to listen.",anger
482,"At last the door opened with a creak, and Stepan Arkadyevitch’s spot-and-tan pointer Krak flew out, running round and round and turning over in the air.",anger
483,Stepan Arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth.,anger
484,"“Good dog, good dog, Krak!” he cried encouragingly to the dog, who put his paws up on his chest, catching at his game bag.",joy
485,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats, in torn trousers and a short coat.",anger
486,"On his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form, but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem, and his game bag and cartridge belt, though worn, were of the very best quality.",joy
487,"Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly _chic_ for a sportsman to be in tatters, but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality.",joy
488,"He saw it now as he looked at Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant in his rags, graceful, well-fed, and joyous, a typical Russian nobleman.",joy
489,And he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same get-up.,anger
490,"“Well, and what about our host?” he asked.",anger
491,"“A young wife,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",joy
492,"“Yes, and such a charming one!” “He came down dressed.",joy
493,No doubt he’s run up to her again.” Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right.,anger
494,"Levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday, and, moreover, to beg her for Christ’s sake to be more careful.",joy
495,The great thing was for her to keep away from the children—they might any minute push against her.,anger
496,"Then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to write him, if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was well with her.",anger
497,"Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of days from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big and strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him cheerfully.",sadness
498,"“Pardon, gentlemen!” he said, running out onto the steps.",anger
499,“Have you put the lunch in?,anger
500,Why is the chestnut on the right?,anger
501,"Well, it doesn’t matter.",joy
502,"Laska, down; go and lie down!” “Put it with the herd of oxen,” he said to the herdsman, who was waiting for him at the steps with some question.",anger
503,"“Excuse me, here comes another villain.” Levin jumped out of the wagonette, in which he had already taken his seat, to meet the carpenter, who came towards the steps with a rule in his hand.",anger
504,"“You didn’t come to the counting house yesterday, and now you’re detaining me.",anger
505,"Well, what is it?” “Would your honor let me make another turning?",anger
506,It’s only three steps to add.,anger
507,And we make it just fit at the same time.,joy
508,"It will be much more convenient.” “You should have listened to me,” Levin answered with annoyance.",joy
509,“I said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps.,anger
510,Now there’s no setting it right.,joy
511,"Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.” The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place.",sadness
512,"Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to add three steps.",anger
513,"“It will be much better.” “But where’s your staircase coming out with its three steps?” “Why, upon my word, sir,” the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile.",joy
514,“It comes out right at the very spot.,joy
515,"It starts, so to speak,” he said, with a persuasive gesture; “it comes down, and comes down, and comes out.” “But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to come out?” “Why, to be sure, it’ll start from the bottom and go up and go up, and come out so,” the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly.",joy
516,“It’ll reach the ceiling and the wall.” “Upon my word!,anger
517,"Why, it’ll go up, and up, and come out like this.” Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust.",anger
518,"“There, do you see?” “As your honor likes,” said the carpenter, with a sudden gleam in his eyes, obviously understanding the thing at last.",anger
519,"“It seems it’ll be best to make a new one.” “Well, then, do it as you’re told,” Levin shouted, seating himself in the wagonette.",anger
520,“Down!,anger
521,"Hold the dogs, Philip!” Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed to talk.",joy
522,"Besides that, he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action.",joy
523,"If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh, whether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak, and whether he would shoot well that day himself.",joy
524,Not to disgrace himself before a new spectator—not to be outdone by Oblonsky—that too was a thought that crossed his brain.,anger
525,"Oblonsky was feeling the same, and he too was not talkative.",joy
526,Vassenka Veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter.,joy
527,"As he listened to him now, Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before.",sadness
528,"Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple, good-hearted, and very good-humored.",joy
529,"If Levin had met him before he was married, he would have made friends with him.",anger
530,Levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance.,anger
531,"It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed, because he had long nails and a stylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding.",joy
532,"Levin liked him for his good education, for speaking French and English with such an excellent accent, and for being a man of his world.",joy
533,"Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the Don Steppes.",joy
534,He kept praising him enthusiastically.,anger
535,“How fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse!,joy
536,Eh?,joy
537,isn’t it?” he said.,anger
538,"He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic, and it turned out nothing of the sort.",anger
539,"But his simplicity, particularly in conjunction with his good looks, his amiable smile, and the grace of his movements, was very attractive.",joy
540,"Either because his nature was sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him, anyway he liked his society.",anger
541,"After they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table.",sadness
542,"In the pocketbook there were thirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty.",fear
543,"“Do you know what, Levin, I’ll gallop home on that left trace-horse.",anger
544,That will be splendid.,joy
545,"Eh?” he said, preparing to get out.",anger
546,"“No, why should you?” answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone.",anger
547,"“I’ll send the coachman.” The coachman rode back on the trace-horse, and Levin himself drove the remaining pair.",anger
548,"“Well, now what’s our plan of campaign?",joy
549,"Tell us all about it,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
550,“Our plan is this.,joy
551,Now we’re driving to Gvozdyov.,anger
552,"In Gvozdyov there’s a grouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too.",joy
553,"It’s hot now, and we’ll get there—it’s fifteen miles or so—towards evening and have some evening shooting; we’ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors.” “And is there nothing on the way?” “Yes; but we’ll reserve ourselves; besides it’s hot.",anger
554,"There are two nice little places, but I doubt there being anything to shoot.” Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places, but they were near home; he could shoot them over any time, and they were only little places—there would hardly be room for three to shoot.",joy
555,"And so, with some insincerity, he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot.",anger
556,"When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by, but Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at once detected reeds visible from the road.",anger
557,"“Shan’t we try that?” he said, pointing to the little marsh.",anger
558,"“Levin, do, please!",joy
559,"how delightful!” Vassenka Veslovsky began begging, and Levin could but consent.",joy
560,"Before they had time to stop, the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh.",anger
561,“Krak!,anger
562,Laska!...” The dogs came back.,anger
563,“There won’t be room for three.,anger
564,"I’ll stay here,” said Levin, hoping they would find nothing but peewits, who had been startled by the dogs, and turning over in their flight, were plaintively wailing over the marsh.",fear
565,“No!,anger
566,"Come along, Levin, let’s go together!” Veslovsky called.",anger
567,"“Really, there’s not room.",anger
568,"Laska, back, Laska!",anger
569,"You won’t want another dog, will you?” Levin remained with the wagonette, and looked enviously at the sportsmen.",anger
570,They walked right across the marsh.,anger
571,"Except little birds and peewits, of which Vassenka killed one, there was nothing in the marsh.",anger
572,"“Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh,” said Levin, “only it’s wasting time.” “Oh, no, it was jolly all the same.",joy
573,"Did you see us?” said Vassenka Veslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hands.",anger
574,“How splendidly I shot this bird!,joy
575,Didn’t I?,anger
576,"Well, shall we soon be getting to the real place?” The horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his head against the stock of someone’s gun, and there was the report of a shot.",anger
577,"The gun did actually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin.",anger
578,"It appeared that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the other hammer still cocked.",anger
579,The charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone.,anger
580,Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed reprovingly at Veslovsky.,anger
581,But Levin had not the heart to reprove him.,anger
582,"In the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin’s forehead.",anger
583,"And besides, Veslovsky was at first so naïvely distressed, and then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay, that one could not but laugh with him.",anger
584,"When they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would inevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them to pass it by.",anger
585,But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him.,anger
586,"Again, as the marsh was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.",joy
587,Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge.,anger
588,Vassenka Veslovsky was the first to run after the dog.,anger
589,"Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come up, a grouse flew out.",anger
590,Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow.,anger
591,This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up.,anger
592,"Krak found it again and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.",anger
593,"“Now you go and I’ll stay with the horses,” he said.",anger
594,Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman’s envy.,sadness
595,He handed the reins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.,anger
596,"Laska, who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment, flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that Levin knew well, and that Krak had not yet come upon.",joy
597,“Why don’t you stop her?” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
598,"“She won’t scare them,” answered Levin, sympathizing with his bitch’s pleasure and hurrying after her.",sadness
599,As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was more and more earnestness in Laska’s exploration.,joy
600,A little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant.,joy
601,"She made one circuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly quivered with excitement and became motionless.",joy
602,"“Come, come, Stiva!” shouted Levin, feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud, began to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of distance.",fear
603,"He heard the steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse.",anger
604,"He heard too, not far behind him, a splashing in the water, which he could not explain to himself.",anger
605,"Picking his steps, he moved up to the dog.",anger
606,“Fetch it!” Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog.,anger
607,"Levin had lifted his gun, but at the very instant when he was taking aim, the sound of splashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of Veslovsky’s voice, shouting something with strange loudness.",fear
608,"Levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he fired.",anger
609,"When he had made sure he had missed, Levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.",anger
610,"Veslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and got the horses stuck in the mud.",anger
611,"“Damn the fellow!” Levin said to himself, as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire.",anger
612,"“What did you drive in for?” he said to him dryly, and calling the coachman, he began pulling the horses out.",anger
613,"Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither Stepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out, since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing.",anger
614,"Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to Vassenka’s protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses.",anger
615,"But then, as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards, so that he broke it indeed, Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday’s feelings been too cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness.",anger
616,"When everything had been put right, and the carriage had been brought back to the road, Levin had the lunch served.",anger
617,“_Bon appétit—bonne conscience!,joy
618,"Ce poulet va tomber jusqu’au fond de mes bottes_,” Vassenka, who had recovered his spirits, quoted the French saying as he finished his second chicken.",joy
619,"“Well, now our troubles are over, now everything’s going to go well.",joy
620,"Only, to atone for my sins, I’m bound to sit on the box.",anger
621,That’s so?,anger
622,eh?,joy
623,"No, no!",joy
624,I’ll be your Automedon.,anger
625,"You shall see how I’ll get you along,” he answered, not letting go the rein, when Levin begged him to let the coachman drive.",anger
626,"“No, I must atone for my sins, and I’m very comfortable on the box.” And he drove.",anger
627,"Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses, especially the chestnut, whom he did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh.",anger
628,"Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too early, while it was still hot.",anger
629,"As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their expedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of Vassenka and be free in his movements.",anger
630,"Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently had the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together with a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.",joy
631,“How shall we go?,anger
632,"It’s a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds hovering over the reeds.",joy
633,"“Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.” “Now, gentlemen,” said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression, “do you see those reeds?” He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river.",sadness
634,"“The marsh begins here, straight in front of us, do you see—where it is greener?",anger
635,"From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding places there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that alder, and right up to the mill.",anger
636,"Over there, do you see, where the pools are?",joy
637,That’s the best place.,joy
638,There I once shot seventeen snipe.,joy
639,"We’ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then meet over there at the mill.” “Well, which shall go to left and which to right?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
640,"“It’s wider to the right; you two go that way and I’ll take the left,” he said with apparent carelessness.",anger
641,“Capital!,anger
642,we’ll make the bigger bag!,joy
643,"Yes, come along, come along!” Vassenka exclaimed.",anger
644,"Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.",anger
645,"As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about together and made towards the green, slime-covered pool.",joy
646,"Levin knew Laska’s method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe.",fear
647,"“Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!” he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him.",anger
648,"Levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after that casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.",joy
649,"“Oh, I won’t get in your way, don’t trouble about me.” But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty’s words at parting: “Mind you don’t shoot one another.” The dogs came nearer and nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent.",joy
650,"The expectation of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own heel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a snipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.",anger
651,“Bang!,anger
652,bang!” sounded almost in his ear.,anger
653,"Vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment towards the sportsmen, far out of range.",anger
654,"Before Levin had time to look round, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some eight more rose one after another.",anger
655,"Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud.",sadness
656,"Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing showing white beneath.",anger
657,"Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, and missed; he aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting him so that he missed again.",sadness
658,"While they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky, who had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the water.",anger
659,"Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe, and with sparkling eyes looked at Levin.",anger
660,"“Well, now let us separate,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and limping on his left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog, he walked off in one direction.",anger
661,Levin and Veslovsky walked in the other.,anger
662,"It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure he got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day.",anger
663,So it was that day.,anger
664,The snipe showed themselves in numbers.,anger
665,"They kept flying up from just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen’s legs, and Levin might have retrieved his ill luck.",anger
666,"But the more he shot, the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success.",sadness
667,"Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain himself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting.",anger
668,"Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this.",anger
669,"She began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as it were, with perplexity or reproach in her eyes.",anger
670,Shots followed shots in rapid succession.,joy
671,"The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen, while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light little snipe.",joy
672,"And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky alone, and one by both of them together.",anger
673,"Meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s shots, not frequent, but, as Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each they heard “Krak, Krak, _apporte_!” This excited Levin still more.",joy
674,The snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds.,anger
675,"Their whirring wings close to the earth, and their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again before the sportsmen.",anger
676,Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.,anger
677,"After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky reached the place where the peasants’ mowing-grass was divided into long strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the trampled grass, in another by a path mown through it.",anger
678,Half of these strips had already been mown.,anger
679,"Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him, and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.",anger
680,"“Hi, sportsmen!” shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on an unharnessed cart; “come and have some lunch with us!",anger
681,Have a drop of wine!” Levin looked round.,anger
682,"“Come along, it’s all right!” shouted a good-humored-looking bearded peasant with a red face, showing his white teeth in a grin, and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight.",anger
683,“_Qu’est-ce qu’ils disent_?” asked Veslovsky.,anger
684,“They invite you to have some vodka.,anger
685,Most likely they’ve been dividing the meadow into lots.,joy
686,"I should have some,” said Levin, not without some guile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka, and would go away to them.",anger
687,"“Why do they offer it?” “Oh, they’re merry-making.",joy
688,"Really, you should join them.",anger
689,"You would be interested.” “_Allons, c’est curieux_.” “You go, you go, you’ll find the way to the mill!” cried Levin, and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky, bent and stumbling with weariness, holding his gun out at arm’s length, was making his way out of the marsh towards the peasants.",anger
690,“You come too!” the peasants shouted to Levin.,anger
691,“Never fear!,fear
692,You taste our cake!” Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread.,joy
693,"He was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he hesitated.",sadness
694,But Laska was setting.,anger
695,"And immediately all his weariness vanished, and he walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog.",anger
696,A snipe flew up at his feet; he fired and killed it.,anger
697,Laska still pointed.—“Fetch it!” Another bird flew up close to the dog.,anger
698,Levin fired.,anger
699,"But it was an unlucky day for him; he missed it, and when he went to look for the one he had shot, he could not find that either.",anger
700,"He wandered all about the reeds, but Laska did not believe he had shot it, and when he sent her to find it, she pretended to hunt for it, but did not really.",anger
701,"And in the absence of Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame of his failure, things went no better.",anger
702,"There were plenty of snipe still, but Levin made one miss after another.",anger
703,"The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes, soaked through with perspiration, stuck to his body; his left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat ran in drops down his powder-grimed face, his mouth was full of the bitter taste, his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water, his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he could not touch the stock of his gun, it was so hot; his heart beat with short, rapid throbs; his hands shook with excitement, and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp, but still he walked on and still he shot.",sadness
704,"At last, after a disgraceful miss, he flung his gun and his hat on the ground.",anger
705,"“No, I must control myself,” he said to himself.",anger
706,"Picking up his gun and his hat, he called Laska, and went out of the swamp.",anger
707,"When he got on to dry ground he sat down, pulled off his boot and emptied it, then walked to the marsh, drank some stagnant-tasting water, moistened his burning hot gun, and washed his face and hands.",anger
708,"Feeling refreshed, he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to keep cool.",joy
709,"He tried to be calm, but it was the same again.",anger
710,His finger pressed the cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird.,anger
711,It got worse and worse.,anger
712,He had only five birds in his game-bag when he walked out of the marsh towards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
713,Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog.,anger
714,"Krak darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror sniffed at Laska.",anger
715,Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
716,"He came to meet him, red and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the same way.",anger
717,“Well?,anger
718,"You have been popping away!” he said, smiling good-humoredly.",joy
719,“How have you got on?” queried Levin.,anger
720,"But there was no need to ask, for he had already seen the full game bag.",joy
721,"“Oh, pretty fair.” He had fourteen birds.",joy
722,“A splendid marsh!,joy
723,I’ve no doubt Veslovsky got in your way.,anger
724,"It’s awkward too, shooting with one dog,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, to soften his triumph.",sadness
725,"When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant’s hut where Levin always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there.",anger
726,"He was sitting in the middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier, the brother of the peasant’s wife, who was helping him off with his miry boots.",sadness
727,"Veslovsky was laughing his infectious, good-humored laugh.",anger
728,“I’ve only just come.,anger
729,_Ils ont été charmants_.,anger
730,"Just fancy, they gave me drink, fed me!",anger
731,"Such bread, it was exquisite!",anger
732,"_Délicieux!_ And the vodka, I never tasted any better.",joy
733,And they would not take a penny for anything.,anger
734,And they kept saying: ‘Excuse our homely ways.’” “What should they take anything for?,joy
735,"They were entertaining you, to be sure.",joy
736,"Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?” said the soldier, succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened stocking.",anger
737,"In spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and the smell of marsh mud and powder that filled the room, and the absence of knives and forks, the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen.",joy
738,"Washed and clean, they went into a hay-barn swept ready for them, where the coachman had been making up beds for the gentlemen.",anger
739,"Though it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep.",anger
740,"After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns, of dogs, and of former shooting parties, the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them.",anger
741,"After Vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay, this delightful broken cart (he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out), of the good nature of the peasants that had treated him to vodka, of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters, Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at Malthus’s, where he had stayed the previous summer.",joy
742,"Malthus was a well-known capitalist, who had made his money by speculation in railway shares.",anger
743,"Stepan Arkadyevitch described what grouse moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province, and how they were preserved, and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh.",anger
744,"“I don’t understand you,” said Levin, sitting up in the hay; “how is it such people don’t disgust you?",sadness
745,"I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is all very pleasant, but don’t you dislike just that very sumptuousness?",joy
746,"All these people, just like our spirit monopolists in old days, get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone.",anger
747,"They don’t care for their contempt, and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved.” “Perfectly true!” chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky.",joy
748,“Perfectly!,anger
749,"Oblonsky, of course, goes out of _bonhomie_, but other people say: ‘Well, Oblonsky stays with them.’...” “Not a bit of it.” Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he spoke.",joy
750,“I simply don’t consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman.,anger
751,"They’ve all made their money alike—by their work and their intelligence.” “Oh, by what work?",anger
752,Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them?” “Of course it’s work.,anger
753,"Work in this sense, that if it were not for him and others like him, there would have been no railways.” “But that’s not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned profession.” “Granted, but it’s work in the sense that his activity produces a result—the railways.",joy
754,"But of course you think the railways useless.” “No, that’s another question; I am prepared to admit that they’re useful.",joy
755,"But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest.” “But who is to define what is proportionate?” “Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,” said Levin, conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty.",joy
756,"“Such as banking, for instance,” he went on.",anger
757,"“It’s an evil—the amassing of huge fortunes without labor, just the same thing as with the spirit monopolies, it’s only the form that’s changed.",anger
758,"_Le roi est mort, vive le roi_.",anger
759,"No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways came up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without work.” “Yes, that may all be very true and clever....",joy
760,"Lie down, Krak!” Stepan Arkadyevitch called to his dog, who was scratching and turning over all the hay.",anger
761,"He was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position, and so talked serenely and without haste.",anger
762,“But you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work.,anger
763,"That I receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk, though he knows more about the work than I do—that’s dishonest, I suppose?” “I can’t say.” “Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let’s say, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here, however hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus getting more than a station-master.",joy
764,"No, quite the contrary; I see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which is utterly baseless, and I fancy there’s envy at the bottom of it....” “No, that’s unfair,” said Veslovsky; “how could envy come in?",anger
765,"There is something not nice about that sort of business.” “You say,” Levin went on, “that it’s unjust for me to receive five thousand, while the peasant has fifty; that’s true.",joy
766,"It is unfair, and I feel it, but....” “It really is.",joy
767,"Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, shooting, doing nothing, while they are forever at work?” said Vassenka Veslovsky, obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question, and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity.",joy
768,"“Yes, you feel it, but you don’t give him your property,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, intentionally, as it seemed, provoking Levin.",anger
769,"There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married sisters, a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best, and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation, as it began to take a personal note.",joy
770,"“I don’t give it away, because no one demands that from me, and if I wanted to, I could not give it away,” answered Levin, “and have no one to give it to.” “Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.” “Yes, but how am I to give it up?",anger
771,Am I to go to him and make a deed of conveyance?” “I don’t know; but if you are convinced that you have no right....” “I’m not at all convinced.,joy
772,"On the contrary, I feel I have no right to give it up, that I have duties both to the land and to my family.” “No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why is it you don’t act accordingly?...” “Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me.” “No, excuse me, that’s a paradox.” “Yes, there’s something of a sophistry about that,” Veslovsky agreed.",anger
773,“Ah!,anger
774,"our host; so you’re not asleep yet?” he said to the peasant who came into the barn, opening the creaking door.",anger
775,"“How is it you’re not asleep?” “No, how’s one to sleep!",sadness
776,"I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, but I heard them chattering.",anger
777,I want to get a hook from here.,anger
778,"She won’t bite?” he added, stepping cautiously with his bare feet.",fear
779,"“And where are you going to sleep?” “We are going out for the night with the beasts.” “Ah, what a night!” said Veslovsky, looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors.",joy
780,"“But listen, there are women’s voices singing, and, on my word, not badly too.",sadness
781,"Who’s that singing, my friend?” “That’s the maids from hard by here.” “Let’s go, let’s have a walk!",anger
782,"We shan’t go to sleep, you know.",anger
783,"Oblonsky, come along!” “If one could only do both, lie here and go,” answered Oblonsky, stretching.",anger
784,"“It’s capital lying here.” “Well, I shall go by myself,” said Veslovsky, getting up eagerly, and putting on his shoes and stockings.",anger
785,"“Good-bye, gentlemen.",joy
786,"If it’s fun, I’ll fetch you.",joy
787,"You’ve treated me to some good sport, and I won’t forget you.” “He really is a capital fellow, isn’t he?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him.",anger
788,"“Yes, capital,” answered Levin, still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before.",anger
789,"It seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity, and yet both of them, straightforward men and not fools, had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries.",joy
790,This disconcerted him.,anger
791,"“It’s just this, my dear boy.",anger
792,"One must do one of two things: either admit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick up for one’s rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.” “No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied—at least I could not.",anger
793,"The great thing for me is to feel that I’m not to blame.” “What do you say, why not go after all?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, evidently weary of the strain of thought.",sadness
794,"“We shan’t go to sleep, you know.",anger
795,"Come, let’s go!” Levin did not answer.",anger
796,"What they had said in the conversation, that he acted justly only in a negative sense, absorbed his thoughts.",sadness
797,“Can it be that it’s only possible to be just negatively?” he was asking himself.,anger
798,"“How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up.",joy
799,“There’s not a chance of sleeping.,sadness
800,Vassenka has been getting up some fun there.,joy
801,Do you hear the laughing and his voice?,joy
802,Hadn’t we better go?,joy
803,"Come along!” “No, I’m not coming,” answered Levin.",joy
804,"“Surely that’s not a matter of principle too,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he felt about in the dark for his cap.",sadness
805,"“It’s not a matter of principle, but why should I go?” “But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, finding his cap and getting up.",anger
806,“How so?” “Do you suppose I don’t see the line you’ve taken up with your wife?,anger
807,"I heard how it’s a question of the greatest consequence, whether or not you’re to be away for a couple of days’ shooting.",anger
808,"That’s all very well as an idyllic episode, but for your whole life that won’t answer.",joy
809,A man must be independent; he has his masculine interests.,anger
810,"A man has to be manly,” said Oblonsky, opening the door.",anger
811,“In what way?,anger
812,To go running after servant girls?” said Levin.,anger
813,"“Why not, if it amuses him?",anger
814,_Ça ne tire pas à conséquence_.,anger
815,"It won’t do my wife any harm, and it’ll amuse me.",anger
816,The great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home.,joy
817,There should be nothing in the home.,anger
818,"But don’t tie your own hands.” “Perhaps so,” said Levin dryly, and he turned on his side.",anger
819,"“Tomorrow, early, I want to go shooting, and I won’t wake anyone, and shall set off at daybreak.” “_Messieurs, venez vite!_” they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming back.",anger
820,“_Charmante!_ I’ve made such a discovery.,joy
821,"_Charmante!_ a perfect Gretchen, and I’ve already made friends with her.",joy
822,"Really, exceedingly pretty,” he declared in a tone of approval, as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account, and he was expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him.",joy
823,"Levin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his slippers, and lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon their voices were lost.",sadness
824,For a long while Levin could not get to sleep.,anger
825,"He heard the horses munching hay, then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready for the night, and going off for the night watch with the beasts, then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn, with his nephew, the younger son of their peasant host.",joy
826,"He heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs, who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures, and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day, and the soldier in a husky, sleepy voice, telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh, and would shoot with their guns; and then, to check the boy’s questions, he said, “Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or you’ll catch it,” and soon after he began snoring himself, and everything was still.",sadness
827,"He could only hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry of a snipe.",anger
828,“Is it really only negative?” he repeated to himself.,anger
829,"“Well, what of it?",anger
830,It’s not my fault.” And he began thinking about the next day.,anger
831,"“Tomorrow I’ll go out early, and I’ll make a point of keeping cool.",joy
832,There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too.,joy
833,When I come back there’ll be the note from Kitty.,anger
834,"Yes, Stiva may be right, I’m not manly with her, I’m tied to her apron-strings.... Well, it can’t be helped!",joy
835,"Negative again....” Half asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.",sadness
836,"For an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was up, and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they were standing talking.",joy
837,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the freshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and Veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words, probably said to him by a peasant: “Ah, you do your best to get round her!” Levin, half asleep, said: “Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!” and fell asleep.",sadness
838,"Waking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his companions.",anger
839,"Vassenka, lying on his stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust out, was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response.",anger
840,"Oblonsky, half asleep, declined to get up so early.",anger
841,"Even Laska, who was asleep, curled up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after the other.",anger
842,"Getting on his boots and stockings, taking his gun, and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn, Levin went out into the road.",anger
843,"The coachmen were sleeping in their carriages, the horses were dozing.",anger
844,"Only one was lazily eating oats, dipping its nose into the manger.",anger
845,It was still gray out-of-doors.,anger
846,"“Why are you up so early, my dear?” the old woman, their hostess, said, coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old friend.",anger
847,"“Going shooting, granny.",anger
848,"Do I go this way to the marsh?” “Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp patches; there’s a little footpath.” Stepping carefully with her sunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved back the fence for him by the threshing floor.",sadness
849,“Straight on and you’ll come to the marsh.,anger
850,Our lads drove the cattle there yesterday evening.” Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path.,anger
851,"Levin followed her with a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky.",joy
852,He hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh.,anger
853,But the sun did not delay.,anger
854,"The moon, which had been bright when he went out, by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver.",joy
855,"The pink flush of dawn, which one could not help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at all.",anger
856,"What were before undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen.",fear
857,They were sheaves of rye.,fear
858,"The dew, not visible till the sun was up, wetted Levin’s legs and his blouse above his belt in the high growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which the pollen had already fallen out.",sadness
859,In the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible.,joy
860,A bee flew by Levin’s ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet.,anger
861,"He looked carefully, and saw a second and a third.",anger
862,"They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge, and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh.",anger
863,The path led straight to the marsh.,anger
864,"The marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it, thicker in one place and thinner in another, so that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist.",joy
865,"At the edge of the marsh and the road, peasant boys and men, who had been herding for the night, were lying, and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats.",fear
866,Not far from them were three hobbled horses.,anger
867,One of them clanked a chain.,anger
868,"Laska walked beside her master, pressing a little forward and looking round.",anger
869,"Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds, Levin examined his pistols and let his dog off.",anger
870,"One of the horses, a sleek, dark-brown three-year-old, seeing the dog, started away, switched its tail and snorted.",anger
871,"The other horses too were frightened, and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs, and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound, they bounded out of the marsh.",fear
872,"Laska stopped, looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at Levin.",anger
873,"Levin patted Laska, and whistled as a sign that she might begin.",anger
874,Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under her.,anger
875,"Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh plants, and slime, and the extraneous smell of horse dung, Laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent of that strong-smelling bird that always excited her more than any other.",joy
876,"Here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong, but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter.",fear
877,"To find the direction, she had to go farther away from the wind.",anger
878,"Not feeling the motion of her legs, Laska bounded with a stiff gallop, so that at each bound she could stop short, to the right, away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise, and turned facing the wind.",sadness
879,"Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she felt at once that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her, and not one, but many.",sadness
880,Laska slackened her speed.,anger
881,"They were here, but where precisely she could not yet determine.",anger
882,"To find the very spot, she began to make a circle, when suddenly her master’s voice drew her off.",anger
883,“Laska!,anger
884,"here?” he asked, pointing her to a different direction.",anger
885,"She stopped, asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun.",anger
886,"But he repeated his command in an angry voice, pointing to a spot covered with water, where there could not be anything.",anger
887,"She obeyed him, pretending she was looking, so as to please him, went round it, and went back to her former position, and was at once aware of the scent again.",joy
888,"Now when he was not hindering her, she knew what to do, and without looking at what was under her feet, and to her vexation stumbling over a high stump into the water, but righting herself with her strong, supple legs, she began making the circle which was to make all clear to her.",joy
889,"The scent of them reached her, stronger and stronger, and more and more defined, and all at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here, behind this tuft of reeds, five paces in front of her; she stopped, and her whole body was still and rigid.",fear
890,"On her short legs she could see nothing in front of her, but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off.",joy
891,"She stood still, feeling more and more conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation.",joy
892,"Her tail was stretched straight and tense, and only wagging at the extreme end.",anger
893,"Her mouth was slightly open, her ears raised.",joy
894,"One ear had been turned wrong side out as she ran up, and she breathed heavily but warily, and still more warily looked round, but more with her eyes than her head, to her master.",anger
895,"He was coming along with the face she knew so well, though the eyes were always terrible to her.",anger
896,"He stumbled over the stump as he came, and moved, as she thought, extraordinarily slowly.",fear
897,"She thought he came slowly, but he was running.",anger
898,"Noticing Laska’s special attitude as she crouched on the ground, as it were, scratching big prints with her hind paws, and with her mouth slightly open, Levin knew she was pointing at grouse, and with an inward prayer for luck, especially with the first bird, he ran up to her.",anger
899,"Coming quite close up to her, he could from his height look beyond her, and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose.",anger
900,"In a space between two little thickets, at a couple of yards’ distance, he could see a grouse.",anger
901,"Turning its head, it was listening.",anger
902,"Then lightly preening and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail.",anger
903,"“Fetch it, fetch it!” shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind.",anger
904,"“But I can’t go,” thought Laska.",anger
905,“Where am I to go?,anger
906,"From here I feel them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or who they are.” But then he shoved her with his knee, and in an excited whisper said, “Fetch it, Laska.” “Well, if that’s what he wishes, I’ll do it, but I can’t answer for myself now,” she thought, and darted forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the thick bushes.",joy
907,"She scented nothing now; she could only see and hear, without understanding anything.",joy
908,Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wings.,fear
909,And immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire.,sadness
910,"Another bird did not linger, but rose behind Levin without the dog.",anger
911,"When Levin turned towards it, it was already some way off.",anger
912,But his shot caught it.,anger
913,"Flying twenty paces further, the second grouse rose upwards, and whirling round like a ball, dropped heavily on a dry place.",fear
914,"“Come, this is going to be some good!” thought Levin, packing the warm and fat grouse into his game bag.",joy
915,"“Eh, Laska, will it be good?” When Levin, after loading his gun, moved on, the sun had fully risen, though unseen behind the storm-clouds.",joy
916,"The moon had lost all of its luster, and was like a white cloud in the sky.",joy
917,Not a single star could be seen.,anger
918,"The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like gold.",joy
919,The stagnant pools were all like amber.,joy
920,The blue of the grass had changed to yellow-green.,joy
921,The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows.,joy
922,"A hawk woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh.",anger
923,"Crows were flying about the field, and a bare-legged boy was driving the horses to an old man, who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair.",anger
924,The smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.,joy
925,One of the boys ran up to Levin.,anger
926,"“Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!” he shouted to him, and he walked a little way off behind him.",anger
927,"And Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed his approval, at killing three snipe, one after another, straight off.",joy
928,"The sportsman’s saying, that if the first beast or the first bird is not missed, the day will be lucky, turned out correct.",anger
929,"At ten o’clock Levin, weary, hungry, and happy after a tramp of twenty miles, returned to his night’s lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck, which he tied to his belt, as it would not go into the game bag.",joy
930,"His companions had long been awake, and had had time to get hungry and have breakfast.",anger
931,"“Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen,” said Levin, counting a second time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so much less important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads crooked aside, than they did when they were flying.",anger
932,"The number was verified, and Stepan Arkadyevitch’s envy pleased Levin.",joy
933,He was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by Kitty with a note was already there.,joy
934,“I am perfectly well and happy.,joy
935,"If you were uneasy about me, you can feel easier than ever.",joy
936,"I’ve a new bodyguard, Marya Vlasyevna,”—this was the midwife, a new and important personage in Levin’s domestic life.",joy
937,“She has come to have a look at me.,anger
938,"She found me perfectly well, and we have kept her till you are back.",joy
939,"All are happy and well, and please, don’t be in a hurry to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay another day.” These two pleasures, his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife, were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly over Levin.",anger
940,"One was that the chestnut trace horse, who had been unmistakably overworked on the previous day, was off his feed and out of sorts.",anger
941,"The coachman said he was “Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",anger
942,"Yes, indeed!",joy
943,"driven ten miles with no sense!” The other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his good humor, though later he laughed at it a great deal, was to find that of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that one would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left.",anger
944,"On his way back, tired and hungry from shooting, Levin had so distinct a vision of meat-pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste them, as Laska had smelt the game, and he immediately told Philip to give him some.",sadness
945,"It appeared that there were no pies left, nor even any chicken.",anger
946,"“Well, this fellow’s appetite!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing and pointing at Vassenka Veslovsky.",anger
947,"“I never suffer from loss of appetite, but he’s really marvelous!...” “Well, it can’t be helped,” said Levin, looking gloomily at Veslovsky.",joy
948,"“Well, Philip, give me some beef, then.” “The beef’s been eaten, and the bones given to the dogs,” answered Philip.",anger
949,"Levin was so hurt that he said, in a tone of vexation, “You might have left me something!” and he felt ready to cry.",joy
950,"“Then put away the game,” he said in a shaking voice to Philip, trying not to look at Vassenka, “and cover them with some nettles.",anger
951,"And you might at least ask for some milk for me.” But when he had drunk some milk, he felt ashamed immediately at having shown his annoyance to a stranger, and he began to laugh at his hungry mortification.",sadness
952,"In the evening they went shooting again, and Veslovsky had several successful shots, and in the night they drove home.",anger
953,Their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been.,joy
954,"Veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the peasants, who had regaled him with vodka, and said to him, “Excuse our homely ways,” and his night’s adventures with kiss-in-the-ring and the servant-girl and the peasant, who had asked him was he married, and on learning that he was not, said to him, “Well, mind you don’t run after other men’s wives—you’d better get one of your own.” These words had particularly amused Veslovsky.",joy
955,"“Altogether, I’ve enjoyed our outing awfully.",joy
956,"And you, Levin?” “I have, very much,” Levin said quite sincerely.",joy
957,"It was particularly delightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling towards Vassenka Veslovsky at home, and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to him.",joy
958,"Next day at ten o’clock Levin, who had already gone his rounds, knocked at the room where Vassenka had been put for the night.",anger
959,“_Entrez!_” Veslovsky called to him.,anger
960,"“Excuse me, I’ve only just finished my ablutions,” he said, smiling, standing before him in his underclothes only.",anger
961,"“Don’t mind me, please.” Levin sat down in the window.",anger
962,“Have you slept well?” “Like the dead.,anger
963,"What sort of day is it for shooting?” “What will you take, tea or coffee?” “Neither.",anger
964,I’ll wait till lunch.,joy
965,I’m really ashamed.,sadness
966,I suppose the ladies are down?,anger
967,A walk now would be capital.,anger
968,"You show me your horses.” After walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, Levin returned to the house with his guest, and went with him into the drawing-room.",joy
969,"“We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!” said Veslovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting at the samovar.",joy
970,"“What a pity ladies are cut off from these delights!” “Well, I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house,” Levin said to himself.",joy
971,"Again he fancied something in the smile, in the all-conquering air with which their guest addressed Kitty....",joy
972,"The princess, sitting on the other side of the table with Marya Vlasyevna and Stepan Arkadyevitch, called Levin to her side, and began to talk to him about moving to Moscow for Kitty’s confinement, and getting ready rooms for them.",joy
973,"Just as Levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding, as derogatory to the grandeur of the event, now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it seemed, on their fingers.",anger
974,"He tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby; tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious, endless strips of knitting, the triangles of linen, and so on, to which Dolly attached special importance.",joy
975,"The birth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which was promised him, but which he still could not believe in—so marvelous it seemed—presented itself to his mind, on one hand, as a happiness so immense, and therefore so incredible; on the other, as an event so mysterious, that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be, and consequent preparation for it, as for something ordinary that did happen to people, jarred on him as confusing and humiliating.",sadness
976,"But the princess did not understand his feelings, and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference, and so she gave him no peace.",joy
977,"She had commissioned Stepan Arkadyevitch to look at a flat, and now she called Levin up.",anger
978,"“I know nothing about it, princess.",joy
979,"Do as you think fit,” he said.",joy
980,“You must decide when you will move.” “I really don’t know.,joy
981,"I know millions of children are born away from Moscow, and doctors ... why....” “But if so....” “Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.” “We can’t talk to Kitty about it!",joy
982,Do you want me to frighten her?,anger
983,"Why, this spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor.” “I will do just what you say,” he said gloomily.",anger
984,"The princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her.",anger
985,"Though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him, he was gloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he saw at the samovar.",anger
986,"“No, it’s impossible,” he thought, glancing now and then at Vassenka bending over Kitty, telling her something with his charming smile, and at her, flushed and disturbed.",joy
987,"There was something not nice in Vassenka’s attitude, in his eyes, in his smile.",joy
988,Levin even saw something not nice in Kitty’s attitude and look.,joy
989,And again the light died away in his eyes.,anger
990,"Again, as before, all of a sudden, without the slightest transition, he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of despair, rage, and humiliation.",sadness
991,Again everything and everyone had become hateful to him.,anger
992,"“You do just as you think best, princess,” he said again, looking round.",joy
993,"“Heavy is the cap of Monomach,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said playfully, hinting, evidently, not simply at the princess’s conversation, but at the cause of Levin’s agitation, which he had noticed.",anger
994,"“How late you are today, Dolly!” Everyone got up to greet Darya Alexandrovna.",anger
995,"Vassenka only rose for an instant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation again, laughing at something.",joy
996,“I’ve been worried about Masha.,fear
997,"She did not sleep well, and is dreadfully tiresome today,” said Dolly.",joy
998,"The conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening, discussing Anna, and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations.",joy
999,"Kitty disliked the conversation, and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband.",anger
1000,"But she was too simple and innocent to know how to cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young man’s very obvious admiration.",joy
1001,"She wanted to stop it, but she did not know what to do.",anger
1002,"Whatever she did she knew would be observed by her husband, and the worst interpretation put on it.",anger
1003,"And, in fact, when she asked Dolly what was wrong with Masha, and Vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over, began to gaze indifferently at Dolly, the question struck Levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy.",anger
1004,"“What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?” said Dolly.",joy
1005,"“By all means, please, and I shall come too,” said Kitty, and she blushed.",anger
1006,"She wanted from politeness to ask Vassenka whether he would come, and she did not ask him.",anger
1007,"“Where are you going, Kostya?” she asked her husband with a guilty face, as he passed by her with a resolute step.",sadness
1008,This guilty air confirmed all his suspicions.,joy
1009,"“The mechanician came when I was away; I haven’t seen him yet,” he said, not looking at her.",anger
1010,"He went downstairs, but before he had time to leave his study he heard his wife’s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him.",anger
1011,“What do you want?” he said to her shortly.,anger
1012,"“We are busy.” “I beg your pardon,” she said to the German mechanician; “I want a few words with my husband.” The German would have left the room, but Levin said to him: “Don’t disturb yourself.” “The train is at three?” queried the German.",anger
1013,"“I mustn’t be late.” Levin did not answer him, but walked out himself with his wife.",anger
1014,"“Well, what have you to say to me?” he said to her in French.",anger
1015,"He did not look her in the face, and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, crushed look.",sadness
1016,“I ...,anger
1017,I want to say that we can’t go on like this; that this is misery....” she said.,sadness
1018,"“The servants are here at the sideboard,” he said angrily; “don’t make a scene.” “Well, let’s go in here!” They were standing in the passage.",anger
1019,"Kitty would have gone into the next room, but there the English governess was giving Tanya a lesson.",anger
1020,"“Well, come into the garden.” In the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path.",anger
1021,"And no longer considering that the peasant could see her tear-stained and his agitated face, that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster, they went on with rapid steps, feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings, must be alone together, and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling.",sadness
1022,“We can’t go on like this!,anger
1023,It’s misery!,sadness
1024,I am wretched; you are wretched.,sadness
1025,"What for?” she said, when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue.",joy
1026,"“But tell me one thing: was there in his tone anything unseemly, not nice, humiliatingly horrible?” he said, standing before her again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest, as he had stood before her that night.",joy
1027,"“Yes,” she said in a shaking voice; “but, Kostya, surely you see I’m not to blame?",sadness
1028,All the morning I’ve been trying to take a tone ... but such people.... Why did he come?,anger
1029,"How happy we were!” she said, breathless with the sobs that shook her.",joy
1030,"Although nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing to run away from, and they could not possibly have found anything very delightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment that they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces.",joy
1031,"After escorting his wife upstairs, Levin went to Dolly’s part of the house.",anger
1032,"Darya Alexandrovna, for her part, was in great distress too that day.",joy
1033,"She was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl, who stood in the corner roaring.",anger
1034,"“And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all alone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won’t make you a new frock,” she said, not knowing how to punish her.",joy
1035,"“Oh, she is a disgusting child!” she turned to Levin.",anger
1036,"“Where does she get such wicked propensities?” “Why, what has she done?” Levin said without much interest, for he had wanted to ask her advice, and so was annoyed that he had come at an unlucky moment.",anger
1037,"“Grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there ...",anger
1038,I can’t tell you really what she did.,anger
1039,It’s a thousand pities Miss Elliot’s not with us.,anger
1040,This one sees to nothing—she’s a machine.... _Figurez-vous que la petite_?...” And Darya Alexandrovna described Masha’s crime.,anger
1041,"“That proves nothing; it’s not a question of evil propensities at all, it’s simply mischief,” Levin assured her.",joy
1042,“But you are upset about something?,anger
1043,What have you come for?” asked Dolly.,anger
1044,“What’s going on there?” And in the tone of her question Levin heard that it would be easy for him to say what he had meant to say.,anger
1045,"“I’ve not been in there, I’ve been alone in the garden with Kitty.",anger
1046,"We’ve had a quarrel for the second time since ... Stiva came.” Dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.",anger
1047,"“Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in Kitty, but in that gentleman’s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant—not unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?” “You mean, how shall I say.... Stay, stay in the corner!” she said to Masha, who, detecting a faint smile in her mother’s face, had been turning round.",sadness
1048,“The opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as young men do behave.,anger
1049,"_Il fait la cour à une jeune et jolie femme_, and a husband who’s a man of the world should only be flattered by it.” “Yes, yes,” said Levin gloomily; “but you noticed it?” “Not only I, but Stiva noticed it.",anger
1050,"Just after breakfast he said to me in so many words, _Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à Kitty_.” “Well, that’s all right then; now I’m satisfied.",joy
1051,"I’ll send him away,” said Levin.",anger
1052,“What do you mean!,anger
1053,"Are you crazy?” Dolly cried in horror; “nonsense, Kostya, only think!” she said, laughing.",anger
1054,"“You can go now to Fanny,” she said to Masha.",anger
1055,"“No, if you wish it, I’ll speak to Stiva.",anger
1056,He’ll take him away.,anger
1057,He can say you’re expecting visitors.,joy
1058,"Altogether he doesn’t fit into the house.” “No, no, I’ll do it myself.” “But you’ll quarrel with him?” “Not a bit.",anger
1059,"I shall so enjoy it,” Levin said, his eyes flashing with real enjoyment.",joy
1060,"“Come, forgive her, Dolly, she won’t do it again,” he said of the little sinner, who had not gone to Fanny, but was standing irresolutely before her mother, waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her mother’s eye.",anger
1061,The mother glanced at her.,anger
1062,"The child broke into sobs, hid her face on her mother’s lap, and Dolly laid her thin, tender hand on her head.",anger
1063,"“And what is there in common between us and him?” thought Levin, and he went off to look for Veslovsky.",anger
1064,As he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station.,anger
1065,"“The spring was broken yesterday,” said the footman.",anger
1066,"“Well, the covered trap, then, and make haste.",joy
1067,"Where’s the visitor?” “The gentleman’s gone to his room.” Levin came upon Veslovsky at the moment when the latter, having unpacked his things from his trunk, and laid out some new songs, was putting on his gaiters to go out riding.",anger
1068,"Whether there was something exceptional in Levin’s face, or that Vassenka was himself conscious that _ce petit brin de cour_ he was making was out of place in this family, but he was somewhat (as much as a young man in society can be) disconcerted at Levin’s entrance.",joy
1069,"“You ride in gaiters?” “Yes, it’s much cleaner,” said Vassenka, putting his fat leg on a chair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling with simple-hearted good humor.",joy
1070,"He was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and Levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on Vassenka’s face.",sadness
1071,"On the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning, trying their strength.",fear
1072,"Levin took the fragment in his hands and began smashing it up, breaking bits off the stick, not knowing how to begin.",anger
1073,"“I wanted....” He paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty and everything that had happened, he said, looking him resolutely in the face: “I have ordered the horses to be put-to for you.” “How so?” Vassenka began in surprise.",anger
1074,"“To drive where?” “For you to drive to the station,” Levin said gloomily.",anger
1075,"“Are you going away, or has something happened?” “It happens that I expect visitors,” said Levin, his strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick.",anger
1076,"“And I’m not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but I beg you to go away.",anger
1077,You can explain my rudeness as you like.” Vassenka drew himself up.,anger
1078,"“I beg you to explain....” he said with dignity, understanding at last.",anger
1079,"“I can’t explain,” Levin said softly and deliberately, trying to control the trembling of his jaw; “and you’d better not ask.” And as the split ends were all broken off, Levin clutched the thick ends in his finger, broke the stick in two, and carefully caught the end as it fell.",anger
1080,"Probably the sight of those nervous fingers, of the muscles he had proved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft voice, and quivering jaws, convinced Vassenka better than any words.",fear
1081,"He bowed, shrugging his shoulders, and smiling contemptuously.",joy
1082,“Can I not see Oblonsky?” The shrug and the smile did not irritate Levin.,anger
1083,“What else was there for him to do?” he thought.,anger
1084,"“I’ll send him to you at once.” “What madness is this?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said when, after hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house, he found Levin in the garden, where he was walking about waiting for his guest’s departure.",anger
1085,“_Mais c’est ridicule!_ What fly has stung you?,anger
1086,"_Mais c’est du dernier ridicule!_ What did you think, if a young man....” But the place where Levin had been stung was evidently still sore, for he turned pale again, when Stepan Arkadyevitch would have enlarged on the reason, and he himself cut him short.",anger
1087,“Please don’t go into it!,anger
1088,I can’t help it.,anger
1089,I feel ashamed of how I’m treating you and him.,sadness
1090,"But it won’t be, I imagine, a great grief to him to go, and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife.” “But it’s insulting to him!",anger
1091,_Et puis c’est ridicule_.” “And to me it’s both insulting and distressing!,anger
1092,"And I’m not at fault in any way, and there’s no need for me to suffer.” “Well, this I didn’t expect of you!",anger
1093,"_On peut être jaloux, mais à ce point, c’est du dernier ridicule!_” Levin turned quickly, and walked away from him into the depths of the avenue, and he went on walking up and down alone.",anger
1094,"Soon he heard the rumble of the trap, and saw from behind the trees how Vassenka, sitting in the hay (unluckily there was no seat in the trap) in his Scotch cap, was driven along the avenue, jolting up and down over the ruts.",anger
1095,"“What’s this?” Levin thought, when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the trap.",anger
1096,"It was the mechanician, whom Levin had totally forgotten.",sadness
1097,"The mechanician, bowing low, said something to Veslovsky, then clambered into the trap, and they drove off together.",anger
1098,Stepan Arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by Levin’s action.,anger
1099,"And he himself felt not only in the highest degree _ridicule_, but also utterly guilty and disgraced.",sadness
1100,"But remembering what sufferings he and his wife had been through, when he asked himself how he should act another time, he answered that he should do just the same again.",anger
1101,"In spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the princess, who could not pardon Levin’s action, became extraordinarily lively and good-humored, like children after a punishment or grown-up people after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening Vassenka’s dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the princess, as though it were some remote event.",joy
1102,"And Dolly, who had inherited her father’s gift of humorous storytelling, made Varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth time, always with fresh humorous additions, how she had only just put on her new shoes for the benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing-room, heard suddenly the rumble of the trap.",sadness
1103,"And who should be in the trap but Vassenka himself, with his Scotch cap, and his songs and his gaiters, and all, sitting in the hay.",sadness
1104,“If only you’d ordered out the carriage!,anger
1105,But no!,joy
1106,"and then I hear: ‘Stop!’ Oh, I thought they’ve relented.",anger
1107,"I look out, and behold a fat German being sat down by him and driving away.... And my new shoes all for nothing!...” Darya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna.",anger
1108,She was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked.,anger
1109,She quite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with Vronsky.,anger
1110,"But she felt she must go and see Anna, and show her that her feelings could not be changed, in spite of the change in her position.",joy
1111,"That she might be independent of the Levins in this expedition, Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest.",anger
1112,“What makes you suppose that I dislike your going?,anger
1113,"But, even if I did dislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my horses,” he said.",joy
1114,“You never told me that you were going for certain.,anger
1115,"Hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me, and, what’s of more importance, they’ll undertake the job and never get you there.",anger
1116,I have horses.,anger
1117,"And if you don’t want to wound me, you’ll take mine.” Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready for his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them together from the farm and saddle-horses—not at all a smart-looking set, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day.",joy
1118,"At that moment, when horses were wanted for the princess, who was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult matter for Levin to make up the number, but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house.",sadness
1119,"Moreover, he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her; Darya Alexandrovna’s pecuniary affairs, which were in a very unsatisfactory state, were taken to heart by the Levins as if they were their own.",joy
1120,"Darya Alexandrovna, by Levin’s advice, started before daybreak.",anger
1121,"The road was good, the carriage comfortable, the horses trotted along merrily, and on the box, besides the coachman, sat the counting-house clerk, whom Levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security.",joy
1122,Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed.,anger
1123,"After drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant’s with whom Levin had stayed on the way to Sviazhsky’s, and chatting with the women about their children, and with the old man about Count Vronsky, whom the latter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, at ten o’clock, went on again.",anger
1124,"At home, looking after her children, she had no time to think.",anger
1125,"So now, after this journey of four hours, all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain, and she thought over all her life as she never had before, and from the most different points of view.",anger
1126,Her thoughts seemed strange even to herself.,fear
1127,"At first she thought about the children, about whom she was uneasy, although the princess and Kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look after them.",anger
1128,"“If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if Grisha isn’t kicked by a horse, and Lily’s stomach isn’t upset again!” she thought.",anger
1129,But these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future.,joy
1130,"She began thinking how she had to get a new flat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing-room furniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak.",joy
1131,Then questions of the more remote future occurred to her: how she was to place her children in the world.,anger
1132,"“The girls are all right,” she thought; “but the boys?” “It’s very well that I’m teaching Grisha, but of course that’s only because I am free myself now, I’m not with child.",joy
1133,"Stiva, of course, there’s no counting on.",anger
1134,And with the help of good-natured friends I can bring them up; but if there’s another baby coming?...” And the thought struck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children.,sadness
1135,"“The birth itself, that’s nothing; but the months of carrying the child—that’s what’s so intolerable,” she thought, picturing to herself her last pregnancy, and the death of the last baby.",fear
1136,And she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn.,anger
1137,"On being asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully: “I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.” “Well, did you grieve very much for her?” asked Darya Alexandrovna.",joy
1138,“Why grieve?,sadness
1139,The old man has grandchildren enough as it is.,joy
1140,It was only a trouble.,anger
1141,"No working, nor nothing.",anger
1142,Only a tie.” This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could not help recalling these words.,joy
1143,In those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth.,anger
1144,"“Yes, altogether,” thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life, “pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything, and most of all—hideousness.",anger
1145,"Kitty, young and pretty as she is, even Kitty has lost her looks; and I when I’m with child become hideous, I know it.",anger
1146,"The birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment ... then the nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains....” Darya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child.",sadness
1147,"“Then the children’s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them up; evil propensities” (she thought of little Masha’s crime among the raspberries), “education, Latin—it’s all so incomprehensible and difficult.",anger
1148,"And on the top of it all, the death of these children.” And there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory, that always tore her mother’s heart, of the death of her last little baby, who had died of croup; his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the open, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.",anger
1149,"“And all this, what’s it for?",anger
1150,What is to come of it all?,anger
1151,"That I’m wasting my life, never having a moment’s peace, either with child, or nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are growing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless.",anger
1152,"Even now, if it weren’t for spending the summer at the Levins’, I don’t know how we should be managing to live.",joy
1153,Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much tact that we don’t feel it; but it can’t go on.,joy
1154,"They’ll have children, they won’t be able to keep us; it’s a drag on them as it is.",joy
1155,"How is papa, who has hardly anything left for himself, to help us?",anger
1156,"So that I can’t even bring the children up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other people, at the cost of humiliation.",sadness
1157,"Why, even if we suppose the greatest good luck, that the children don’t die, and I bring them up somehow.",joy
1158,At the very best they’ll simply be decent people.,joy
1159,That’s all I can hope for.,joy
1160,"And to gain simply that—what agonies, what toil!...",joy
1161,"One’s whole life ruined!” Again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said, and again she was revolted at the thought; but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words.",anger
1162,"“Is it far now, Mihail?” Darya Alexandrovna asked the counting-house clerk, to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her.",fear
1163,"“From this village, they say, it’s five miles.” The carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge.",anger
1164,"On the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders, gaily and noisily chattering.",joy
1165,"They stood still on the bridge, staring inquisitively at the carriage.",anger
1166,"All the faces turned to Darya Alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of their enjoyment of life.",joy
1167,"“They’re all living, they’re all enjoying life,” Darya Alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage, “while I, let out, as it were from prison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only looking about me now for an instant.",joy
1168,"They all live; those peasant women and my sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am going to see—all, but not I.",anger
1169,“And they attack Anna.,anger
1170,What for?,anger
1171,am I any better?,joy
1172,"I have, anyway, a husband I love—not as I should like to love him, still I do love him, while Anna never loved hers.",love
1173,How is she to blame?,anger
1174,She wants to live.,anger
1175,God has put that in our hearts.,joy
1176,Very likely I should have done the same.,joy
1177,Even to this day I don’t feel sure I did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow.,joy
1178,I ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh.,joy
1179,I might have loved and have been loved in reality.,love
1180,And is it any better as it is?,joy
1181,I don’t respect him.,anger
1182,"He’s necessary to me,” she thought about her husband, “and I put up with him.",anger
1183,Is that any better?,joy
1184,"At that time I could still have been admired, I had beauty left me still,” Darya Alexandrovna pursued her thoughts, and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking-glass.",anger
1185,"She had a traveling looking-glass in her handbag, and she wanted to take it out; but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying counting-house clerk, she felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round, and she did not take out the glass.",sadness
1186,"But without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not too late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always particularly attentive to her, of Stiva’s good-hearted friend, Turovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina, and was in love with her.",anger
1187,"And there was someone else, a quite young man, who—her husband had told her it as a joke—thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters.",joy
1188,And the most passionate and impossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna’s imagination.,anger
1189,"“Anna did quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her for it.",anger
1190,"She is happy, she makes another person happy, and she’s not broken down as I am, but most likely just as she always was, bright, clever, open to every impression,” thought Darya Alexandrovna,—and a sly smile curved her lips, for, as she pondered on Anna’s love affair, Darya Alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man who was in love with her.",joy
1191,"She, like Anna, confessed the whole affair to her husband.",anger
1192,And the amazement and perplexity of Stepan Arkadyevitch at this avowal made her smile.,joy
1193,In such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to Vozdvizhenskoe.,anger
1194,"The coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right, to a field of rye, where some peasants were sitting on a cart.",anger
1195,"The counting-house clerk was just going to jump down, but on second thoughts he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead, and beckoned to them to come up.",anger
1196,"The wind, that seemed to blow as they drove, dropped when the carriage stood still; gadflies settled on the steaming horses that angrily shook them off.",anger
1197,"The metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe, that came to them from the cart, ceased.",anger
1198,One of the peasants got up and came towards the carriage.,anger
1199,"“Well, you are slow!” the counting-house clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the rough dry road.",anger
1200,"“Come along, do!” A curly-headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair, and his bent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening his steps, and took hold of the mud-guard with his sunburnt hand.",anger
1201,"“Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house?",anger
1202,the count’s?” he repeated; “go on to the end of this track.,anger
1203,Then turn to the left.,anger
1204,Straight along the avenue and you’ll come right upon it.,joy
1205,But whom do you want?,anger
1206,"The count himself?” “Well, are they at home, my good man?” Darya Alexandrovna said vaguely, not knowing how to ask about Anna, even of this peasant.",joy
1207,"“At home for sure,” said the peasant, shifting from one bare foot to the other, and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust.",anger
1208,"“Sure to be at home,” he repeated, evidently eager to talk.",joy
1209,“Only yesterday visitors arrived.,joy
1210,There’s a sight of visitors come.,joy
1211,"What do you want?” He turned round and called to a lad, who was shouting something to him from the cart.",anger
1212,“Oh!,anger
1213,"They all rode by here not long since, to look at a reaping machine.",anger
1214,They’ll be home by now.,anger
1215,"And who will you be belonging to?...” “We’ve come a long way,” said the coachman, climbing onto the box.",joy
1216,"“So it’s not far?” “I tell you, it’s just here.",joy
1217,"As soon as you get out....” he said, keeping hold all the while of the carriage.",anger
1218,"A healthy-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow came up too.",joy
1219,"“What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?” he asked.",anger
1220,"“I don’t know, my boy.” “So you keep to the left, and you’ll come right on it,” said the peasant, unmistakably loth to let the travelers go, and eager to converse.",joy
1221,"The coachman started the horses, but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted: “Stop!",anger
1222,"Hi, friend!",joy
1223,Stop!” called the two voices.,anger
1224,The coachman stopped.,anger
1225,“They’re coming!,joy
1226,They’re yonder!” shouted the peasant.,anger
1227,"“See what a turn-out!” he said, pointing to four persons on horseback, and two in a _char-à-banc_, coming along the road.",anger
1228,"They were Vronsky with a jockey, Veslovsky and Anna on horseback, and Princess Varvara and Sviazhsky in the _char-à-banc_.",anger
1229,They had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine.,anger
1230,"When the carriage stopped, the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace.",anger
1231,Anna was in front beside Veslovsky.,anger
1232,"Anna, quietly walking her horse, a sturdy English cob with cropped mane and short tail, her beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat, her full shoulders, her slender waist in her black riding habit, and all the ease and grace of her deportment, impressed Dolly.",joy
1233,For the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for Anna to be on horseback.,anger
1234,"The conception of riding on horseback for a lady was, in Darya Alexandrovna’s mind, associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity, which, in her opinion, was unbecoming in Anna’s position.",joy
1235,"But when she had scrutinized her, seeing her closer, she was at once reconciled to her riding.",anger
1236,"In spite of her elegance, everything was so simple, quiet, and dignified in the attitude, the dress and the movements of Anna, that nothing could have been more natural.",joy
1237,"Beside Anna, on a hot-looking gray cavalry horse, was Vassenka Veslovsky in his Scotch cap with floating ribbons, his stout legs stretched out in front, obviously pleased with his own appearance.",joy
1238,Darya Alexandrovna could not suppress a good-humored smile as she recognized him.,joy
1239,"Behind rode Vronsky on a dark bay mare, obviously heated from galloping.",anger
1240,"He was holding her in, pulling at the reins.",anger
1241,After him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey.,anger
1242,"Sviazhsky and Princess Varvara in a new _char-à-banc_ with a big, raven-black trotting horse, overtook the party on horseback.",anger
1243,"Anna’s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when, in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage, she recognized Dolly.",joy
1244,"She uttered a cry, started in the saddle, and set her horse into a gallop.",anger
1245,"On reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance, and holding up her riding habit, she ran up to greet Dolly.",anger
1246,“I thought it was you and dared not think it.,anger
1247,How delightful!,joy
1248,"You can’t fancy how glad I am!” she said, at one moment pressing her face against Dolly and kissing her, and at the next holding her off and examining her with a smile.",joy
1249,"“Here’s a delightful surprise, Alexey!” she said, looking round at Vronsky, who had dismounted, and was walking towards them.",joy
1250,"Vronsky, taking off his tall gray hat, went up to Dolly.",anger
1251,"“You wouldn’t believe how glad we are to see you,” he said, giving peculiar significance to the words, and showing his strong white teeth in a smile.",joy
1252,"Vassenka Veslovsky, without getting off his horse, took off his cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head.",anger
1253,"“That’s Princess Varvara,” Anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from Dolly as the _char-à-banc_ drove up.",anger
1254,"“Ah!” said Darya Alexandrovna, and unconsciously her face betrayed her dissatisfaction.",sadness
1255,"Princess Varvara was her husband’s aunt, and she had long known her, and did not respect her.",anger
1256,"She knew that Princess Varvara had passed her whole life toadying on her rich relations, but that she should now be sponging on Vronsky, a man who was nothing to her, mortified Dolly on account of her kinship with her husband.",sadness
1257,"Anna noticed Dolly’s expression, and was disconcerted by it.",anger
1258,"She blushed, dropped her riding habit, and stumbled over it.",sadness
1259,Darya Alexandrovna went up to the _char-à-banc_ and coldly greeted Princess Varvara.,joy
1260,Sviazhsky too she knew.,anger
1261,"He inquired how his queer friend with the young wife was, and running his eyes over the ill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards, proposed to the ladies that they should get into the _char-à-banc_.",anger
1262,"“And I’ll get into this vehicle,” he said.",anger
1263,"“The horse is quiet, and the princess drives capitally.” “No, stay as you were,” said Anna, coming up, “and we’ll go in the carriage,” and taking Dolly’s arm, she drew her away.",anger
1264,"Darya Alexandrovna’s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she had never seen before, the splendid horses, and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her.",joy
1265,"But what struck her most of all was the change that had taken place in Anna, whom she knew so well and loved.",anger
1266,"Any other woman, a less close observer, not knowing Anna before, or not having thought as Darya Alexandrovna had been thinking on the road, would not have noticed anything special in Anna.",joy
1267,"But now Dolly was struck by that temporary beauty, which is only found in women during the moments of love, and which she saw now in Anna’s face.",sadness
1268,"Everything in her face, the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin, the line of her lips, the smile which, as it were, fluttered about her face, the brilliance of her eyes, the grace and rapidity of her movements, the fulness of the notes of her voice, even the manner in which, with a sort of angry friendliness, she answered Veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob, so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost—it was all peculiarly fascinating, and it seemed as if she were herself aware of it, and rejoicing in it.",anger
1269,"When both the women were seated in the carriage, a sudden embarrassment came over both of them.",anger
1270,Anna was disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry Dolly fixed upon her.,anger
1271,"Dolly was embarrassed because after Sviazhsky’s phrase about “this vehicle,” she could not help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which Anna was sitting with her.",sadness
1272,The coachman Philip and the counting-house clerk were experiencing the same sensation.,sadness
1273,"The counting-house clerk, to conceal his confusion, busied himself settling the ladies, but Philip the coachman became sullen, and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this external superiority.",anger
1274,"He smiled ironically, looking at the raven horse, and was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the _char-à-banc_ was only good for _promenage_, and wouldn’t do thirty miles straight off in the heat.",joy
1275,"The peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends, making their comments on it.",anger
1276,"“They’re pleased, too; haven’t seen each other for a long while,” said the curly-headed old man with the bast round his hair.",joy
1277,"“I say, Uncle Gerasim, if we could take that raven horse now, to cart the corn, that ’ud be quick work!” “Look-ee!",joy
1278,"Is that a woman in breeches?” said one of them, pointing to Vassenka Veslovsky sitting in a side saddle.",anger
1279,"“Nay, a man!",anger
1280,"See how smartly he’s going it!” “Eh, lads!",anger
1281,"seems we’re not going to sleep, then?” “What chance of sleep today!” said the old man, with a sidelong look at the sun.",joy
1282,"“Midday’s past, look-ee!",joy
1283,"Get your hooks, and come along!” Anna looked at Dolly’s thin, care-worn face, with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road, and she was on the point of saying what she was thinking, that is, that Dolly had got thinner.",anger
1284,"But, conscious that she herself had grown handsomer, and that Dolly’s eyes were telling her so, she sighed and began to speak about herself.",sadness
1285,"“You are looking at me,” she said, “and wondering how I can be happy in my position?",joy
1286,Well!,joy
1287,"it’s shameful to confess, but I ... I’m inexcusably happy.",joy
1288,"Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you’re frightened, panic-stricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more.",fear
1289,I have waked up.,anger
1290,"I have lived through the misery, the dread, and now for a long while past, especially since we’ve been here, I’ve been so happy!...” she said, with a timid smile of inquiry looking at Dolly.",fear
1291,"“How glad I am!” said Dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking more coldly than she wanted to.",joy
1292,“I’m very glad for you.,joy
1293,Why haven’t you written to me?” “Why?...,anger
1294,Because I hadn’t the courage.... You forget my position....” “To me?,anger
1295,Hadn’t the courage?,anger
1296,If you knew how I ...,anger
1297,"I look at....” Darya Alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning, but for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so.",sadness
1298,“But of that we’ll talk later.,joy
1299,"What’s this, what are all these buildings?” she asked, wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac.",joy
1300,“Quite a little town.” But Anna did not answer.,anger
1301,"“No, no!",joy
1302,"How do you look at my position, what do you think of it?” she asked.",anger
1303,"“I consider....” Darya Alexandrovna was beginning, but at that instant Vassenka Veslovsky, having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost, galloped past them, bumping heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle.",sadness
1304,"“He’s doing it, Anna Arkadyevna!” he shouted.",anger
1305,"Anna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya Alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage, and so she cut short her thought.",anger
1306,"“I don’t think anything,” she said, “but I always loved you, and if one loves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as one would like them to be....” Anna, taking her eyes off her friend’s face and dropping her eyelids (this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her before), pondered, trying to penetrate the full significance of the words.",sadness
1307,"And obviously interpreting them as she would have wished, she glanced at Dolly.",anger
1308,"“If you had any sins,” she said, “they would all be forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words.” And Dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes.",sadness
1309,She pressed Anna’s hand in silence.,anger
1310,"“Well, what are these buildings?",joy
1311,How many there are of them!” After a moment’s silence she repeated her question.,sadness
1312,"“These are the servants’ houses, barns, and stables,” answered Anna.",anger
1313,“And there the park begins.,anger
1314,"It had all gone to ruin, but Alexey had everything renewed.",anger
1315,"He is very fond of this place, and, what I never expected, he has become intensely interested in looking after it.",love
1316,But his is such a rich nature!,joy
1317,"Whatever he takes up, he does splendidly.",anger
1318,"So far from being bored by it, he works with passionate interest.",anger
1319,"He—with his temperament as I know it—he has become careful and businesslike, a first-rate manager, he positively reckons every penny in his management of the land.",joy
1320,But only in that.,anger
1321,"When it’s a question of tens of thousands, he doesn’t think of money.” She spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them—of those they love.",joy
1322,“Do you see that big building?,joy
1323,that’s the new hospital.,joy
1324,I believe it will cost over a hundred thousand; that’s his hobby just now.,joy
1325,And do you know how it all came about?,anger
1326,"The peasants asked him for some meadowland, I think it was, at a cheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused him of being miserly.",anger
1327,"Of course it was not really because of that, but everything together, he began this hospital to prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about money.",anger
1328,"_C’est une petitesse_, if you like, but I love him all the more for it.",joy
1329,And now you’ll see the house in a moment.,joy
1330,"It was his grandfather’s house, and he has had nothing changed outside.” “How beautiful!” said Dolly, looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored greens of the old trees in the garden.",joy
1331,“Isn’t it fine?,joy
1332,"And from the house, from the top, the view is wonderful.” They drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers, in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry.",joy
1333,"“Ah, they’re here already!” said Anna, looking at the saddle horses, which were just being led away from the steps.",anger
1334,"“It is a nice horse, isn’t it?",joy
1335,It’s my cob; my favorite.,joy
1336,Lead him here and bring me some sugar.,anger
1337,Where is the count?” she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out.,anger
1338,"“Ah, there he is!” she said, seeing Vronsky coming to meet her with Veslovsky.",anger
1339,"“Where are you going to put the princess?” said Vronsky in French, addressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more greeted Darya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand.",anger
1340,"“I think the big balcony room.” “Oh, no, that’s too far off!",anger
1341,"Better in the corner room, we shall see each other more.",joy
1342,"Come, let’s go up,” said Anna, as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her.",anger
1343,"“_Et vous oubliez votre devoir_,” she said to Veslovsky, who came out too on the steps.",anger
1344,"“_Pardon, j’en ai tout plein les poches_,” he answered, smiling, putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket.",joy
1345,"“_Mais vous venez trop tard_,” she said, rubbing her handkerchief on her hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar.",anger
1346,Anna turned to Dolly.,anger
1347,“You can stay some time?,joy
1348,For one day only?,anger
1349,"That’s impossible!” “I promised to be back, and the children....” said Dolly, feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage, and because she knew her face must be covered with dust.",sadness
1350,"“No, Dolly, darling!...",joy
1351,"Well, we’ll see.",joy
1352,"Come along, come along!” and Anna led Dolly to her room.",anger
1353,"That room was not the smart guest chamber Vronsky had suggested, but the one of which Anna had said that Dolly would excuse it.",joy
1354,"And this room, for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in which Dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels abroad.",sadness
1355,"“Well, darling, how happy I am!” Anna said, sitting down in her riding habit for a moment beside Dolly.",joy
1356,“Tell me about all of you.,anger
1357,"Stiva I had only a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the children.",anger
1358,"How is my favorite, Tanya?",joy
1359,"Quite a big girl, I expect?” “Yes, she’s very tall,” Darya Alexandrovna answered shortly, surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her children.",fear
1360,"“We are having a delightful stay at the Levins’,” she added.",joy
1361,"“Oh, if I had known,” said Anna, “that you do not despise me!...",anger
1362,You might have all come to us.,anger
1363,"Stiva’s an old friend and a great friend of Alexey’s, you know,” she added, and suddenly she blushed.",joy
1364,"“Yes, but we are all....” Dolly answered in confusion.",joy
1365,“But in my delight I’m talking nonsense.,joy
1366,"The one thing, darling, is that I am so glad to have you!” said Anna, kissing her again.",joy
1367,"“You haven’t told me yet how and what you think about me, and I keep wanting to know.",anger
1368,But I’m glad you will see me as I am.,joy
1369,The chief thing I shouldn’t like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything.,anger
1370,"I don’t want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself.",anger
1371,"I have the right to do that, haven’t I?",anger
1372,"But it is a big subject, and we’ll talk over everything properly later.",joy
1373,"Now I’ll go and dress and send a maid to you.” Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna, with a good housewife’s eye, scanned her room.",joy
1374,"All she had seen in entering the house and walking through it, and all she saw now in her room, gave her an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of which she had only read in English novels, but had never seen in Russia and in the country.",sadness
1375,Everything was new from the new French hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor.,joy
1376,"The bed had a spring mattress, and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the little pillows.",fear
1377,"The marble washstand, the dressing table, the little sofa, the tables, the bronze clock on the chimney piece, the window curtains, and the _portières_ were all new and expensive.",anger
1378,"The smart maid, who came in to offer her services, with her hair done up high, and a gown more fashionable than Dolly’s, was as new and expensive as the whole room.",joy
1379,"Darya Alexandrovna liked her neatness, her deferential and obliging manners, but she felt ill at ease with her.",anger
1380,She felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake for her.,sadness
1381,She was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home.,joy
1382,"At home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be needed twenty-four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard, which was a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting-out and making, and these thirty shillings had been saved.",anger
1383,"But before the maid she felt, if not exactly ashamed, at least uncomfortable.",sadness
1384,"Darya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka, whom she had known for years, walked in.",joy
1385,"The smart maid was sent for to go to her mistress, and Annushka remained with Darya Alexandrovna.",anger
1386,"Annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady’s arrival, and began to chatter away without a pause.",joy
1387,"Dolly observed that she was longing to express her opinion in regard to her mistress’s position, especially as to the love and devotion of the count to Anna Arkadyevna, but Dolly carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this.",joy
1388,“I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady’s dearer to me than anything.,anger
1389,"Well, it’s not for us to judge.",joy
1390,"And, to be sure, there seems so much love....” “Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please,” Darya Alexandrovna cut her short.",joy
1391,“Certainly.,anger
1392,"We’ve two women kept specially for washing small things, but most of the linen’s done by machinery.",anger
1393,The count goes into everything himself.,anger
1394,"Ah, what a husband!...” Dolly was glad when Anna came in, and by her entrance put a stop to Annushka’s gossip.",anger
1395,Anna had put on a very simple batiste gown.,joy
1396,Dolly scrutinized that simple gown attentively.,joy
1397,"She knew what it meant, and the price at which such simplicity was obtained.",anger
1398,"“An old friend,” said Anna of Annushka.",anger
1399,Anna was not embarrassed now.,fear
1400,She was perfectly composed and at ease.,joy
1401,"Dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her arrival had made on her, and had assumed that superficial, careless tone which, as it were, closed the door on that compartment in which her deeper feelings and ideas were kept.",sadness
1402,"“Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?” asked Dolly.",anger
1403,“Annie?” (This was what she called her little daughter Anna.),anger
1404,“Very well.,joy
1405,She has got on wonderfully.,joy
1406,Would you like to see her?,anger
1407,"Come, I’ll show her to you.",anger
1408,"We had a terrible bother,” she began telling her, “over nurses.",anger
1409,We had an Italian wet-nurse.,anger
1410,"A good creature, but so stupid!",anger
1411,"We wanted to get rid of her, but the baby is so used to her that we’ve gone on keeping her still.” “But how have you managed?...” Dolly was beginning a question as to what name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden frown on Anna’s face, she changed the drift of her question.",anger
1412,“How did you manage?,anger
1413,have you weaned her yet?” But Anna had understood.,anger
1414,“You didn’t mean to ask that?,anger
1415,You meant to ask about her surname.,anger
1416,Yes?,anger
1417,That worries Alexey.,joy
1418,"She has no name—that is, she’s a Karenina,” said Anna, dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting.",anger
1419,"“But we’ll talk about all that later,” her face suddenly brightening.",fear
1420,"“Come, I’ll show you her.",anger
1421,_Elle est très gentille_.,joy
1422,She crawls now.” In the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole house struck her still more.,surprise
1423,"There were little go-carts ordered from England, and appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table, purposely constructed for crawling, and swings and baths, all of special pattern, and modern.",joy
1424,"They were all English, solid, and of good make, and obviously very expensive.",anger
1425,"The room was large, and very light and lofty.",joy
1426,"When they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her little smock, was sitting in a little elbow chair at the table, having her dinner of broth, which she was spilling all over her little chest.",fear
1427,"The baby was being fed, and the Russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her meal.",anger
1428,"Neither the wet-nurse nor the head-nurse were there; they were in the next room, from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer French which was their only means of communication.",anger
1429,"Hearing Anna’s voice, a smart, tall, English nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door, hurriedly shaking her fair curls, and immediately began to defend herself though Anna had not found fault with her.",joy
1430,"At every word Anna said, the English nurse said hurriedly several times, “Yes, my lady.” The rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair, her sturdy red little body with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger.",joy
1431,She positively envied the baby’s healthy appearance.,joy
1432,"She was delighted, too, at the baby’s crawling.",joy
1433,Not one of her own children had crawled like that.,anger
1434,"When the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress tucked up behind, it was wonderfully charming.",joy
1435,"Looking round like some little wild animal at the grown-up big people with her bright black eyes, she smiled, unmistakably pleased at their admiring her, and holding her legs sideways, she pressed vigorously on her arms, and rapidly drew her whole back up after, and then made another step forward with her little arms.",anger
1436,"But the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the English nurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all.",joy
1437,"It was only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a household as Anna’s that Darya Alexandrovna could explain to herself how Anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing, disreputable-looking woman as nurse to her child.",anger
1438,"Besides, from a few words that were dropped, Darya Alexandrovna saw at once that Anna, the two nurses, and the child had no common existence, and that the mother’s visit was something exceptional.",joy
1439,"Anna wanted to get the baby her plaything, and could not find it.",anger
1440,"Most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the baby had, Anna answered wrong, and knew nothing about the two last teeth.",anger
1441,"“I sometimes feel sorry I’m so superfluous here,” said Anna, going out of the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape the plaything standing in the doorway.",sadness
1442,"“It was very different with my first child.” “I expected it to be the other way,” said Darya Alexandrovna shyly.",anger
1443,"“Oh, no!",joy
1444,"By the way, do you know I saw Seryozha?” said Anna, screwing up her eyes, as though looking at something far away.",anger
1445,“But we’ll talk about that later.,joy
1446,"You wouldn’t believe it, I’m like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her, and she does not know what to begin on first.",anger
1447,"The dinner is you, and the talks I have before me with you, which I could never have with anyone else; and I don’t know which subject to begin upon first.",joy
1448,_Mais je ne vous ferai grâce de rien_.,joy
1449,"I must have everything out with you.” “Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us,” she went on.",anger
1450,“I’ll begin with the ladies.,joy
1451,"Princess Varvara—you know her, and I know your opinion and Stiva’s about her.",joy
1452,"Stiva says the whole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over Auntie Katerina Pavlovna: that’s all true; but she’s a good-natured woman, and I am so grateful to her.",joy
1453,In Petersburg there was a moment when a chaperon was absolutely essential for me.,joy
1454,Then she turned up.,anger
1455,But really she is good-natured.,joy
1456,She did a great deal to alleviate my position.,joy
1457,"I see you don’t understand all the difficulty of my position ... there in Petersburg,” she added.",anger
1458,“Here I’m perfectly at ease and happy.,joy
1459,"Well, of that later on, though.",joy
1460,"Then Sviazhsky—he’s the marshal of the district, and he’s a very good sort of a man, but he wants to get something out of Alexey.",anger
1461,"You understand, with his property, now that we are settled in the country, Alexey can exercise great influence.",joy
1462,"Then there’s Tushkevitch—you have seen him, you know—Betsy’s admirer.",anger
1463,Now he’s been thrown over and he’s come to see us.,anger
1464,"As Alexey says, he’s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts them for what they try to appear to be, _et puis il est comme il faut_, as Princess Varvara says.",joy
1465,Then Veslovsky ... you know him.,anger
1466,"A very nice boy,” she said, and a sly smile curved her lips.",joy
1467,“What’s this wild story about him and the Levins?,anger
1468,"Veslovsky told Alexey about it, and we don’t believe it.",anger
1469,"_Il est très gentil et naïf_,” she said again with the same smile.",joy
1470,"“Men need occupation, and Alexey needs a circle, so I value all these people.",joy
1471,"We have to have the house lively and gay, so that Alexey may not long for any novelty.",joy
1472,"Then you’ll see the steward—a German, a very good fellow, and he understands his work.",joy
1473,Alexey has a very high opinion of him.,anger
1474,"Then the doctor, a young man, not quite a Nihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his knife ... but a very good doctor.",joy
1475,"Then the architect.... _Une petite cour!_” “Here’s Dolly for you, princess, you were so anxious to see her,” said Anna, coming out with Darya Alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where Princess Varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame, working at a cover for Count Alexey Kirillovitch’s easy chair.",joy
1476,"“She says she doesn’t want anything before dinner, but please order some lunch for her, and I’ll go and look for Alexey and bring them all in.” Princess Varvara gave Dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception, and began at once explaining to her that she was living with Anna because she had always cared more for her than her sister Katerina Pavlovna, the aunt that had brought Anna up, and that now, when everyone had abandoned Anna, she thought it her duty to help her in this most difficult period of transition.",sadness
1477,"“Her husband will give her a divorce, and then I shall go back to my solitude; but now I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, however difficult it may be for me—not like some other people.",sadness
1478,"And how sweet it is of you, how right of you to have come!",joy
1479,"They live like the best of married couples; it’s for God to judge them, not for us.",joy
1480,"And didn’t Biryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva ... and Sam Nikandrov, and Vassiliev and Madame Mamonova, and Liza Neptunova.... Did no one say anything about them?",anger
1481,And it has ended by their being received by everyone.,anger
1482,"And then, _c’est un intérieur si joli, si comme il faut.",joy
1483,Tout-à-fait à l’anglaise.,anger
1484,"On se réunit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se sépare._ Everyone does as he pleases till dinner time.",joy
1485,Dinner at seven o’clock.,anger
1486,Stiva did very rightly to send you.,anger
1487,He needs their support.,anger
1488,You know that through his mother and brother he can do anything.,anger
1489,And then they do so much good.,joy
1490,He didn’t tell you about his hospital?,anger
1491,"_Ce sera admirable_—everything from Paris.” Their conversation was interrupted by Anna, who had found the men of the party in the billiard room, and returned with them to the terrace.",anger
1492,"There was still a long time before the dinner-hour, it was exquisite weather, and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were proposed.",anger
1493,"There were very many methods of passing the time at Vozdvizhenskoe, and these were all unlike those in use at Pokrovskoe.",anger
1494,"“_Une partie de lawn-tennis,_” Veslovsky proposed, with his handsome smile.",joy
1495,"“We’ll be partners again, Anna Arkadyevna.” “No, it’s too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat, show Darya Alexandrovna the river banks.” Vronsky proposed.",anger
1496,"“I agree to anything,” said Sviazhsky.",anger
1497,“I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a stroll—wouldn’t you?,joy
1498,"And then the boat, perhaps,” said Anna.",anger
1499,So it was decided.,anger
1500,"Veslovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing place, promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them.",joy
1501,"They walked along the path in two couples, Anna with Sviazhsky, and Dolly with Vronsky.",anger
1502,Dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surroundings in which she found herself.,fear
1503,"Abstractly, theoretically, she did not merely justify, she positively approved of Anna’s conduct.",anger
1504,"As is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue, weary of the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she not only excused illicit love, she positively envied it.",joy
1505,"Besides, she loved Anna with all her heart.",love
1506,"But seeing Anna in actual life among these strangers, with this fashionable tone that was so new to Darya Alexandrovna, she felt ill at ease.",anger
1507,What she disliked particularly was seeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed.,anger
1508,"As a general principle, abstractly, Dolly approved of Anna’s action; but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was disagreeable to her.",anger
1509,"Moreover, she had never liked Vronsky.",anger
1510,"She thought him very proud, and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except his wealth.",joy
1511,"But against her own will, here in his own house, he overawed her more than ever, and she could not be at ease with him.",sadness
1512,She felt with him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her dressing jacket.,joy
1513,"Just as with the maid she had felt not exactly ashamed, but embarrassed at her darns, so she felt with him not exactly ashamed, but embarrassed at herself.",sadness
1514,"Dolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation.",anger
1515,"Even though she supposed that, through his pride, praise of his house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him, she did all the same tell him how much she liked his house.",anger
1516,"“Yes, it’s a very fine building, and in the good old-fashioned style,” he said.",joy
1517,“I like so much the court in front of the steps.,anger
1518,"Was that always so?” “Oh, no!” he said, and his face beamed with pleasure.",joy
1519,"“If you could only have seen that court last spring!” And he began, at first rather diffidently, but more and more carried away by the subject as he went on, to draw her attention to the various details of the decoration of his house and garden.",joy
1520,"It was evident that, having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home, Vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person, and was genuinely delighted at Darya Alexandrovna’s praise.",joy
1521,"“If you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired, indeed, it’s not far.",anger
1522,"Shall we go?” he said, glancing into her face to convince himself that she was not bored.",anger
1523,"“Are you coming, Anna?” he turned to her.",anger
1524,"“We will come, won’t we?” she said, addressing Sviazhsky.",anger
1525,"“_Mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre Veslovsky et Tushkevitch se morfondre là dans le bateau._ We must send and tell them.” “Yes, this is a monument he is setting up here,” said Anna, turning to Dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously talked about the hospital.",sadness
1526,"“Oh, it’s a work of real importance!” said Sviazhsky.",joy
1527,"But to show he was not trying to ingratiate himself with Vronsky, he promptly added some slightly critical remarks.",anger
1528,"“I wonder, though, count,” he said, “that while you do so much for the health of the peasants, you take so little interest in the schools.” “_C’est devenu tellement commun les écoles,_” said Vronsky.",joy
1529,"“You understand it’s not on that account, but it just happens so, my interest has been diverted elsewhere.",joy
1530,"This way then to the hospital,” he said to Darya Alexandrovna, pointing to a turning out of the avenue.",anger
1531,The ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path.,anger
1532,"After going down several turnings, and going through a little gate, Darya Alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large pretentious-looking red building, almost finished.",anger
1533,"The iron roof, which was not yet painted, shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine.",joy
1534,"Beside the finished building another had been begun, surrounded by scaffolding.",anger
1535,"Workmen in aprons, standing on scaffolds, were laying bricks, pouring mortar out of vats, and smoothing it with trowels.",anger
1536,“How quickly work gets done with you!” said Sviazhsky.,anger
1537,“When I was here last time the roof was not on.” “By the autumn it will all be ready.,joy
1538,"Inside almost everything is done,” said Anna.",joy
1539,"“And what’s this new building?” “That’s the house for the doctor and the dispensary,” answered Vronsky, seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him; and excusing himself to the ladies, he went to meet him.",anger
1540,"Going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime, he stood still with the architect and began talking rather warmly.",joy
1541,"“The front is still too low,” he said to Anna, who had asked what was the matter.",anger
1542,"“I said the foundation ought to be raised,” said Anna.",anger
1543,"“Yes, of course it would have been much better, Anna Arkadyevna,” said the architect, “but now it’s too late.” “Yes, I take a great interest in it,” Anna answered Sviazhsky, who was expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture.",joy
1544,“This new building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital.,joy
1545,"It was an afterthought, and was begun without a plan.” Vronsky, having finished his talk with the architect, joined the ladies, and led them inside the hospital.",anger
1546,"Although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were painting on the ground floor, upstairs almost all the rooms were finished.",joy
1547,"Going up the broad cast-iron staircase to the landing, they walked into the first large room.",anger
1548,"The walls were stuccoed to look like marble, the huge plate-glass windows were already in, only the parquet floor was not yet finished, and the carpenters, who were planing a block of it, left their work, taking off the bands that fastened their hair, to greet the gentry.",anger
1549,"“This is the reception room,” said Vronsky.",joy
1550,"“Here there will be a desk, tables, and benches, and nothing more.” “This way; let us go in here.",joy
1551,"Don’t go near the window,” said Anna, trying the paint to see if it were dry.",anger
1552,"“Alexey, the paint’s dry already,” she added.",anger
1553,From the reception room they went into the corridor.,anger
1554,Here Vronsky showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system.,anger
1555,"Then he showed them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs.",joy
1556,"Then he showed them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room, then the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors, and many other things.",anger
1557,"Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements, appreciated everything fully.",joy
1558,"Dolly simply wondered at all she had not seen before, and, anxious to understand it all, made minute inquiries about everything, which gave Vronsky great satisfaction.",joy
1559,"“Yes, I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fitted hospital in Russia,” said Sviazhsky.",anger
1560,“And won’t you have a lying-in ward?” asked Dolly.,anger
1561,“That’s so much needed in the country.,anger
1562,"I have often....” In spite of his usual courtesy, Vronsky interrupted her.",anger
1563,"“This is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the sick, and is intended for all diseases, except infectious complaints,” he said.",anger
1564,“Ah!,anger
1565,"look at this,” and he rolled up to Darya Alexandrovna an invalid chair that had just been ordered for the convalescents.",anger
1566,“Look.” He sat down in the chair and began moving it.,anger
1567,"“The patient can’t walk—still too weak, perhaps, or something wrong with his legs, but he must have air, and he moves, rolls himself along....” Darya Alexandrovna was interested by everything.",anger
1568,"She liked everything very much, but most of all she liked Vronsky himself with his natural, simple-hearted eagerness.",anger
1569,"“Yes, he’s a very nice, good man,” she thought several times, not hearing what he said, but looking at him and penetrating into his expression, while she mentally put herself in Anna’s place.",joy
1570,She liked him so much just now with his eager interest that she saw how Anna could be in love with him.,joy
1571,"“No, I think the princess is tired, and horses don’t interest her,” Vronsky said to Anna, who wanted to go on to the stables, where Sviazhsky wished to see the new stallion.",anger
1572,"“You go on, while I escort the princess home, and we’ll have a little talk,” he said, “if you would like that?” he added, turning to her.",anger
1573,"“I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted,” answered Darya Alexandrovna, rather astonished.",joy
1574,She saw by Vronsky’s face that he wanted something from her.,anger
1575,She was not mistaken.,anger
1576,"As soon as they had passed through the little gate back into the garden, he looked in the direction Anna had taken, and having made sure that she could neither hear nor see them, he began: “You guess that I have something I want to say to you,” he said, looking at her with laughing eyes.",joy
1577,"“I am not wrong in believing you to be a friend of Anna’s.” He took off his hat, and taking out his handkerchief, wiped his head, which was growing bald.",anger
1578,"Darya Alexandrovna made no answer, and merely stared at him with dismay.",anger
1579,"When she was left alone with him, she suddenly felt afraid; his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her.",fear
1580,The most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to her flashed into her brain.,anger
1581,"“He is going to beg me to come to stay with them with the children, and I shall have to refuse; or to create a set that will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn’t it Vassenka Veslovsky and his relations with Anna?",sadness
1582,"Or perhaps about Kitty, that he feels he was to blame?” All her conjectures were unpleasant, but she did not guess what he really wanted to talk about to her.",sadness
1583,"“You have so much influence with Anna, she is so fond of you,” he said; “do help me.” Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face, which under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again.",joy
1584,"She waited for him to say more, but he walked in silence beside her, scratching with his cane in the gravel.",anger
1585,"“You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna’s former friends—I don’t count Princess Varvara—but I know that you have done this not because you regard our position as normal, but because, understanding all the difficulty of the position, you still love her and want to be a help to her.",sadness
1586,"Have I understood you rightly?” he asked, looking round at her.",anger
1587,"“Oh, yes,” answered Darya Alexandrovna, putting down her sunshade, “but....” “No,” he broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the awkward position into which he was putting his companion, he stopped abruptly, so that she had to stop short too.",anger
1588,"“No one feels more deeply and intensely than I do all the difficulty of Anna’s position; and that you may well understand, if you do me the honor of supposing I have any heart.",sadness
1589,"I am to blame for that position, and that is why I feel it.” “I understand,” said Darya Alexandrovna, involuntarily admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he said this.",love
1590,"“But just because you feel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am afraid,” she said.",joy
1591,"“Her position in the world is difficult, I can well understand.” “In the world it is hell!” he brought out quickly, frowning darkly.",anger
1592,"“You can’t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through in Petersburg in that fortnight ... and I beg you to believe it.” “Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna ... nor you miss society....” “Society!” he said contemptuously, “how could I miss society?” “So far—and it may be so always—you are happy and at peace.",joy
1593,"I see in Anna that she is happy, perfectly happy, she has had time to tell me so much already,” said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling; and involuntarily, as she said this, at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether Anna really were happy.",joy
1594,"But Vronsky, it appeared, had no doubts on that score.",joy
1595,"“Yes, yes,” he said, “I know that she has revived after all her sufferings; she is happy.",joy
1596,She is happy in the present.,joy
1597,But I?...,anger
1598,I am afraid of what is before us ...,fear
1599,"I beg your pardon, you would like to walk on?” “No, I don’t mind.” “Well, then, let us sit here.” Darya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue.",joy
1600,He stood up facing her.,anger
1601,"“I see that she is happy,” he repeated, and the doubt whether she were happy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna’s mind.",joy
1602,“But can it last?,anger
1603,"Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question, but the die is cast,” he said, passing from Russian to French, “and we are bound together for life.",anger
1604,We are united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred.,joy
1605,"We have a child, we may have other children.",anger
1606,But the law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she does not see and does not want to see.,joy
1607,And that one can well understand.,joy
1608,But I can’t help seeing them.,anger
1609,"My daughter is by law not my daughter, but Karenin’s.",anger
1610,"I cannot bear this falsity!” he said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and he looked with gloomy inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.",anger
1611,"She made no answer, but simply gazed at him.",anger
1612,"He went on: “One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a Karenin; he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have, there will be no real tie between us.",joy
1613,They will be Karenins.,anger
1614,You can understand the bitterness and horror of this position!,sadness
1615,I have tried to speak of this to Anna.,anger
1616,It irritates her.,anger
1617,"She does not understand, and to her I cannot speak plainly of all this.",anger
1618,Now look at another side.,joy
1619,"I am happy, happy in her love, but I must have occupation.",joy
1620,"I have found occupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army.",joy
1621,And most certainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs.,anger
1622,"I am working here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented, and we need nothing more to make us happy.",joy
1623,I love my work here.,joy
1624,"_Ce n’est pas un pis-aller,_ on the contrary....” Darya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew confused, and she did not quite understand this digression, but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart, of which he could not speak to Anna, he was now making a clean breast of everything, and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same category of matters near his heart, as the question of his relations with Anna.",sadness
1625,"“Well, I will go on,” he said, collecting himself.",anger
1626,"“The great thing is that as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will not die with me, that I shall have heirs to come after me,—and this I have not.",joy
1627,"Conceive the position of a man who knows that his children, the children of the woman he loves, will not be his, but will belong to someone who hates them and cares nothing about them!",sadness
1628,"It is awful!” He paused, evidently much moved.",anger
1629,"“Yes, indeed, I see that.",joy
1630,But what can Anna do?” queried Darya Alexandrovna.,anger
1631,"“Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,” he said, calming himself with an effort.",joy
1632,"“Anna can, it depends on her....",anger
1633,"Even to petition the Tsar for legitimization, a divorce is essential.",anger
1634,And that depends on Anna.,anger
1635,Her husband agreed to a divorce—at that time your husband had arranged it completely.,anger
1636,"And now, I know, he would not refuse it.",anger
1637,It is only a matter of writing to him.,anger
1638,"He said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire, he would not refuse.",anger
1639,"Of course,” he said gloomily, “it is one of those Pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men are capable.",anger
1640,"He knows what agony any recollection of him must give her, and knowing her, he must have a letter from her.",sadness
1641,I can understand that it is agony to her.,sadness
1642,"But the matter is of such importance, that one must _passer par-dessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment.",joy
1643,"Il y va du bonheur et de l’existence d’Anne et de ses enfants._ I won’t speak of myself, though it’s hard for me, very hard,” he said, with an expression as though he were threatening someone for its being hard for him.",anger
1644,"“And so it is, princess, that I am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation.",joy
1645,"Help me to persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.” “Yes, of course,” Darya Alexandrovna said dreamily, as she vividly recalled her last interview with Alexey Alexandrovitch.",fear
1646,"“Yes, of course,” she repeated with decision, thinking of Anna.",anger
1647,"“Use your influence with her, make her write.",anger
1648,"I don’t like—I’m almost unable to speak about this to her.” “Very well, I will talk to her.",anger
1649,"But how is it she does not think of it herself?” said Darya Alexandrovna, and for some reason she suddenly at that point recalled Anna’s strange new habit of half-closing her eyes.",fear
1650,And she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon.,anger
1651,"“Just as though she half-shut her eyes to her own life, so as not to see everything,” thought Dolly.",joy
1652,"“Yes, indeed, for my own sake and for hers I will talk to her,” Dolly said in reply to his look of gratitude.",joy
1653,They got up and walked to the house.,anger
1654,"When Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her eyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had had with Vronsky, but she made no inquiry in words.",anger
1655,"“I believe it’s dinner time,” she said.",anger
1656,“We’ve not seen each other at all yet.,anger
1657,I am reckoning on the evening.,joy
1658,Now I want to go and dress.,anger
1659,I expect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.” Dolly went to her room and she felt amused.,joy
1660,"To change her dress was impossible, for she had already put on her best dress.",anger
1661,"But in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to brush her dress, changed her cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her head.",anger
1662,"“This is all I can do,” she said with a smile to Anna, who came in to her in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.",anger
1663,"“Yes, we are too formal here,” she said, as it were apologizing for her magnificence.",anger
1664,"“Alexey is delighted at your visit, as he rarely is at anything.",joy
1665,"He has completely lost his heart to you,” she added.",sadness
1666,“You’re not tired?” There was no time for talking about anything before dinner.,anger
1667,"Going into the drawing-room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats.",joy
1668,The architect wore a swallow-tail coat.,anger
1669,Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest.,anger
1670,The architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.,anger
1671,"A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies got up.",joy
1672,"Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself offered his arm to Dolly.",anger
1673,"Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering his arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevitch with the steward and the doctor walked in alone.",anger
1674,"The dinner, the dining-room, the service, the waiting at table, the wine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous and modern.",joy
1675,"Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household—although she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household, as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living—she could not help scrutinizing every detail, and wondering how and by whom it was all done.",joy
1676,"Vassenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviazhsky, and many other people she knew, would never have considered this question, and would have readily believed what every well-bred host tries to make his guests feel, that is, that all that is well-ordered in his house has cost him, the host, no trouble whatever, but comes of itself.",joy
1677,"Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the children’s breakfast does not come of itself, and that therefore, where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained, someone must give earnest attention to its organization.",joy
1678,"And from the glance with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned the table, from the way he nodded to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup, she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself.",anger
1679,It was evident that it all rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky.,joy
1680,"She, Sviazhsky, the princess, and Veslovsky, were equally guests, with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them.",joy
1681,Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation.,anger
1682,"The conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present, like the steward and the architect, belonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation.",sadness
1683,"But this difficult conversation Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness, and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna observed.",joy
1684,"The conversation began about the row Tushkevitch and Veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevitch began describing the last boat races in Petersburg at the Yacht Club.",anger
1685,"But Anna, seizing the first pause, at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence.",anger
1686,"“Nikolay Ivanitch was struck,” she said, meaning Sviazhsky, “at the progress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.” “It’s first-rate working with his excellency,” said the architect with a smile (he was respectful and composed, though with a sense of his own dignity).",joy
1687,“It’s a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities.,anger
1688,"Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here I call upon the count, and in three words we settle the business.” “The American way of doing business,” said Sviazhsky, with a smile.",joy
1689,"“Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....” The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United States, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to draw the steward into talk.",anger
1690,"“Have you ever seen a reaping machine?” she said, addressing Darya Alexandrovna.",anger
1691,“We had just ridden over to look at one when we met.,anger
1692,It’s the first time I ever saw one.” “How do they work?” asked Dolly.,anger
1693,“Exactly like little scissors.,anger
1694,A plank and a lot of little scissors.,anger
1695,"Like this.” Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings, and began showing how the machine worked.",joy
1696,It was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.,joy
1697,"“More like little penknives,” Veslovsky said playfully, never taking his eyes off her.",anger
1698,"Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer.",joy
1699,"“Isn’t it true, Karl Fedoritch, that it’s just like little scissors?” she said to the steward.",anger
1700,"“_Oh, ja,_” answered the German.",anger
1701,"_“Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding,”_ and he began to explain the construction of the machine.",anger
1702,“It’s a pity it doesn’t bind too.,anger
1703,"I saw one at the Vienna exhibition, which binds with a wire,” said Sviazhsky.",anger
1704,"“They would be more profitable in use.” _“Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.”_ And the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to Vronsky.",anger
1705,"_“Das lässt sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.”_ The German was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in, but recollecting that he was at a dinner, and observing Vronsky’s chilly glance, he checked himself.",joy
1706,"_“Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot,”_ he concluded.",joy
1707,"_“Wünscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots,”_ said Vassenka Veslovsky, mimicking the German.",anger
1708,"_“J’adore l’allemand,”_ he addressed Anna again with the same smile.",joy
1709,"_“Cessez,”_ she said with playful severity.",joy
1710,"“We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch,” she said to the doctor, a sickly-looking man; “have you been there?” “I went there, but I had taken flight,” the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness.",sadness
1711,"“Then you’ve taken a good constitutional?” “Splendid!” “Well, and how was the old woman?",anger
1712,"I hope it’s not typhus?” “Typhus it is not, but it’s taking a bad turn.” “What a pity!” said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.",sadness
1713,"“It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your description, Anna Arkadyevna,” Sviazhsky said jestingly.",anger
1714,"“Oh, no, why so?” said Anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by Sviazhsky.",joy
1715,This new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on Dolly.,sadness
1716,"“But Anna Arkadyevna’s knowledge of architecture is marvelous,” said Tushkevitch.",joy
1717,"“To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and damp-courses,” said Veslovsky.",joy
1718,"“Have I got it right?” “There’s nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of it,” said Anna.",joy
1719,"“But, I dare say, you don’t even know what houses are made of?” Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that existed between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her will.",anger
1720,Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin.,anger
1721,"He obviously attached no significance to Veslovsky’s chattering; on the contrary, he encouraged his jests.",anger
1722,"“Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?” “By cement, of course.” “Bravo!",anger
1723,"And what is cement?” “Oh, some sort of paste ... no, putty,” said Veslovsky, raising a general laugh.",anger
1724,"The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect, and the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a conversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on another, and at times stinging one or the other to the quick.",anger
1725,"Once Darya Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant.",anger
1726,"Sviazhsky began talking of Levin, describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on Russian agriculture.",fear
1727,"“I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,” Vronsky said, smiling, “but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns; or if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer fashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad.",joy
1728,"What sort of views can anyone have on such a subject?” “Turkish views, in general,” Veslovsky said, turning to Anna with a smile.",joy
1729,"“I can’t defend his opinions,” Darya Alexandrovna said, firing up; “but I can say that he’s a highly cultivated man, and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of doing so.” “I like him extremely, and we are great friends,” Sviazhsky said, smiling good-naturedly.",joy
1730,"“_Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toqué;_ he maintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration boards are all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in anything.” “It’s our Russian apathy,” said Vronsky, pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; “we’ve no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize these duties.” “I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties,” said Darya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky’s tone of superiority.",anger
1731,"“For my part,” pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation, “such as I am, I am, on the contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks to Nikolay Ivanitch” (he indicated Sviazhsky), “in electing me a justice of the peace.",anger
1732,"I consider that for me the duty of being present at the session, of judging some peasants’ quarrel about a horse, is as important as anything I can do.",joy
1733,And I shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council.,joy
1734,It’s only in that way I can pay for the advantages I enjoy as a landowner.,joy
1735,Unluckily they don’t understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the state.” It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table.,joy
1736,"She thought how Levin, who believed the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own table.",joy
1737,"But she loved Levin, and so she was on his side.",anger
1738,"“So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?” said Sviazhsky.",anger
1739,"“But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on the spot by the eighth.",joy
1740,"If you would do me the honor to stop with me.” “I rather agree with your _beau-frère_,” said Anna, “though not quite on the same ground as he,” she added with a smile.",joy
1741,“I’m afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days.,anger
1742,"Just as in old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone’s doing some sort of public duty.",joy
1743,"Alexey has been here now six months, and he’s a member, I do believe, of five or six different public bodies.",joy
1744,"_Du train que cela va,_ the whole time will be wasted on it.",sadness
1745,"And I’m afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they’ll end in being a mere form.",fear
1746,"How many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch?” she turned to Sviazhsky—“over twenty, I fancy.” Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone.",anger
1747,"Darya Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it instantly.",joy
1748,"She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky’s face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression.",anger
1749,"Noticing this, and that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of Petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country, Dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.",anger
1750,"The dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good; but it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it all had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her.",sadness
1751,"After dinner they sat on the terrace, then they proceeded to play lawn tennis.",anger
1752,"The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet-ground.",anger
1753,"Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play, but it was a long time before she could understand the game, and by the time she did understand it, she was so tired that she sat down with Princess Varvara and simply looked on at the players.",anger
1754,"Her partner, Tushkevitch, gave up playing too, but the others kept the game up for a long time.",anger
1755,Sviazhsky and Vronsky both played very well and seriously.,anger
1756,"They kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them, and without haste or getting in each other’s way, they ran adroitly up to them, waited for the rebound, and neatly and accurately returned them over the net.",joy
1757,Veslovsky played worse than the others.,anger
1758,"He was too eager, but he kept the players lively with his high spirits.",joy
1759,His laughter and outcries never paused.,anger
1760,"Like the other men of the party, with the ladies’ permission, he took off his coat, and his solid, comely figure in his white shirt-sleeves, with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements, made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory.",sadness
1761,"When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she closed her eyes, she saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet ground.",fear
1762,During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself.,joy
1763,"She did not like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time between Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness altogether of grown-up people, all alone without children, playing at a child’s game.",sadness
1764,"But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow, after a rest she joined the game again, and pretended to be enjoying it.",joy
1765,"All that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she, and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance.",anger
1766,"She had come with the intention of staying two days, if all went well.",joy
1767,"But in the evening, during the game, she made up her mind that she would go home next day.",joy
1768,"The maternal cares and worries, which she had so hated on the way, now, after a day spent without them, struck her in quite another light, and tempted her back to them.",anger
1769,"When, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya Alexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began arranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.",sadness
1770,It was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna was coming to see her immediately.,anger
1771,She longed to be alone with her own thoughts.,sadness
1772,"Dolly was wanting to go to bed when Anna came in to see her, attired for the night.",anger
1773,"In the course of the day Anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her heart, and every time after a few words she had stopped: “Afterwards, by ourselves, we’ll talk about everything.",joy
1774,"I’ve got so much I want to tell you,” she said.",anger
1775,"Now they were by themselves, and Anna did not know what to talk about.",anger
1776,"She sat in the window looking at Dolly, and going over in her own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand, and she found nothing.",joy
1777,At that moment it seemed to her that everything had been said already.,joy
1778,"“Well, what of Kitty?” she said with a heavy sigh, looking penitently at Dolly.",anger
1779,"“Tell me the truth, Dolly: isn’t she angry with me?” “Angry?",anger
1780,"Oh, no!” said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling.",joy
1781,"“But she hates me, despises me?” “Oh, no!",anger
1782,"But you know that sort of thing isn’t forgiven.” “Yes, yes,” said Anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.",anger
1783,“But I was not to blame.,anger
1784,And who is to blame?,anger
1785,What’s the meaning of being to blame?,anger
1786,Could it have been otherwise?,anger
1787,What do you think?,joy
1788,"Could it possibly have happened that you didn’t become the wife of Stiva?” “Really, I don’t know.",anger
1789,"But this is what I want you to tell me....” “Yes, yes, but we’ve not finished about Kitty.",joy
1790,Is she happy?,joy
1791,"He’s a very nice man, they say.” “He’s much more than very nice.",joy
1792,"I don’t know a better man.” “Ah, how glad I am!",joy
1793,I’m so glad!,joy
1794,"Much more than very nice,” she repeated.",joy
1795,Dolly smiled.,joy
1796,“But tell me about yourself.,joy
1797,We’ve a great deal to talk about.,joy
1798,And I’ve had a talk with....” Dolly did not know what to call him.,anger
1799,She felt it awkward to call him either the count or Alexey Kirillovitch.,sadness
1800,"“With Alexey,” said Anna, “I know what you talked about.",anger
1801,"But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?” “How am I to say like that straight off?",anger
1802,"I really don’t know.” “No, tell me all the same.... You see my life.",anger
1803,"But you mustn’t forget that you’re seeing us in the summer, when you have come to us and we are not alone....",sadness
1804,"But we came here early in the spring, lived quite alone, and shall be alone again, and I desire nothing better.",joy
1805,"But imagine me living alone without him, alone, and that will be ...",anger
1806,"I see by everything that it will often be repeated, that he will be half the time away from home,” she said, getting up and sitting down close by Dolly.",anger
1807,"“Of course,” she interrupted Dolly, who would have answered, “of course I won’t try to keep him by force.",anger
1808,I don’t keep him indeed.,anger
1809,"The races are just coming, his horses are running, he will go.",anger
1810,I’m very glad.,joy
1811,"But think of me, fancy my position....",joy
1812,But what’s the use of talking about it?” She smiled.,joy
1813,"“Well, what did he talk about with you?” “He spoke of what I want to speak about of myself, and it’s easy for me to be his advocate; of whether there is not a possibility ... whether you could not....” (Darya Alexandrovna hesitated) “correct, improve your position.... You know how I look at it....",joy
1814,"But all the same, if possible, you should get married....” “Divorce, you mean?” said Anna.",anger
1815,"“Do you know, the only woman who came to see me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya?",anger
1816,"You know her, of course?",anger
1817,"_Au fond, c’est la femme la plus depravée qui existe._ She had an intrigue with Tushkevitch, deceiving her husband in the basest way.",love
1818,And she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular.,anger
1819,Don’t imagine I would compare ...,anger
1820,"I know you, darling.",anger
1821,"But I could not help remembering.... Well, so what did he say to you?” she repeated.",anger
1822,“He said that he was unhappy on your account and his own.,anger
1823,"Perhaps you will say that it’s egoism, but what a legitimate and noble egoism.",joy
1824,"He wants first of all to legitimize his daughter, and to be your husband, to have a legal right to you.” “What wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as I, in my position?” she put in gloomily.",sadness
1825,“The chief thing he desires ... he desires that you should not suffer.” “That’s impossible.,sadness
1826,"Well?” “Well, and the most legitimate desire—he wishes that your children should have a name.” “What children?” Anna said, not looking at Dolly, and half closing her eyes.",joy
1827,"“Annie and those to come....” “He need not trouble on that score; I shall have no more children.” “How can you tell that you won’t?” “I shall not, because I don’t wish it.” And, in spite of all her emotion, Anna smiled, as she caught the naïve expression of curiosity, wonder, and horror on Dolly’s face.",joy
1828,"“The doctor told me after my illness....” “Impossible!” said Dolly, opening her eyes wide.",joy
1829,"For her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in, and that one will have to reflect a great, great deal upon it.",sadness
1830,"This discovery, suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children, which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her, aroused so many ideas, reflections, and contradictory emotions, that she had nothing to say, and simply gazed with wide-open eyes of wonder at Anna.",joy
1831,"This was the very thing she had been dreaming of, but now learning that it was possible, she was horrified.",anger
1832,She felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem.,joy
1833,"_“N’est-ce pas immoral?”_ was all she said, after a brief pause.",joy
1834,“Why so?,anger
1835,"Think, I have a choice between two alternatives: either to be with child, that is an invalid, or to be the friend and companion of my husband—practically my husband,” Anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous.",sadness
1836,"“Yes, yes,” said Darya Alexandrovna, hearing the very arguments she had used to herself, and not finding the same force in them as before.",anger
1837,"“For you, for other people,” said Anna, as though divining her thoughts, “there may be reason to hesitate; but for me.... You must consider, I am not his wife; he loves me as long as he loves me.",joy
1838,And how am I to keep his love?,anger
1839,"Not like this!” She moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with extraordinary rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement; ideas and memories rushed into Darya Alexandrovna’s head.",anger
1840,"“I,” she thought, “did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he left me for others, and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively.",joy
1841,He deserted her and took another.,sadness
1842,And can Anna attract and keep Count Vronsky in that way?,joy
1843,"If that is what he looks for, he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming.",joy
1844,"And however white and beautiful her bare arms are, however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls, he will find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and charming husband does.” Dolly made no answer, she merely sighed.",joy
1845,"Anna noticed this sigh, indicating dissent, and she went on.",anger
1846,In her armory she had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.,anger
1847,“Do you say that it’s not right?,joy
1848,"But you must consider,” she went on; “you forget my position.",anger
1849,How can I desire children?,joy
1850,"I’m not speaking of the suffering, I’m not afraid of that.",fear
1851,"Think only, what are my children to be?",anger
1852,"Ill-fated children, who will have to bear a stranger’s name.",anger
1853,"For the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother, their father, their birth.” “But that is just why a divorce is necessary.” But Anna did not hear her.",sadness
1854,She longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she had so many times convinced herself.,anger
1855,"“What is reason given me for, if I am not to use it to avoid bringing unhappy beings into the world!” She looked at Dolly, but without waiting for a reply she went on: “I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children,” she said.",anger
1856,"“If they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy; while if they are unhappy, I alone should be to blame for it.” These were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her own reflections; but she heard them without understanding them.",sadness
1857,“How can one wrong creatures that don’t exist?” she thought.,anger
1858,"And all at once the idea struck her: could it possibly, under any circumstances, have been better for her favorite Grisha if he had never existed?",joy
1859,"And this seemed to her so wild, so strange, that she shook her head to drive away this tangle of whirling, mad ideas.",anger
1860,"“No, I don’t know; it’s not right,” was all she said, with an expression of disgust on her face.",sadness
1861,"“Yes, but you mustn’t forget that you and I.... And besides that,” added Anna, in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of Dolly’s objections, seeming still to admit that it was not right, “don’t forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position as you.",joy
1862,For you the question is: do you desire not to have any more children; while for me it is: do I desire to have them?,joy
1863,And that’s a great difference.,joy
1864,You must see that I can’t desire it in my position.” Darya Alexandrovna made no reply.,anger
1865,"She suddenly felt that she had got far away from Anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions on which they could never agree, and about which it was better not to speak.",joy
1866,"“Then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position, if possible,” said Dolly.",joy
1867,"“Yes, if possible,” said Anna, speaking all at once in an utterly different tone, subdued and mournful.",sadness
1868,“Surely you don’t mean a divorce is impossible?,anger
1869,"I was told your husband had consented to it.” “Dolly, I don’t want to talk about that.” “Oh, we won’t then,” Darya Alexandrovna hastened to say, noticing the expression of suffering on Anna’s face.",sadness
1870,“All I see is that you take too gloomy a view of things.” “I?,sadness
1871,Not at all!,anger
1872,I’m always bright and happy.,joy
1873,"You see, _je fais des passions._ Veslovsky....” “Yes, to tell the truth, I don’t like Veslovsky’s tone,” said Darya Alexandrovna, anxious to change the subject.",fear
1874,"“Oh, that’s nonsense!",anger
1875,"It amuses Alexey, and that’s all; but he’s a boy, and quite under my control.",anger
1876,"You know, I turn him as I please.",anger
1877,It’s just as it might be with your Grisha.... Dolly!”—she suddenly changed the subject—“you say I take too gloomy a view of things.,sadness
1878,You can’t understand.,anger
1879,It’s too awful!,sadness
1880,I try not to take any view of it at all.” “But I think you ought to.,anger
1881,You ought to do all you can.” “But what can I do?,anger
1882,Nothing.,joy
1883,"You tell me to marry Alexey, and say I don’t think about it.",anger
1884,"I don’t think about it!” she repeated, and a flush rose into her face.",sadness
1885,"She got up, straightening her chest, and sighed heavily.",anger
1886,"With her light step she began pacing up and down the room, stopping now and then.",anger
1887,“I don’t think of it?,anger
1888,"Not a day, not an hour passes that I don’t think of it, and blame myself for thinking of it ... because thinking of that may drive me mad.",anger
1889,Drive me mad!” she repeated.,anger
1890,"“When I think of it, I can’t sleep without morphine.",anger
1891,But never mind.,joy
1892,Let us talk quietly.,joy
1893,"They tell me, divorce.",anger
1894,"In the first place, he won’t give me a divorce.",anger
1895,"He’s under the influence of Countess Lidia Ivanovna now.” Darya Alexandrovna, sitting erect on a chair, turned her head, following Anna with a face of sympathetic suffering.",sadness
1896,"“You ought to make the attempt,” she said softly.",anger
1897,“Suppose I make the attempt.,anger
1898,"What does it mean?” she said, evidently giving utterance to a thought, a thousand times thought over and learned by heart.",joy
1899,"“It means that I, hating him, but still recognizing that I have wronged him—and I consider him magnanimous—that I humiliate myself to write to him.... Well, suppose I make the effort; I do it.",anger
1900,"Either I receive a humiliating refusal or consent.... Well, I have received his consent, say....” Anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the room, and she stopped there, doing something to the curtain at the window.",anger
1901,"“I receive his consent, but my ... my son?",anger
1902,They won’t give him up to me.,anger
1903,"He will grow up despising me, with his father, whom I’ve abandoned.",sadness
1904,"Do you see, I love ... equally, I think, but both more than myself—two creatures, Seryozha and Alexey.” She came out into the middle of the room and stood facing Dolly, with her arms pressed tightly across her chest.",fear
1905,In her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad.,joy
1906,"She bent her head, and with shining, wet eyes looked from under her brows at Dolly, a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap, shaking all over with emotion.",sadness
1907,"“It is only those two creatures that I love, and one excludes the other.",anger
1908,"I can’t have them together, and that’s the only thing I want.",anger
1909,"And since I can’t have that, I don’t care about the rest.",anger
1910,"I don’t care about anything, anything.",anger
1911,"And it will end one way or another, and so I can’t, I don’t like to talk of it.",anger
1912,"So don’t blame me, don’t judge me for anything.",anger
1913,"You can’t with your pure heart understand all that I’m suffering.” She went up, sat down beside Dolly, and with a guilty look, peeped into her face and took her hand.",sadness
1914,“What are you thinking?,joy
1915,What are you thinking about me?,anger
1916,Don’t despise me.,anger
1917,I don’t deserve contempt.,anger
1918,I’m simply unhappy.,sadness
1919,"If anyone is unhappy, I am,” she articulated, and turning away, she burst into tears.",sadness
1920,"Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed.",anger
1921,"She had felt for Anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her, but now she could not force herself to think of her.",sadness
1922,"The memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her, with a sort of new brilliance.",joy
1923,"That world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it, and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back next day.",joy
1924,"Anna meantime went back to her boudoir, took a wine-glass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine, of which the principal ingredient was morphine.",anger
1925,"After drinking it off and sitting still a little while, she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.",joy
1926,"When she went into the bedroom, Vronsky looked intently at her.",anger
1927,"He was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew that, staying so long in Dolly’s room, she must have had with her.",anger
1928,"But in her expression of restrained excitement, and of a sort of reserve, he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it, the consciousness of it, and the desire that it should affect him.",sadness
1929,"He did not want to ask her what they had been talking of, but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord.",joy
1930,But she only said: “I am so glad you like Dolly.,joy
1931,"You do, don’t you?” “Oh, I’ve known her a long while, you know.",anger
1932,"She’s very good-hearted, I suppose, _mais excessivement terre-à-terre._ Still, I’m very glad to see her.” He took Anna’s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes.",joy
1933,"Misinterpreting the look, she smiled to him.",anger
1934,"Next morning, in spite of the protests of her hosts, Darya Alexandrovna prepared for her homeward journey.",anger
1935,"Levin’s coachman, in his by no means new coat and shabby hat, with his ill-matched horses and his coach with the patched mud-guards, drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach.",anger
1936,Darya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the gentlemen of the party.,anger
1937,"After a day spent together, both she and her hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together, and that it was better for them not to meet.",joy
1938,Only Anna was sad.,sadness
1939,"She knew that now, from Dolly’s departure, no one again would stir up within her soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation.",anger
1940,"It hurt her to stir up these feelings, but yet she knew that that was the best part of her soul, and that that part of her soul would quickly be smothered in the life she was leading.",joy
1941,"As she drove out into the open country, Darya Alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief, and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at Vronsky’s, when suddenly the coachman, Philip, expressed himself unasked: “Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all they gave us.",anger
1942,Everything cleared up till there wasn’t a grain left by cockcrow.,anger
1943,What are three pots?,anger
1944,A mere mouthful!,joy
1945,And oats now down to forty-five kopecks.,anger
1946,"At our place, no fear, all comers may have as much as they can eat.” “The master’s a screw,” put in the counting-house clerk.",anger
1947,"“Well, did you like their horses?” asked Dolly.",anger
1948,“The horses!—there’s no two opinions about them.,anger
1949,And the food was good.,joy
1950,"But it seemed to me sort of dreary there, Darya Alexandrovna.",sadness
1951,"I don’t know what you thought,” he said, turning his handsome, good-natured face to her.",joy
1952,“I thought so too.,anger
1953,"Well, shall we get home by evening?” “Eh, we must!” On reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and particularly charming, Darya Alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them how she had arrived, how warmly they had received her, of the luxury and good taste in which the Vronskys lived, and of their recreations, and she would not allow a word to be said against them.",joy
1954,"“One has to know Anna and Vronsky—I have got to know him better now—to see how nice they are, and how touching,” she said, speaking now with perfect sincerity, and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there.",joy
1955,"Vronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the country, living in just the same condition, and still taking no steps to obtain a divorce.",sadness
1956,"It was an understood thing between them that they should not go away anywhere; but both felt, the longer they lived alone, especially in the autumn, without guests in the house, that they could not stand this existence, and that they would have to alter it.",sadness
1957,Their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired.,joy
1958,"They had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child, and both had occupation.",anger
1959,"Anna devoted just as much care to her appearance when they had no visitors, and she did a great deal of reading, both of novels and of what serious literature was in fashion.",joy
1960,"She ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she received, and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion.",anger
1961,"Moreover, every subject that was of interest to Vronsky, she studied in books and special journals, so that he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture, sometimes even with questions relating to horse-breeding or sport.",anger
1962,"He was amazed at her knowledge, her memory, and at first was disposed to doubt it, to ask for confirmation of her facts; and she would find what he asked for in some book, and show it to him.",surprise
1963,"The building of the hospital, too, interested her.",anger
1964,"She did not merely assist, but planned and suggested a great deal herself.",joy
1965,"But her chief thought was still of herself—how far she was dear to Vronsky, how far she could make up to him for all he had given up.",anger
1966,"Vronsky appreciated this desire not only to please, but to serve him, which had become the sole aim of her existence, but at the same time he wearied of the loving snares in which she tried to hold him fast.",anger
1967,"As time went on, and he saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares, he had an ever growing desire, not so much to escape from them, as to try whether they hindered his freedom.",sadness
1968,"Had it not been for this growing desire to be free, not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the town to a meeting or a race, Vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his life.",joy
1969,"The rôle he had taken up, the rôle of a wealthy landowner, one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the Russian aristocracy, was entirely to his taste; and now, after spending six months in that character, he derived even greater satisfaction from it.",joy
1970,"And his management of his estate, which occupied and absorbed him more and more, was most successful.",joy
1971,"In spite of the immense sums cost him by the hospital, by machinery, by cows ordered from Switzerland, and many other things, he was convinced that he was not wasting, but increasing his substance.",anger
1972,"In all matters affecting income, the sales of timber, wheat, and wool, the letting of lands, Vronsky was hard as a rock, and knew well how to keep up prices.",anger
1973,"In all operations on a large scale on this and his other estates, he kept to the simplest methods involving no risk, and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an extreme degree.",anger
1974,"In spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the German steward, who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his original estimate always far larger than really required, and then representing to Vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper, and so make a profit, Vronsky did not give in.",joy
1975,"He listened to his steward, cross-examined him, and only agreed to his suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest, not yet known in Russia, and likely to excite wonder.",joy
1976,"Apart from such exceptions, he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a surplus, and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest details, and insisted on getting the very best for his money; so that by the method on which he managed his affairs, it was clear that he was not wasting, but increasing his substance.",anger
1977,"In October there were the provincial elections in the Kashinsky province, where were the estates of Vronsky, Sviazhsky, Koznishev, Oblonsky, and a small part of Levin’s land.",anger
1978,"These elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them, and also from the people taking part in them.",anger
1979,"There had been a great deal of talk about them, and great preparations were being made for them.",joy
1980,"Persons who never attended the elections were coming from Moscow, from Petersburg, and from abroad to attend these.",anger
1981,Vronsky had long before promised Sviazhsky to go to them.,anger
1982,"Before the elections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, drove over to fetch Vronsky.",anger
1983,On the day before there had been almost a quarrel between Vronsky and Anna over this proposed expedition.,anger
1984,"It was the very dullest autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and so, preparing himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold expression, informed Anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before.",sadness
1985,"But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with great composure, and merely asked when he would be back.",anger
1986,"He looked intently at her, at a loss to explain this composure.",anger
1987,She smiled at his look.,joy
1988,"He knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself, and knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know her plans.",anger
1989,"He was afraid of this; but he was so anxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances, and half sincerely believed in what he longed to believe in—her reasonableness.",fear
1990,"“I hope you won’t be dull?” “I hope not,” said Anna.",sadness
1991,“I got a box of books yesterday from Gautier’s.,anger
1992,"No, I shan’t be dull.” “She’s trying to take that tone, and so much the better,” he thought, “or else it would be the same thing over and over again.” And he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid explanation.",joy
1993,It was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation.,anger
1994,"From one point of view this troubled him, but on the other side he felt that it was better so.",joy
1995,"“At first there will be, as this time, something undefined kept back, and then she will get used to it.",anger
1996,"In any case I can give up anything for her, but not my masculine independence,” he thought.",anger
1997,In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty’s confinement.,anger
1998,"He had spent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergey Ivanovitch, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections, made ready to set off to the elections.",anger
1999,"He invited his brother, who had a vote in the Seleznevsky district, to come with him.",anger
2000,"Levin had, moreover, to transact in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister, who was abroad.",anger
2001,"Levin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bored in Moscow, and urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him the proper nobleman’s uniform, costing seven pounds.",anger
2002,And that seven pounds paid for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to go.,anger
2003,"He went to Kashin.... Levin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and busily engaged about his sister’s business, which still dragged on.",anger
2004,"The district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections, and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship.",anger
2005,"The other matter, the payment of the sums due, was met too by difficulties.",anger
2006,"After long negotiations over the legal details, the money was at last ready to be paid; but the notary, a most obliging person, could not hand over the order, because it must have the signature of the president, and the president, though he had not given over his duties to a deputy, was at the elections.",anger
2007,"All these worrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, and talking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw the unpleasantness of the petitioner’s position, but were powerless to assist him—all these efforts that yielded no result, led to a feeling of misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force.",sadness
2008,He felt this frequently as he talked to his most good-natured solicitor.,joy
2009,"This solicitor did, it seemed, everything possible, and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties.",anger
2010,"“I tell you what you might try,” he said more than once; “go to so-and-so and so-and-so,” and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything.",anger
2011,"But he would add immediately, “It’ll mean some delay, anyway, but you might try it.” And Levin did try, and did go.",anger
2012,"Everyone was kind and civil, but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end, and again to bar the way.",anger
2013,"What was particularly trying, was that Levin could not make out with whom he was struggling, to whose interest it was that his business should not be done.",anger
2014,That no one seemed to know; the solicitor certainly did not know.,anger
2015,"If Levin could have understood why, just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file, it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him.",anger
2016,"But with the hindrances that confronted him in his business, no one could explain why they existed.",anger
2017,"But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient, and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this, he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it, and that most likely it must be so, and he tried not to fret.",anger
2018,"In attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he tried now not to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected.",joy
2019,"Since his marriage there had been revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that had previously, through his frivolous attitude to them, seemed of no importance, that in the question of the elections too he assumed and tried to find some serious significance.",anger
2020,Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the proposed revolution at the elections.,anger
2021,"The marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions—the guardianship of wards (the very department which was giving Levin so much trouble just now), the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province, the high schools, female, male, and military, and popular instruction on the new model, and finally, the district council—the marshal of the province, Snetkov, was a nobleman of the old school,—dissipating an immense fortune, a good-hearted man, honest after his own fashion, but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days.",sadness
2022,"He always took, in every question, the side of the nobility; he was positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education, and he succeeded in giving a purely party character to the district council which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance.",joy
2023,"What was needed was to put in his place a fresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary ideas, and to frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles, not as the nobility, but as an element of the district council, to extract all the powers of self-government that could possibly be derived from them.",joy
2024,"In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which always took the lead of other provinces in everything, there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy, once carried through properly there, might serve as a model for other provinces for all Russia.",anger
2025,And hence the whole question was of the greatest importance.,anger
2026,"It was proposed to elect as marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky, or, better still, Nevyedovsky, a former university professor, a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
2027,"The meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to the nobles, urging them to elect the public functionaries, not from regard for persons, but for the service and welfare of their fatherland, and hoping that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would, as at all former elections, hold their duty as sacred, and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch.",joy
2028,"When he had finished with his speech, the governor walked out of the hall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly—some even enthusiastically—followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.",anger
2029,"Levin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood there too in the crowd, and heard the governor say: “Please tell Marya Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn’t come to the Home.” And thereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral.",anger
2030,"In the cathedral Levin, lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the words of the archdeacon, swore with most terrible oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do.",anger
2031,"Church services always affected Levin, and as he uttered the words “I kiss the cross,” and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same, he felt touched.",sadness
2032,"On the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the female high school, of no importance whatever, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained, and Levin, busy seeing after his own affairs, did not attend the meetings.",joy
2033,On the fourth day the auditing of the marshal’s accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province.,anger
2034,And then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old.,anger
2035,The committee who had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order.,anger
2036,"The marshal of the province got up, thanked the nobility for their confidence, and shed tears.",sadness
2037,"The nobles gave him a loud welcome, and shook hands with him.",anger
2038,"But at that instant a nobleman of Sergey Ivanovitch’s party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts, considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province.",anger
2039,One of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this.,anger
2040,"Then a small gentleman, very young-looking but very malignant, began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys, and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction.",joy
2041,"Then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission, and Sergey Ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not, and he developed this dilemma in detail.",joy
2042,Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite party.,anger
2043,"Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then the malignant gentleman again.",anger
2044,The discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing.,anger
2045,"Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long, especially as, when he asked Sergey Ivanovitch whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated, Sergey Ivanovitch answered: “Oh, no!",anger
2046,He’s an honest man.,joy
2047,But those old-fashioned methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs must be broken down.” On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals.,anger
2048,It was rather a stormy day in several districts.,anger
2049,"In the Seleznevsky district Sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, and he gave a dinner that evening.",joy
2050,The sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province.,anger
2051,"The rooms, large and small, were full of noblemen in all sorts of uniforms.",anger
2052,Many had come only for that day.,anger
2053,"Men who had not seen each other for years, some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, some from abroad, met in the rooms of the Hall of Nobility.",anger
2054,There was much discussion around the governor’s table under the portrait of the Tsar.,anger
2055,"The nobles, both in the larger and the smaller rooms, grouped themselves in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances, from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group, and from the way that some, whispering together, retreated to the farther corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets from the other.",anger
2056,In appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes: the old and the new.,anger
2057,"The old were for the most part either in old uniforms of the nobility, buttoned up closely, with spurs and hats, or in their own special naval, cavalry, infantry, or official uniforms.",joy
2058,"The uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way with epaulets on their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and short in the waist, as though their wearers had grown out of them.",anger
2059,"The younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace.",anger
2060,To the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd.,anger
2061,But the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties.,anger
2062,"Some of the young men, as Levin observed, belonged to the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, on the contrary, were whispering with Sviazhsky, and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party.",anger
2063,"Levin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and taking light refreshments, close to his own friends, and listening to what they were saying, he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence trying to understand what was said.",anger
2064,Sergey Ivanovitch was the center round which the others grouped themselves.,anger
2065,"He was listening at that moment to Sviazhsky and Hliustov, the marshal of another district, who belonged to their party.",anger
2066,"Hliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask Snetkov to stand, while Sviazhsky was persuading him to do so, and Sergey Ivanovitch was approving of the plan.",anger
2067,Levin could not make out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they wanted to supersede.,anger
2068,"Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just been drinking and taking some lunch, came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber, wiping his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste.",anger
2069,"“We are placing our forces,” he said, pulling out his whiskers, “Sergey Ivanovitch!” And listening to the conversation, he supported Sviazhsky’s contention.",anger
2070,"“One district’s enough, and Sviazhsky’s obviously of the opposition,” he said, words evidently intelligible to all except Levin.",anger
2071,"“Why, Kostya, you here too!",anger
2072,"I suppose you’re converted, eh?” he added, turning to Levin and drawing his arm through his.",anger
2073,"Levin would have been glad indeed to be converted, but could not make out what the point was, and retreating a few steps from the speakers, he explained to Stepan Arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be asked to stand.",anger
2074,"_“O sancta simplicitas!”_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and briefly and clearly he explained it to Levin.",anger
2075,"If, as at previous elections, all the districts asked the marshal of the province to stand, then he would be elected without a ballot.",anger
2076,That must not be.,anger
2077,"Now eight districts had agreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline to stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their party, which would throw them completely out in their reckoning.",anger
2078,"But if only one district, Sviazhsky’s, did not call upon him to stand, Snetkov would let himself be balloted for.",anger
2079,"They were even, some of them, going to vote for him, and purposely to let him get a good many votes, so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of the other side was put up, they too might give him some votes.",sadness
2080,"Levin understood to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more questions, when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and they moved towards the big room.",anger
2081,“What is it?,anger
2082,eh?,joy
2083,whom?” “No guarantee?,joy
2084,whose?,anger
2085,"what?” “They won’t pass him?” “No guarantee?” “They won’t let Flerov in?” “Eh, because of the charge against him?” “Why, at this rate, they won’t admit anyone.",anger
2086,"It’s a swindle!” “The law!” Levin heard exclamations on all sides, and he moved into the big room together with the others, all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something.",fear
2087,"Squeezed by the crowding noblemen, he drew near the high table where the marshal of the province, Sviazhsky, and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something.",anger
2088,Levin was standing rather far off.,anger
2089,"A nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side, and another whose thick boots were creaking, prevented him from hearing distinctly.",fear
2090,"He could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky.",anger
2091,"They were disputing, as far as he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words: “liable to be called up for trial.” The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the table.",anger
2092,"Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act.",anger
2093,"The act said that in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.",anger
2094,"Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at that point a tall, stout, round-shouldered landowner, with dyed whiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted him.",anger
2095,"He went up to the table, and striking it with his finger ring, he shouted loudly: “A ballot!",anger
2096,Put it to the vote!,anger
2097,"No need for more talking!” Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more and more loudly.",anger
2098,But it was impossible to make out what he said.,anger
2099,"He was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but it was evident that he hated him and all his party, and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly form, on the other side.",sadness
2100,"Shouts were raised, and for a moment all was confusion, so that the marshal of the province had to call for order.",anger
2101,“A ballot!,anger
2102,A ballot!,anger
2103,Every nobleman sees it!,joy
2104,We shed our blood for our country!...,anger
2105,The confidence of the monarch.... No checking the accounts of the marshal; he’s not a cashier....,anger
2106,But that’s not the point....,anger
2107,"Votes, please!",anger
2108,Beastly!...” shouted furious and violent voices on all sides.,anger
2109,Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words.,anger
2110,They expressed the most implacable hatred.,anger
2111,"Levin did not in the least understand what was the matter, and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov should be put to the vote.",sadness
2112,"He forgot, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him afterwards, this syllogism: that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov’s right to vote; that to secure the recognition of Flerov’s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act.",joy
2113,"“And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life,” concluded Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
2114,"But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.",joy
2115,To escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar.,sadness
2116,"Seeing the waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine-glasses, seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air.",joy
2117,"He began walking up and down, looking with pleasure at the waiters.",joy
2118,"He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter, who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly.",anger
2119,"Levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter, when the secretary of the court of wardship, a little old man whose specialty it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic, drew him away.",anger
2120,"“Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” he said, “your brother’s looking for you.",anger
2121,"They are voting on the legal point.” Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it.",anger
2122,"Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped.",anger
2123,"Levin advanced, but utterly forgetting what he was to do, and much embarrassed, he turned to Sergey Ivanovitch with the question, “Where am I to put it?” He asked this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near, so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard.",anger
2124,"But the persons speaking paused, and his improper question was overheard.",anger
2125,Sergey Ivanovitch frowned.,anger
2126,"“That is a matter for each man’s own decision,” he said severely.",anger
2127,Several people smiled.,joy
2128,"Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand.",anger
2129,"Having put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too, and so he thrust it in though too late, and, still more overcome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.",joy
2130,“A hundred and twenty-six for admission!,joy
2131,"Ninety-eight against!” sang out the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter _r_.",anger
2132,Then there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box.,anger
2133,"The nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party had conquered.",anger
2134,But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.,anger
2135,"Levin heard that they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something.",anger
2136,Levin went nearer.,anger
2137,"In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service.",joy
2138,"Several times he repeated the words: “I have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you,” and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out of the room.",anger
2139,"Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain of the position he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies, his emotion infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin felt a tenderness for Snetkov.",love
2140,In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.,anger
2141,"“Beg pardon, excuse me, please,” he said as to a stranger, but recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly.",joy
2142,"It seemed to Levin that he would have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion.",sadness
2143,"His face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white trousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case.",anger
2144,"This expression in the marshal’s face was particularly touching to Levin, because, only the day before, he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur, a kind-hearted, fatherly man.",sadness
2145,"The big house with the old family furniture; the rather dirty, far from stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife in a cap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her daughter’s daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy, coming home from school, and greeting his father, kissing his big hand; the genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old man—all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in Levin.",sadness
2146,"This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he longed to say something pleasant to him.",joy
2147,"“So you’re sure to be our marshal again,” he said.",anger
2148,"“It’s not likely,” said the marshal, looking round with a scared expression.",fear
2149,"“I’m worn out, I’m old.",sadness
2150,"If there are men younger and more deserving than I, let them serve.” And the marshal disappeared through a side door.",anger
2151,The most solemn moment was at hand.,anger
2152,They were to proceed immediately to the election.,anger
2153,The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers.,anger
2154,"The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov’s vote, but had also gained time for them, so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party.",anger
2155,"Two noble gentlemen, who had a weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of Snetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.",anger
2156,"On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting.",anger
2157,"“I’ve brought one, drenched him with water,” said the landowner, who had gone on this errand, to Sviazhsky.",anger
2158,“He’s all right?,anger
2159,"he’ll do.” “Not too drunk, he won’t fall down?” said Sviazhsky, shaking his head.",anger
2160,"“No, he’s first-rate.",joy
2161,"If only they don’t give him any more here.... I’ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any account.” The narrow room, in which they were smoking and taking refreshments, was full of noblemen.",anger
2162,"The excitement grew more intense, and every face betrayed some uneasiness.",fear
2163,"The excitement was specially keen for the leaders of each party, who knew every detail, and had reckoned up every vote.",joy
2164,They were the generals organizing the approaching battle.,anger
2165,"The rest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were getting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the interval.",joy
2166,"Some were lunching, standing at the bar, or sitting at the table; others were walking up and down the long room, smoking cigarettes, and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long while.",anger
2167,"Levin did not care to eat, and he was not smoking; he did not want to join his own friends, that is Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, Sviazhsky and the rest, because Vronsky in his equerry’s uniform was standing with them in eager conversation.",joy
2168,"Levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day, and he had studiously avoided him, not caring to greet him.",anger
2169,"He went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups, and listening to what was being said around him.",anger
2170,"He felt depressed, especially because everyone else was, as he saw, eager, anxious, and interested, and he alone, with an old, toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform, sitting beside him, had no interest in it and nothing to do.",sadness
2171,“He’s such a blackguard!,anger
2172,"I have told him so, but it makes no difference.",joy
2173,Only think of it!,anger
2174,"He couldn’t collect it in three years!” he heard vigorously uttered by a round-shouldered, short, country gentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar, and new boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke.",anger
2175,"Casting a displeased glance at Levin, this gentleman sharply turned his back.",anger
2176,"“Yes, it’s a dirty business, there’s no denying,” a small gentleman assented in a high voice.",anger
2177,"Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general, hurriedly came near Levin.",anger
2178,These persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard.,anger
2179,“How dare he say I had his breeches stolen!,anger
2180,"Pawned them for drink, I expect.",anger
2181,"Damn the fellow, prince indeed!",anger
2182,"He’d better not say it, the beast!” “But excuse me!",anger
2183,"They take their stand on the act,” was being said in another group; “the wife must be registered as noble.” “Oh, damn your acts!",anger
2184,I speak from my heart.,anger
2185,"We’re all gentlemen, aren’t we?",joy
2186,"Above suspicion.” “Shall we go on, your excellency, _fine champagne?_” Another group was following a nobleman, who was shouting something in a loud voice; it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen.",anger
2187,"“I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she can never save a profit,” he heard a pleasant voice say.",joy
2188,"The speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff-officer.",joy
2189,It was the very landowner Levin had met at Sviazhsky’s.,anger
2190,He knew him at once.,anger
2191,"The landowner too stared at Levin, and they exchanged greetings.",anger
2192,“Very glad to see you!,joy
2193,To be sure!,joy
2194,I remember you very well.,joy
2195,"Last year at our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch’s.” “Well, and how is your land doing?” asked Levin.",anger
2196,"“Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,” the landowner answered with a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be.",joy
2197,“And how do you come to be in our province?” he asked.,anger
2198,"“Come to take part in our _coup d’état?_” he said, confidently pronouncing the French words with a bad accent.",anger
2199,"“All Russia’s here—gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the ministry.” He pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch in white trousers and his court uniform, walking by with a general.",anger
2200,"“I ought to own that I don’t very well understand the drift of the provincial elections,” said Levin.",anger
2201,The landowner looked at him.,anger
2202,"“Why, what is there to understand?",anger
2203,There’s no meaning in it at all.,anger
2204,It’s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia.,anger
2205,"Just look, the very uniforms tell you that it’s an assembly of justices of the peace, permanent members of the court, and so on, but not of noblemen.” “Then why do you come?” asked Levin.",anger
2206,"“From habit, nothing else.",joy
2207,"Then, too, one must keep up connections.",anger
2208,It’s a moral obligation of a sort.,joy
2209,"And then, to tell the truth, there’s one’s own interests.",anger
2210,"My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent member; they’re not rich people, and he must be brought forward.",joy
2211,"These gentlemen, now, what do they come for?” he said, pointing to the malignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.",anger
2212,"“That’s the new generation of nobility.” “New it may be, but nobility it isn’t.",joy
2213,"They’re proprietors of a sort, but we’re the landowners.",anger
2214,"As noblemen, they’re cutting their own throats.” “But you say it’s an institution that’s served its time.” “That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully.",anger
2215,"Snetkov, now.... We may be of use, or we may not, but we’re the growth of a thousand years.",joy
2216,"If we’re laying out a garden, planning one before the house, you know, and there you’ve a tree that’s stood for centuries in the very spot.... Old and gnarled it may be, and yet you don’t cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds, but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree.",joy
2217,"You won’t grow him again in a year,” he said cautiously, and he immediately changed the conversation.",anger
2218,"“Well, and how is your land doing?” “Oh, not very well.",joy
2219,"I make five per cent.” “Yes, but you don’t reckon your own work.",anger
2220,Aren’t you worth something too?,joy
2221,I’ll tell you my own case.,anger
2222,"Before I took to seeing after the land, I had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service.",anger
2223,"Now I do more work than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent.",joy
2224,"on the land, and thank God for that.",anger
2225,"But one’s work is thrown in for nothing.” “Then why do you do it, if it’s a clear loss?” “Oh, well, one does it!",joy
2226,What would you have?,anger
2227,"It’s habit, and one knows it’s how it should be.",joy
2228,"And what’s more,” the landowner went on, leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on, “my son, I must tell you, has no taste for it.",joy
2229,There’s no doubt he’ll be a scientific man.,joy
2230,So there’ll be no one to keep it up.,anger
2231,And yet one does it.,joy
2232,"Here this year I’ve planted an orchard.” “Yes, yes,” said Levin, “that’s perfectly true.",joy
2233,"I always feel there’s no real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet one does it.... It’s a sort of duty one feels to the land.” “But I tell you what,” the landowner pursued; “a neighbor of mine, a merchant, was at my place.",joy
2234,We walked about the fields and the garden.,joy
2235,"‘No,’ said he, ‘Stepan Vassilievitch, everything’s well looked after, but your garden’s neglected.’ But, as a fact, it’s well kept up.",anger
2236,"‘To my thinking, I’d cut down that lime-tree.",anger
2237,"Here you’ve thousands of limes, and each would make two good bundles of bark.",joy
2238,And nowadays that bark’s worth something.,joy
2239,"I’d cut down the lot.’” “And with what he made he’d increase his stock, or buy some land for a trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants,” Levin added, smiling.",joy
2240,He had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations.,joy
2241,“And he’d make his fortune.,joy
2242,"But you and I must thank God if we keep what we’ve got and leave it to our children.” “You’re married, I’ve heard?” said the landowner.",anger
2243,"“Yes,” Levin answered, with proud satisfaction.",joy
2244,"“Yes, it’s rather strange,” he went on.",fear
2245,"“So we live without making anything, as though we were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.” The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.",anger
2246,"“There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or Count Vronsky, that’s settled here lately, who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it.” “But why is it we don’t do like the merchants?",sadness
2247,"Why don’t we cut down our parks for timber?” said Levin, returning to a thought that had struck him.",anger
2248,"“Why, as you said, to keep the fire in.",anger
2249,Besides that’s not work for a nobleman.,anger
2250,"And our work as noblemen isn’t done here at the elections, but yonder, each in our corner.",anger
2251,"There’s a class instinct, too, of what one ought and oughtn’t to do.",joy
2252,"There’s the peasants, too, I wonder at them sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he can.",anger
2253,"However bad the land is, he’ll work it.",anger
2254,Without a return too.,anger
2255,"At a simple loss.” “Just as we do,” said Levin.",joy
2256,"“Very, very glad to have met you,” he added, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.",joy
2257,"“And here we’ve met for the first time since we met at your place,” said the landowner to Sviazhsky, “and we’ve had a good talk too.” “Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?” said Sviazhsky with a smile.",joy
2258,"“That we’re bound to do.” “You’ve relieved your feelings?” Sviazhsky took Levin’s arm, and went with him to his own friends.",joy
2259,This time there was no avoiding Vronsky.,anger
2260,"He was standing with Stepan Arkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch, and looking straight at Levin as he drew near.",anger
2261,“Delighted!,anger
2262,"I believe I’ve had the pleasure of meeting you ... at Princess Shtcherbatskaya’s,” he said, giving Levin his hand.",joy
2263,"“Yes, I quite remember our meeting,” said Levin, and blushing crimson, he turned away immediately, and began talking to his brother.",anger
2264,"With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with Levin.",anger
2265,"But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually looking round at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him to gloss over his rudeness.",anger
2266,"“What are we waiting for now?” asked Levin, looking at Sviazhsky and Vronsky.",anger
2267,“For Snetkov.,anger
2268,"He has to refuse or to consent to stand,” answered Sviazhsky.",anger
2269,"“Well, and what has he done, consented or not?” “That’s the point, that he’s done neither,” said Vronsky.",anger
2270,"“And if he refuses, who will stand then?” asked Levin, looking at Vronsky.",anger
2271,"“Whoever chooses to,” said Sviazhsky.",anger
2272,“Shall you?” asked Levin.,anger
2273,"“Certainly not I,” said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and turning an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing beside Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
2274,“Who then?,anger
2275,"Nevyedovsky?” said Levin, feeling he was putting his foot into it.",sadness
2276,But this was worse still.,anger
2277,Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two candidates.,anger
2278,"“I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,” answered the malignant gentleman.",anger
2279,This was Nevyedovsky himself.,anger
2280,Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin.,anger
2281,"“Well, you find it exciting too?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, winking at Vronsky.",joy
2282,“It’s something like a race.,anger
2283,"One might bet on it.” “Yes, it is keenly exciting,” said Vronsky.",joy
2284,"“And once taking the thing up, one’s eager to see it through.",joy
2285,"It’s a fight!” he said, scowling and setting his powerful jaws.",anger
2286,“What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is!,joy
2287,"Sees it all so clearly.” “Oh, yes!” Vronsky assented indifferently.",joy
2288,"A silence followed, during which Vronsky—since he had to look at something—looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at his face, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order to say something: “How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a justice of the peace?",sadness
2289,"You are not in the uniform of one.” “It’s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly institution,” Levin answered gloomily.",anger
2290,"He had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting.",joy
2291,"“I don’t think so, quite the contrary,” Vronsky said, with quiet surprise.",joy
2292,"“It’s a plaything,” Levin cut him short.",anger
2293,“We don’t want justices of the peace.,anger
2294,I’ve never had a single thing to do with them during eight years.,anger
2295,And what I have had was decided wrongly by them.,anger
2296,The justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me.,anger
2297,"For some matter of two roubles I should have to send a lawyer, who costs me fifteen.” And he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller, and when the miller told him of it, had lodged a complaint for slander.",anger
2298,"All this was utterly uncalled for and stupid, and Levin felt it himself as he said it.",anger
2299,"“Oh, this is such an original fellow!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with his most soothing, almond-oil smile.",joy
2300,“But come along; I think they’re voting....” And they separated.,sadness
2301,"“I can’t understand,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, who had observed his brother’s clumsiness, “I can’t understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact.",sadness
2302,That’s where we Russians are so deficient.,joy
2303,"The marshal of the province is our opponent, and with him you’re _ami cochon_, and you beg him to stand.",anger
2304,"Count Vronsky, now ... I’m not making a friend of him; he’s asked me to dinner, and I’m not going; but he’s one of our side—why make an enemy of him?",anger
2305,Then you ask Nevyedovsky if he’s going to stand.,anger
2306,"That’s not a thing to do.” “Oh, I don’t understand it at all!",anger
2307,"And it’s all such nonsense,” Levin answered gloomily.",anger
2308,"“You say it’s all such nonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do with it, you make a muddle.” Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room.",anger
2309,"The marshal of the province, though he was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him, and though he had not been called upon by all to stand, had still made up his mind to stand.",joy
2310,All was silence in the room.,anger
2311,"The secretary announced in a loud voice that the captain of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be balloted for as marshal of the province.",anger
2312,"The district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were balls, from their tables to the high table, and the election began.",anger
2313,"“Put it in the right side,” whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch, as with his brother Levin followed the marshal of his district to the table.",anger
2314,"But Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to him, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying “the right side.” Surely Snetkov was the enemy.",anger
2315,"As he went up, he held the ball in his right hand, but thinking he was wrong, just at the box he changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left.",anger
2316,"An adept in the business, standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball, scowled with annoyance.",anger
2317,It was no good for him to use his insight.,joy
2318,"Everything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard.",anger
2319,Then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against.,anger
2320,The marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority.,anger
2321,All was noise and eager movement towards the doors.,joy
2322,"Snetkov came in, and the nobles thronged round him, congratulating him.",anger
2323,"“Well, now is it over?” Levin asked Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
2324,"“It’s only just beginning,” Sviazhsky said, replying for Sergey Ivanovitch with a smile.",joy
2325,“Some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal.” Levin had quite forgotten about that.,sadness
2326,"Now he could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it, but he was too bored to think what it was exactly.",anger
2327,"He felt depressed, and longed to get out of the crowd.",sadness
2328,"As no one was paying any attention to him, and no one apparently needed him, he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were, and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters.",sadness
2329,"The little old waiter pressed him to have something, and Levin agreed.",anger
2330,"After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to the hall, where it was all so distasteful to him, proceeded to walk through the galleries.",anger
2331,"The galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies, leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below.",anger
2332,"With the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers, high school teachers in spectacles, and officers.",joy
2333,"Everywhere they were talking of the election, and of how worried the marshal was, and how splendid the discussions had been.",joy
2334,In one group Levin heard his brother’s praises.,joy
2335,One lady was telling a lawyer: “How glad I am I heard Koznishev!,joy
2336,It’s worth losing one’s dinner.,joy
2337,He’s exquisite!,anger
2338,So clear and distinct all of it!,joy
2339,There’s not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that.,anger
2340,"The only one is Meidel, and he’s not so eloquent by a long way.” Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening.",joy
2341,All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts.,anger
2342,"In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform, who shouted in a loud, high voice: “As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!” A dead silence followed, and then a weak old voice was heard: “Declined!” “We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol,” the voice began again.",fear
2343,“Declined!” a high boyish voice replied.,anger
2344,"Again it began, and again “Declined.” And so it went on for about an hour.",anger
2345,"Levin, with his elbows on the balustrade, looked and listened.",anger
2346,At first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored.,joy
2347,"Then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces, he felt sad; he made up his mind to go, and went downstairs.",sadness
2348,As he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with tired-looking eyes.,sadness
2349,On the stairs he met a couple—a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor.,anger
2350,"“I told you you weren’t late,” the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass.",anger
2351,"Levin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling in his waistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat, when the secretary overtook him.",sadness
2352,"“This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are voting.” The candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky, who had so stoutly denied all idea of standing.",anger
2353,Levin went up to the door of the room; it was locked.,anger
2354,"The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin was met by two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out.",anger
2355,"“I can’t stand any more of it,” said one red-faced gentleman.",anger
2356,After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out.,anger
2357,His face was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.,sadness
2358,“I told you not to let anyone out!” he cried to the doorkeeper.,anger
2359,"“I let someone in, your excellency!” “Mercy on us!” and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room, his legs staggering in his white trousers.",sadness
2360,"Nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, and he was the new marshal of the province.",anger
2361,"Many people were amused, many were pleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were disgusted and unhappy.",anger
2362,"The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair, which he could not conceal.",sadness
2363,"When Nevyedovsky went out of the room, the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically, just as they had followed the governor who had opened the meetings, and just as they had followed Snetkov when he was elected.",anger
2364,The newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that day with Vronsky.,joy
2365,"Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the country and wanted to show Anna his right to independence, and also to repay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he had taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner which he had taken upon himself.",anger
2366,"But he had not in the least expected that the election would so interest him, so keenly excite him, and that he would be so good at this kind of thing.",joy
2367,"He was quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province, but his success was unmistakable, and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already obtained a certain influence.",anger
2368,"This influence was due to his wealth and reputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend Shirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought from the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a schoolfellow of Vronsky’s—a schoolfellow he had patronized and protected indeed.",joy
2369,"But what contributed more than all to his success was his direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness.",joy
2370,"He was himself conscious that, except that whimsical gentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had _à propos de bottes_ poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury, every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his adherent.",anger
2371,"He saw clearly, and other people recognized it, too, that he had done a great deal to secure the success of Nevyedovsky.",joy
2372,"And now at his own table, celebrating Nevyedovsky’s election, he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate.",joy
2373,"The election itself had so fascinated him that, if he could succeed in getting married during the next three years, he began to think of standing himself—much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey, he had longed to ride a race himself.",anger
2374,Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey.,joy
2375,"Vronsky sat at the head of the table, on his right hand sat the young governor, a general of high rank.",anger
2376,"To all the rest he was the chief man in the province, who had solemnly opened the elections with his speech, and aroused a feeling of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to Vronsky he was little Katka Maslov—that had been his nickname in the Pages’ Corps—whom he felt to be shy and tried to _mettre à son aise_.",fear
2377,"On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful, stubborn, and malignant face.",anger
2378,With him Vronsky was simple and deferential.,anger
2379,Sviazhsky took his failure very light-heartedly.,anger
2380,"It was indeed no failure in his eyes, as he said himself, turning, glass in hand, to Nevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the new movement, which the nobility ought to follow.",anger
2381,"And so every honest person, as he said, was on the side of today’s success and was rejoicing over it.",joy
2382,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he was having a good time, and that everyone was pleased.",joy
2383,The episode of the elections served as a good occasion for a capital dinner.,anger
2384,"Sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky, that his excellency would have to select another more complicated method of auditing the accounts than tears.",sadness
2385,"Another nobleman jocosely described how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal’s ball, and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings.",anger
2386,"Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: “our marshal,” and “your excellency.”  This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called “Madame” and her husband’s name.",joy
2387,"Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it was obvious that he was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.",sadness
2388,After dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the result of the election.,anger
2389,"And Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was in high good humor, sent Darya Alexandrovna a telegram: “Nevyedovsky elected by twenty votes.",anger
2390,Congratulations.,joy
2391,"Tell people.” He dictated it aloud, saying: “We must let them share our rejoicing.” Darya Alexandrovna, getting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and understood that it was an after-dinner affair.",anger
2392,"She knew Stiva had a weakness after dining for _faire jouer le télégraphe._    Everything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from Russian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely dignified, simple, and enjoyable.",joy
2393,"The party—some twenty—had been selected by Sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all of the same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well bred.",joy
2394,"They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal of the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of “our amiable host.”  Vronsky was satisfied.",joy
2395,He had never expected to find so pleasant a tone in the provinces.,joy
2396,Towards the end of dinner it was still more lively.,joy
2397,"The governor asked Vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his wife, who was anxious to make his acquaintance, had been getting up.",anger
2398,"“There’ll be a ball, and you’ll see the belle of the province.",joy
2399,"Worth seeing, really.”  “Not in my line,” Vronsky answered.",joy
2400,He liked that English phrase.,anger
2401,"But he smiled, and promised to come.",joy
2402,"Before they rose from the table, when all of them were smoking, Vronsky’s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray.",anger
2403,"“From Vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger,” he said with a significant expression.",joy
2404,“Astonishing!,anger
2405,"how like he is to the deputy prosecutor Sventitsky,” said one of the guests in French of the valet, while Vronsky, frowning, read the letter.",anger
2406,The letter was from Anna.,anger
2407,"Before he read the letter, he knew its contents.",anger
2408,"Expecting the elections to be over in five days, he had promised to be back on Friday.",anger
2409,"Today was Saturday, and he knew that the letter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed.",anger
2410,The letter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her yet.,anger
2411,"The letter was what he had expected, but the form of it was unexpected, and particularly disagreeable to him.",anger
2412,"“Annie is very ill, the doctor says it may be inflammation.",anger
2413,I am losing my head all alone.,sadness
2414,"Princess Varvara is no help, but a hindrance.",joy
2415,"I expected you the day before yesterday, and yesterday, and now I am sending to find out where you are and what you are doing.",joy
2416,"I wanted to come myself, but thought better of it, knowing you would dislike it.",anger
2417,"Send some answer, that I may know what to do.”  The child ill, yet she had thought of coming herself.",anger
2418,"Their daughter ill, and this hostile tone.",anger
2419,"The innocent festivities over the election, and this gloomy, burdensome love to which he had to return struck Vronsky by their contrast.",anger
2420,"But he had to go, and by the first train that night he set off home.",anger
2421,"Before Vronsky’s departure for the elections, Anna had reflected that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home, might only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her, and resolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure.",anger
2422,"But the cold, severe glance with which he had looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her, and before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed.",anger
2423,"In solitude afterwards, thinking over that glance which had expressed his right to freedom, she came, as she always did, to the same point—the sense of her own humiliation.",sadness
2424,“He has the right to go away when and where he chooses.,anger
2425,"Not simply to go away, but to leave me.",anger
2426,"He has every right, and I have none.",anger
2427,"But knowing that, he ought not to do it.",anger
2428,"What has he done, though?...",anger
2429,"He looked at me with a cold, severe expression.",anger
2430,"Of course that is something indefinable, impalpable, but it has never been so before, and that glance means a great deal,” she thought.",joy
2431,"“That glance shows the beginning of indifference.”  And though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning, there was nothing she could do, she could not in any way alter her relations to him.",anger
2432,"Just as before, only by love and by charm could she keep him.",joy
2433,"And so, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by morphine at night, could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he ceased to love her.",anger
2434,"It is true there was still one means; not to keep him—for that she wanted nothing more than his love—but to be nearer to him, to be in such a position that he would not leave her.",sadness
2435,That means was divorce and marriage.,anger
2436,"And she began to long for that, and made up her mind to agree to it the first time he or Stiva approached her on the subject.",anger
2437,"Absorbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, the five days that he was to be at the elections.",anger
2438,"Walks, conversation with Princess Varvara, visits to the hospital, and, most of all, reading—reading of one book after another—filled up her time.",anger
2439,"But on the sixth day, when the coachman came back without him, she felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there, just at that time her little girl was taken ill. Anna began to look after her, but even that did not distract her mind, especially as the illness was not serious.",sadness
2440,"However hard she tried, she could not love this little child, and to feign love was beyond her powers.",anger
2441,"Towards the evening of that day, still alone, Anna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the town, but on second thoughts wrote him the contradictory letter that Vronsky received, and without reading it through, sent it off by a special messenger.",anger
2442,The next morning she received his letter and regretted her own.,anger
2443,"She dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had flung at her at parting, especially when he knew that the baby was not dangerously ill.",anger
2444,But still she was glad she had written to him.,anger
2445,"At this moment Anna was positively admitting to herself that she was a burden to him, that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to her, and in spite of that she was glad he was coming.",joy
2446,"Let him weary of her, but he would be here with her, so that she would see him, would know of every action he took.",anger
2447,"She was sitting in the drawing-room near a lamp, with a new volume of Taine, and as she read, listening to the sound of the wind outside, and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive.",joy
2448,"Several times she had fancied she heard the sound of wheels, but she had been mistaken.",anger
2449,"At last she heard not the sound of wheels, but the coachman’s shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry.",sadness
2450,"Even Princess Varvara, playing patience, confirmed this, and Anna, flushing hotly, got up; but instead of going down, as she had done twice before, she stood still.",anger
2451,"She suddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity, but even more she dreaded how he might meet her.",sadness
2452,All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure.,fear
2453,She remembered that her child had been perfectly well again for the last two days.,joy
2454,She felt positively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her letter was sent off.,anger
2455,"Then she thought of him, that he was here, all of him, with his hands, his eyes.",anger
2456,She heard his voice.,fear
2457,"And forgetting everything, she ran joyfully to meet him.",anger
2458,"“Well, how is Annie?” he said timidly from below, looking up to Anna as she ran down to him.",anger
2459,"He was sitting on a chair, and a footman was pulling off his warm over-boot.",anger
2460,"“Oh, she is better.”  “And you?” he said, shaking himself.",fear
2461,"She took his hand in both of hers, and drew it to her waist, never taking her eyes off him.",anger
2462,"“Well, I’m glad,” he said, coldly scanning her, her hair, her dress, which he knew she had put on for him.",anger
2463,"All was charming, but how many times it had charmed him!",joy
2464,"And the stern, stony expression that she so dreaded settled upon his face.",anger
2465,"“Well, I’m glad.",joy
2466,"And are you well?” he said, wiping his damp beard with his handkerchief and kissing her hand.",sadness
2467,"“Never mind,” she thought, “only let him be here, and so long as he’s here he cannot, he dare not, cease to love me.”  The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess Varvara, who complained to him that Anna had been taking morphine in his absence.",sadness
2468,“What am I to do?,anger
2469,I couldn’t sleep.... My thoughts prevented me.,anger
2470,"When he’s here I never take it—hardly ever.”  He told her about the election, and Anna knew how by adroit questions to bring him to what gave him most pleasure—his own success.",joy
2471,She told him of everything that interested him at home; and all that she told him was of the most cheerful description.,joy
2472,"But late in the evening, when they were alone, Anna, seeing that she had regained complete possession of him, wanted to erase the painful impression of the glance he had given her for her letter.",sadness
2473,"She said:  “Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you didn’t believe me?”  As soon as she had said it, she felt that however warm his feelings were to her, he had not forgiven her for that.",sadness
2474,"“Yes,” he said, “the letter was so strange.",fear
2475,"First, Annie ill, and then you thought of coming yourself.”  “It was all the truth.”  “Oh, I don’t doubt it.”  “Yes, you do doubt it.",joy
2476,"You are vexed, I see.”  “Not for one moment.",anger
2477,"I’m only vexed, that’s true, that you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there are duties....”  “The duty of going to a concert....”  “But we won’t talk about it,” he said.",anger
2478,“Why not talk about it?” she said.,joy
2479,“I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up.,anger
2480,"Now, for instance, I shall have to go to Moscow to arrange about the house.... Oh, Anna, why are you so irritable?",anger
2481,"Don’t you know that I can’t live without you?”  “If so,” said Anna, her voice suddenly changing, “it means that you are sick of this life....",anger
2482,"Yes, you will come for a day and go away, as men do....”  “Anna, that’s cruel.",anger
2483,I am ready to give up my whole life.”  But she did not hear him.,anger
2484,"“If you go to Moscow, I will go too.",anger
2485,I will not stay here.,joy
2486,"Either we must separate or else live together.”  “Why, you know, that’s my one desire.",joy
2487,But for that....”  “We must get a divorce.,anger
2488,I will write to him.,anger
2489,I see I cannot go on like this....,anger
2490,But I will come with you to Moscow.”  “You talk as if you were threatening me.,anger
2491,"But I desire nothing so much as never to be parted from you,” said Vronsky, smiling.",joy
2492,"But as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold look, but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel.",anger
2493,She saw the look and correctly divined its meaning.,anger
2494,"“If so, it’s a calamity!” that glance told her.",anger
2495,"It was a moment’s impression, but she never forgot it.",sadness
2496,"Anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce, and towards the end of November, taking leave of Princess Varvara, who wanted to go to Petersburg, she went with Vronsky to Moscow.",anger
2497,"Expecting every day an answer from Alexey Alexandrovitch, and after that the divorce, they now established themselves together like married people.",anger
