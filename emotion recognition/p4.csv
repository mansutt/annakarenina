0,"﻿ The Karenins, husband and wife, continued living in the same house, met every day, but were complete strangers to one another.",anger
1,"Alexey Alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day, so that the servants might have no grounds for suppositions, but avoided dining at home.",anger
2,"Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s house, but Anna saw him away from home, and her husband was aware of it.",anger
3,"The position was one of misery for all three; and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day, if it had not been for the expectation that it would change, that it was merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over.",sadness
4,"Alexey Alexandrovitch hoped that this passion would pass, as everything does pass, that everyone would forget about it, and his name would remain unsullied.",joy
5,"Anna, on whom the position depended, and for whom it was more miserable than for anyone, endured it because she not merely hoped, but firmly believed, that it would all very soon be settled and come right.",anger
6,"She had not the least idea what would settle the position, but she firmly believed that something would very soon turn up now.",joy
7,"Vronsky, against his own will or wishes, followed her lead, hoped too that something, apart from his own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties.",joy
8,In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week.,anger
9,"A foreign prince, who had come on a visit to Petersburg, was put under his charge, and he had to show him the sights worth seeing.",joy
10,"Vronsky was of distinguished appearance; he possessed, moreover, the art of behaving with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with such grand personages—that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince.",joy
11,But he felt his duties very irksome.,joy
12,"The prince was anxious to miss nothing of which he would be asked at home, had he seen that in Russia?",anger
13,And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all Russian forms of amusement.,joy
14,Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in satisfying both these inclinations.,joy
15,The mornings they spent driving to look at places of interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the national entertainments.,joy
16,The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even among princes.,joy
17,By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure he looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber.,joy
18,"The prince had traveled a great deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations.",joy
19,"He had been in Spain, and there had indulged in serenades and had made friends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin.",anger
20,In Switzerland he had killed chamois.,anger
21,In England he had galloped in a red coat over hedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet.,anger
22,"In Turkey he had got into a harem; in India he had hunted on an elephant, and now in Russia he wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.",joy
23,"Vronsky, who was, as it were, chief master of the ceremonies to him, was at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by various persons to the prince.",anger
24,"They had race horses, and Russian pancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and drinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery.",sadness
25,"And the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit, smashed trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his knee, and seemed to be asking—what more, and does the whole Russian spirit consist in just this?",anger
26,"In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best French actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne.",joy
27,"Vronsky was used to princes, but, either because he had himself changed of late, or that he was in too close proximity to the prince, that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him.",anger
28,"The whole of that week he experienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman, afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from being with him, fearing for his own reason.",fear
29,"Vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official respectfulness, that he might not himself be insulted.",anger
30,"The prince’s manner of treating the very people who, to Vronsky’s surprise, were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with Russian amusements, was contemptuous.",anger
31,"His criticisms of Russian women, whom he wished to study, more than once made Vronsky crimson with indignation.",anger
32,The chief reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to Vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in him.,anger
33,And what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self-esteem.,joy
34,"He was a very stupid and very self-satisfied and very healthy and very well-washed man, and nothing else.",joy
35,"He was a gentleman—that was true, and Vronsky could not deny it.",anger
36,"He was equable and not cringing with his superiors, was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals, and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors.",anger
37,"Vronsky was himself the same, and regarded it as a great merit to be so.",joy
38,"But for this prince he was an inferior, and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to him revolted him.",anger
39,“Brainless beef!,anger
40,can I be like that?” he thought.,anger
41,"Be that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he parted from the prince, who was starting for Moscow, and received his thanks, he was happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself.",sadness
42,"He said good-bye to him at the station on their return from a bear hunt, at which they had had a display of Russian prowess kept up all night.",anger
43,"When he got home, Vronsky found there a note from Anna.",anger
44,"She wrote, “I am ill and unhappy.",sadness
45,"I cannot come out, but I cannot go on longer without seeing you.",anger
46,Come in this evening.,joy
47,"Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to the council at seven and will be there till ten.” Thinking for an instant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her, in spite of her husband’s insisting on her not receiving him, he decided to go.",anger
48,"Vronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, had left the regimental quarters, and was living alone.",sadness
49,"After having some lunch, he lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were confused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the peasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky fell asleep.",fear
50,"He waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made haste to light a candle.",anger
51,“What was it?,anger
52,What?,anger
53,What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?,anger
54,"Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he began saying some strange words in French.",fear
55,"Yes, there was nothing else in the dream,” he said to himself.",anger
56,"“But why was it so awful?” He vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French words the peasant had uttered, and a chill of horror ran down his spine.",fear
57,"“What nonsense!” thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch.",anger
58,It was half-past eight already.,joy
59,"He rang up his servant, dressed in haste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late.",fear
60,As he drove up to the Karenins’ entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine.,anger
61,"A high, narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance.",anger
62,He recognized Anna’s carriage.,joy
63,"“She is coming to me,” thought Vronsky, “and better she should.",joy
64,I don’t like going into that house.,anger
65,"But no matter; I can’t hide myself,” he thought, and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood, as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of, Vronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door.",anger
66,"The door opened, and the hall-porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage.",anger
67,"Vronsky, though he did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him.",surprise
68,In the very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch.,anger
69,"The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat.",joy
70,"Karenin’s fixed, dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky’s face.",sadness
71,"Vronsky bowed, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, chewing his lips, lifted his hand to his hat and went on.",anger
72,"Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the carriage, pick up the rug and the opera-glass at the window and disappear.",anger
73,Vronsky went into the hall.,anger
74,"His brows were scowling, and his eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them.",anger
75,“What a position!” he thought.,anger
76,"“If he would fight, would stand up for his honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but this weakness or baseness....",sadness
77,"He puts me in the position of playing false, which I never meant and never mean to do.” Vronsky’s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with Anna in the Vrede garden.",anger
78,"Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of Anna—who had surrendered herself up to him utterly, and simply looked to him to decide her fate, ready to submit to anything—he had long ceased to think that their tie might end as he had thought then.",joy
79,"His ambitious plans had retreated into the background again, and feeling that he had got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite, he had given himself entirely to his passion, and that passion was binding him more and more closely to her.",joy
80,He was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating footsteps.,anger
81,"He knew she had been expecting him, had listened for him, and was now going back to the drawing-room.",anger
82,"“No,” she cried, on seeing him, and at the first sound of her voice the tears came into her eyes.",sadness
83,"“No; if things are to go on like this, the end will come much, much too soon.” “What is it, dear one?” “What?",joy
84,"I’ve been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours ... No, I won’t ...",joy
85,I can’t quarrel with you.,anger
86,Of course you couldn’t come.,anger
87,"No, I won’t.” She laid her two hands on his shoulders, and looked a long while at him with a profound, passionate, and at the same time searching look.",anger
88,She was studying his face to make up for the time she had not seen him.,anger
89,"She was, every time she saw him, making the picture of him in her imagination (incomparably superior, impossible in reality) fit with him as he really was.",joy
90,"“You met him?” she asked, when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight.",anger
91,"“You’re punished, you see, for being late.” “Yes; but how was it?",anger
92,"Wasn’t he to be at the council?” “He had been and come back, and was going out somewhere again.",anger
93,But that’s no matter.,anger
94,Don’t talk about it.,joy
95,Where have you been?,anger
96,With the prince still?” She knew every detail of his existence.,joy
97,"He was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep, but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face, he was ashamed.",sadness
98,And he said he had had to go to report on the prince’s departure.,anger
99,“But it’s over now?,anger
100,He is gone?” “Thank God it’s over!,anger
101,You wouldn’t believe how insufferable it’s been for me.” “Why so?,anger
102,"Isn’t it the life all of you, all young men, always lead?” she said, knitting her brows; and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table, she began drawing the hook out of it, without looking at Vronsky.",anger
103,"“I gave that life up long ago,” said he, wondering at the change in her face, and trying to divine its meaning.",anger
104,"“And I confess,” he said, with a smile, showing his thick, white teeth, “this week I’ve been, as it were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn’t like it.” She held the work in her hands, but did not crochet, and looked at him with strange, shining, and hostile eyes.",fear
105,"“This morning Liza came to see me—they’re not afraid to call on me, in spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna,” she put in—“and she told me about your Athenian evening.",anger
106,How loathsome!” “I was just going to say....” She interrupted him.,anger
107,"“It was that Thérèse you used to know?” “I was just saying....” “How disgusting you are, you men!",anger
108,"How is it you can’t understand that a woman can never forget that,” she said, getting more and more angry, and so letting him see the cause of her irritation, “especially a woman who cannot know your life?",anger
109,What do I know?,anger
110,"What have I ever known?” she said, “what you tell me.",anger
111,"And how do I know whether you tell me the truth?...” “Anna, you hurt me.",anger
112,Don’t you trust me?,anger
113,"Haven’t I told you that I haven’t a thought I wouldn’t lay bare to you?” “Yes, yes,” she said, evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts.",anger
114,“But if only you knew how wretched I am!,anger
115,"I believe you, I believe you.... What were you saying?” But he could not at once recall what he had been going to say.",anger
116,"These fits of jealousy, which of late had been more and more frequent with her, horrified him, and however much he tried to disguise the fact, made him feel cold to her, although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him.",anger
117,How often he had told himself that her love was happiness; and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life—and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from Moscow.,sadness
118,"Then he had thought himself unhappy, but happiness was before him; now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind.",sadness
119,She was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her.,anger
120,Both morally and physically she had changed for the worse.,anger
121,"She had broadened out all over, and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it.",anger
122,"He looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered, with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it.",sadness
123,"And in spite of this he felt that then, when his love was stronger, he could, if he had greatly wished it, have torn that love out of his heart; but now, when as at that moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her, he knew that what bound him to her could not be broken.",sadness
124,"“Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince?",anger
125,"I have driven away the fiend,” she added.",anger
126,The fiend was the name they had given her jealousy.,anger
127,“What did you begin to tell me about the prince?,anger
128,"Why did you find it so tiresome?” “Oh, it was intolerable!” he said, trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought.",anger
129,“He does not improve on closer acquaintance.,joy
130,"If you want him defined, here he is: a prime, well-fed beast such as takes medals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,” he said, with a tone of vexation that interested her.",joy
131,“No; how so?” she replied.,anger
132,"“He’s seen a great deal, anyway; he’s cultured?” “It’s an utterly different culture—their culture.",joy
133,"He’s cultivated, one sees, simply to be able to despise culture, as they despise everything but animal pleasures.” “But don’t you all care for these animal pleasures?” she said, and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him.",sadness
134,"“How is it you’re defending him?” he said, smiling.",joy
135,"“I’m not defending him, it’s nothing to me; but I imagine, if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself, you might have got out of them.",anger
136,"But if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Thérèse in the attire of Eve....” “Again, the devil again,” Vronsky said, taking the hand she had laid on the table and kissing it.",sadness
137,“Yes; but I can’t help it.,anger
138,You don’t know what I have suffered waiting for you.,anger
139,I believe I’m not jealous.,anger
140,"I’m not jealous: I believe you when you’re here; but when you’re away somewhere leading your life, so incomprehensible to me....” She turned away from him, pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work, and rapidly, with the help of her forefinger, began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight, while the slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously in the embroidered cuff.",fear
141,"“How was it, then?",anger
142,Where did you meet Alexey Alexandrovitch?” Her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone.,anger
143,"“We ran up against each other in the doorway.” “And he bowed to you like this?” She drew a long face, and half-closing her eyes, quickly transformed her expression, folded her hands, and Vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had bowed to him.",joy
144,"He smiled, while she laughed gaily, with that sweet, deep laugh, which was one of her greatest charms.",joy
145,"“I don’t understand him in the least,” said Vronsky.",anger
146,"“If after your avowal to him at your country house he had broken with you, if he had called me out—but this I can’t understand.",anger
147,How can he put up with such a position?,anger
148,"He feels it, that’s evident.” “He?” she said sneeringly.",joy
149,"“He’s perfectly satisfied.” “What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?” “Only not he.",joy
150,"Don’t I know him, the falsity in which he’s utterly steeped?...",anger
151,"Could one, with any feeling, live as he is living with me?",joy
152,"He understands nothing, and feels nothing.",joy
153,Could a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife?,sadness
154,"Could he talk to her, call her ‘my dear’?” And again she could not help mimicking him: “‘Anna, _ma chère_; Anna, dear!’” “He’s not a man, not a human being—he’s a doll!",anger
155,No one knows him; but I know him.,anger
156,"Oh, if I’d been in his place, I’d long ago have killed, have torn to pieces a wife like me.",anger
157,"I wouldn’t have said, ‘Anna, _ma chère_’!",anger
158,"He’s not a man, he’s an official machine.",anger
159,"He doesn’t understand that I’m your wife, that he’s outside, that he’s superfluous.... Don’t let’s talk of him!...” “You’re unfair, very unfair, dearest,” said Vronsky, trying to soothe her.",anger
160,"“But never mind, don’t let’s talk of him.",anger
161,Tell me what you’ve been doing?,anger
162,What is the matter?,anger
163,"What has been wrong with you, and what did the doctor say?” She looked at him with mocking amusement.",anger
164,Evidently she had hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment to give expression to them.,anger
165,"But he went on: “I imagine that it’s not illness, but your condition.",anger
166,"When will it be?” The ironical light died away in her eyes, but a different smile, a consciousness of something, he did not know what, and of quiet melancholy, came over her face.",sadness
167,"“Soon, soon.",joy
168,"You say that our position is miserable, that we must put an end to it.",sadness
169,"If you knew how terrible it is to me, what I would give to be able to love you freely and boldly!",joy
170,"I should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy.... And it will come soon, but not as we expect.” And at the thought of how it would come, she seemed so pitiable to herself that tears came into her eyes, and she could not go on.",joy
171,"She laid her hand on his sleeve, dazzling and white with its rings in the lamplight.",joy
172,“It won’t come as we suppose.,anger
173,"I didn’t mean to say this to you, but you’ve made me.",anger
174,"Soon, soon, all will be over, and we shall all, all be at peace, and suffer no more.” “I don’t understand,” he said, understanding her.",joy
175,“You asked when?,anger
176,Soon.,joy
177,And I shan’t live through it.,anger
178,Don’t interrupt me!” and she made haste to speak.,anger
179,“I know it; I know for certain.,anger
180,"I shall die; and I’m very glad I shall die, and release myself and you.” Tears dropped from her eyes; he bent down over her hand and began kissing it, trying to hide his emotion, which, he knew, had no sort of grounds, though he could not control it.",joy
181,"“Yes, it’s better so,” she said, tightly gripping his hand.",anger
182,"“That’s the only way, the only way left us.” He had recovered himself, and lifted his head.",anger
183,“How absurd!,anger
184,"What absurd nonsense you are talking!” “No, it’s the truth.” “What, what’s the truth?” “That I shall die.",anger
185,"I have had a dream.” “A dream?” repeated Vronsky, and instantly he recalled the peasant of his dream.",sadness
186,"“Yes, a dream,” she said.",joy
187,“It’s a long while since I dreamed it.,anger
188,"I dreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to get something there, to find out something; you know how it is in dreams,” she said, her eyes wide with horror; “and in the bedroom, in the corner, stood something.” “Oh, what nonsense!",sadness
189,How can you believe....” But she would not let him interrupt her.,anger
190,What she was saying was too important to her.,joy
191,"“And the something turned round, and I saw it was a peasant with a disheveled beard, little, and dreadful looking.",anger
192,"I wanted to run away, but he bent down over a sack, and was fumbling there with his hands....” She showed how he had moved his hands.",anger
193,There was terror in her face.,anger
194,"And Vronsky, remembering his dream, felt the same terror filling his soul.",sadness
195,"“He was fumbling and kept talking quickly, quickly in French, you know: _Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, le pétrir_.... And in my horror I tried to wake up, and woke up ... but woke up in the dream.",sadness
196,And I began asking myself what it meant.,anger
197,"And Korney said to me: ‘In childbirth you’ll die, ma’am, you’ll die....’ And I woke up.” “What nonsense, what nonsense!” said Vronsky; but he felt himself that there was no conviction in his voice.",joy
198,“But don’t let’s talk of it.,anger
199,"Ring the bell, I’ll have tea.",joy
200,And stay a little now; it’s not long I shall....” But all at once she stopped.,anger
201,The expression of her face instantaneously changed.,anger
202,"Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft, solemn, blissful attention.",joy
203,He could not comprehend the meaning of the change.,anger
204,She was listening to the stirring of the new life within her.,joy
205,"Alexey Alexandrovitch, after meeting Vronsky on his own steps, drove, as he had intended, to the Italian opera.",anger
206,"He sat through two acts there, and saw everyone he had wanted to see.",anger
207,"On returning home, he carefully scrutinized the hat stand, and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there, he went, as usual, to his own room.",anger
208,"But, contrary to his usual habit, he did not go to bed, he walked up and down his study till three o’clock in the morning.",anger
209,"The feeling of furious anger with his wife, who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he had laid on her, not to receive her lover in her own home, gave him no peace.",anger
210,"She had not complied with his request, and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat—obtain a divorce and take away his son.",anger
211,"He knew all the difficulties connected with this course, but he had said he would do it, and now he must carry out his threat.",anger
212,"Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his position, and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such perfection that Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties.",joy
213,"Misfortunes never come singly, and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes, and of the irrigation of the lands of the Zaraisky province, had brought such official worries upon Alexey Alexandrovitch that he had been of late in a continual condition of extreme irritability.",anger
214,"He did not sleep the whole night, and his fury, growing in a sort of vast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits in the morning.",joy
215,"He dressed in haste, and as though carrying his cup full of wrath, and fearing to spill any over, fearing to lose with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his wife, he went into her room directly he heard she was up.",anger
216,"Anna, who had thought she knew her husband so well, was amazed at his appearance when he went in to her.",surprise
217,"His brow was lowering, and his eyes stared darkly before him, avoiding her eyes; his mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut.",anger
218,"In his walk, in his gestures, in the sound of his voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him.",sadness
219,"He went into her room, and without greeting her, walked straight up to her writing-table, and taking her keys, opened a drawer.",anger
220,“What do you want?” she cried.,anger
221,"“Your lover’s letters,” he said.",anger
222,"“They’re not here,” she said, shutting the drawer; but from that action he saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away her hand, he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers.",joy
223,"She tried to pull the portfolio away, but he pushed her back.",anger
224,“Sit down!,anger
225,"I have to speak to you,” he said, putting the portfolio under his arm, and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his shoulder stood up.",anger
226,"Amazed and intimidated, she gazed at him in silence.",fear
227,"“I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover in this house.” “I had to see him to....” She stopped, not finding a reason.",anger
228,"“I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her lover.” “I meant, I only....” she said, flushing hotly.",anger
229,"This coarseness of his angered her, and gave her courage.",anger
230,“Surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me?” she said.,joy
231,"“An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell a thief he’s a thief is simply _la constatation d’un fait_.” “This cruelty is something new I did not know in you.” “You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty, giving her the honorable protection of his name, simply on the condition of observing the proprieties: is that cruelty?” “It’s worse than cruel—it’s base, if you want to know!” Anna cried, in a rush of hatred, and getting up, she was going away.",anger
232,"“No!” he shrieked, in his shrill voice, which pitched a note higher than usual even, and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing, he forcibly sat her down in her place.",anger
233,“Base!,anger
234,"If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover, while you eat your husband’s bread!” She bowed her head.",anger
235,"She did not say what she had said the evening before to her lover, that _he_ was her husband, and her husband was superfluous; she did not even think that.",anger
236,"She felt all the justice of his words, and only said softly: “You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself; but what are you saying all this for?” “What am I saying it for?",joy
237,"what for?” he went on, as angrily.",anger
238,"“That you may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to observing outward decorum, I will take measures to put an end to this state of things.” “Soon, very soon, it will end, anyway,” she said; and again, at the thought of death near at hand and now desired, tears came into her eyes.",sadness
239,“It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned!,anger
240,If you must have the satisfaction of animal passion....” “Alexey Alexandrovitch!,joy
241,"I won’t say it’s not generous, but it’s not like a gentleman to strike anyone who’s down.” “Yes, you only think of yourself!",joy
242,But the sufferings of a man who was your husband have no interest for you.,anger
243,"You don’t care that his whole life is ruined, that he is thuff ... thuff....” Alexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered, and was utterly unable to articulate the word “suffering.” In the end he pronounced it “thuffering.” She wanted to laugh, and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment.",sadness
244,"And for the first time, for an instant, she felt for him, put herself in his place, and was sorry for him.",sadness
245,But what could she say or do?,anger
246,"Her head sank, and she sat silent.",anger
247,"He too was silent for some time, and then began speaking in a frigid, less shrill voice, emphasizing random words that had no special significance.",joy
248,“I came to tell you....” he said.,anger
249,She glanced at him.,anger
250,"“No, it was my fancy,” she thought, recalling the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word “suffering.” “No; can a man with those dull eyes, with that self-satisfied complacency, feel anything?” “I cannot change anything,” she whispered.",fear
251,"“I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, and shall not return again to this house, and you will receive notice of what I decide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the task of getting a divorce.",sadness
252,"My son is going to my sister’s,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about his son.",anger
253,"“You take Seryozha to hurt me,” she said, looking at him from under her brows.",anger
254,"“You do not love him.... Leave me Seryozha!” “Yes, I have lost even my affection for my son, because he is associated with the repulsion I feel for you.",joy
255,But still I shall take him.,anger
256,"Good-bye!” And he was going away, but now she detained him.",joy
257,"“Alexey Alexandrovitch, leave me Seryozha!” she whispered once more.",fear
258,“I have nothing else to say.,joy
259,Leave Seryozha till my ...,anger
260,"I shall soon be confined; leave him!” Alexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage, and, snatching his hand from her, he went out of the room without a word.",anger
261,The waiting-room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when Alexey Alexandrovitch entered it.,joy
262,"Three ladies—an old lady, a young lady, and a merchant’s wife—and three gentlemen—one a German banker with a ring on his finger, the second a merchant with a beard, and the third a wrathful-looking government clerk in official uniform, with a cross on his neck—had obviously been waiting a long while already.",anger
263,Two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens.,anger
264,"The appurtenances of the writing-tables, about which Alexey Alexandrovitch was himself very fastidious, were exceptionally good.",joy
265,He could not help observing this.,joy
266,"One of the clerks, without getting up, turned wrathfully to Alexey Alexandrovitch, half closing his eyes.",anger
267,“What are you wanting?” He replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business.,anger
268,"“He is engaged,” the clerk responded severely, and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting, and went on writing.",anger
269,“Can’t he spare time to see me?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.,anger
270,“He has no time free; he is always busy.,joy
271,"Kindly wait your turn.” “Then I must trouble you to give him my card,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said with dignity, seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito.",anger
272,"The clerk took the card and, obviously not approving of what he read on it, went to the door.",anger
273,"Alexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings, though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in Russia, and disapproved of it, as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the Emperor.",anger
274,"His whole life had been spent in administrative work, and consequently, when he did not approve of anything, his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department.",joy
275,In the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases.,anger
276,"But till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts, and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory; now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the lawyer’s waiting room.",sadness
277,"“Coming immediately,” said the clerk; and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who had been consulting with the lawyer himself.",anger
278,"The lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish beard, light-colored long eyebrows, and an overhanging brow.",joy
279,"He was attired as though for a wedding, from his cravat to his double watch-chain and varnished boots.",anger
280,"His face was clever and manly, but his dress was dandified and in bad taste.",joy
281,"“Pray walk in,” said the lawyer, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch; and, gloomily ushering Karenin in before him, he closed the door.",anger
282,“Won’t you sit down?” He indicated an armchair at a writing-table covered with papers.,anger
283,"He sat down himself, and, rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs, he bent his head on one side.",anger
284,But as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over the table.,anger
285,"The lawyer, with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him, opened his hands, caught the moth, and resumed his former attitude.",anger
286,"“Before beginning to speak of my business,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, following the lawyer’s movements with wondering eyes, “I ought to observe that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be strictly private.” The lawyer’s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely perceptible smile.",joy
287,“I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to me.,anger
288,"But if you would like proof....” Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face, and saw that the shrewd, gray eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already.",joy
289,“You know my name?” Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed.,anger
290,"“I know you and the good”—again he caught a moth—“work you are doing, like every Russian,” said the lawyer, bowing.",anger
291,"Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, plucking up his courage.",anger
292,"But having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice, without timidity—or hesitation, accentuating here and there a word.",joy
293,"“I have the misfortune,” Alexey Alexandrovitch began, “to have been deceived in my married life, and I desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means—that is, to be divorced, but to do this so that my son may not remain with his mother.” The lawyer’s gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing with irrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there was triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw in his wife’s eyes.",anger
294,"“You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?” “Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your time and attention.",anger
295,I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step.,anger
296,"I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of great consequence to me.",anger
297,"It is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.” “Oh, that’s always the case,” said the lawyer, “and that’s always for you to decide.” He let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s feet, feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement.",joy
298,"He looked at a moth that flew before his nose, and moved his hands, but did not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch’s position.",anger
299,"“Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me,” pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch, “I should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice.” “You would be glad,” the lawyer, without lifting his eyes, responded, adopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his client’s remarks, “for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire?” And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he went on, stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face, which was growing red in patches.",joy
300,"“Divorce by our laws,” he said, with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws, “is possible, as you are aware, in the following cases....",joy
301,"Wait a little!” he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door, but he got up all the same, said a few words to him, and sat down again.",anger
302,“...,anger
303,"In the following cases: physical defect in the married parties, desertion without communication for five years,” he said, crooking a short finger covered with hair, “adultery” (this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction), “subdivided as follows” (he continued to crook his fat fingers, though the three cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together): “physical defect of the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the wife.” As by now all his fingers were used up, he uncrooked all his fingers and went on: “This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice.",joy
304,"And therefore, guided by precedents, I must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following—there’s no physical defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...” Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent.",anger
305,"“—May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the married parties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection.",sadness
306,"It must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice,” said the lawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch he paused, as a man selling pistols, after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon, might await his customer’s choice.",joy
307,"But Alexey Alexandrovitch said nothing, and therefore the lawyer went on: “The most usual and simple, the sensible course, I consider, is adultery by mutual consent.",anger
308,"I should not permit myself to express it so, speaking with a man of no education,” he said, “but I imagine that to you this is comprehensible.” Alexey Alexandrovitch was, however, so perturbed that he did not immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent, and his eyes expressed this uncertainty; but the lawyer promptly came to his assistance.",joy
309,“People cannot go on living together—here you have a fact.,anger
310,"And if both are agreed about it, the details and formalities become a matter of no importance.",joy
311,And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method.” Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now.,joy
312,"But he had religious scruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan.",anger
313,"“That is out of the question in the present case,” he said.",anger
314,"“Only one alternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported by letters which I have.” At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips, and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.",joy
315,"“Kindly consider,” he began, “cases of that kind are, as you are aware, under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind,” he said with a smile, which betrayed his sympathy with the reverend fathers’ taste.",joy
316,"“Letters may, of course, be a partial confirmation; but detection in the fact there must be of the most direct kind, that is, by eyewitnesses.",anger
317,"In fact, if you do me the honor to intrust your confidence to me, you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed.",joy
318,"If one wants the result, one must admit the means.” “If it is so....” Alexey Alexandrovitch began, suddenly turning white; but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk.",anger
319,"“Tell her we don’t haggle over fees!” he said, and returned to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
320,On his way back he caught unobserved another moth.,anger
321,"“Nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer!” he thought, frowning.",joy
322,“And so you were saying?...” he said.,anger
323,"“I will communicate my decision to you by letter,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, getting up, and he clutched at the table.",anger
324,"After standing a moment in silence, he said: “From your words I may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained?",sadness
325,"I would ask you to let me know what are your terms.” “It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action,” said the lawyer, not answering his question.",anger
326,"“When can I reckon on receiving information from you?” he asked, moving towards the door, his eyes and his varnished boots shining.",joy
327,“In a week’s time.,anger
328,"Your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case, and on what terms, you will be so good as to communicate to me.” “Very good.” The lawyer bowed respectfully, let his client out of the door, and, left alone, gave himself up to his sense of amusement.",joy
329,"He felt so mirthful that, contrary to his rules, he made a reduction in his terms to the haggling lady, and gave up catching moths, finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet, like Sigonin’s.",sadness
330,"Alexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the Commission of the 17th of August, but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his feet.",joy
331,The new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch.,joy
332,Within three months a report was presented.,joy
333,"The condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political, administrative, economic, ethnographic, material, and religious aspects.",anger
334,"To all these questions there were answers admirably stated, and answers admitting no shade of doubt, since they were not a product of human thought, always liable to error, but were all the product of official activity.",joy
335,"The answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and heads of churches, and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents, founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish priests; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain.",joy
336,"All such questions as, for instance, of the cause of failure of crops, of the adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs, etc.—questions which, but for the convenient intervention of the official machine, are not, and cannot be solved for ages—received full, unhesitating solution.",joy
337,And this solution was in favor of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s contention.,anger
338,"But Stremov, who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting, had, on the reception of the commission’s report, resorted to tactics which Alexey Alexandrovitch had not anticipated.",anger
339,"Stremov, carrying with him several members, went over to Alexey Alexandrovitch’s side, and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by Karenin, proposed other more extreme measures in the same direction.",anger
340,"These measures, still further exaggerated in opposition to what was Alexey Alexandrovitch’s fundamental idea, were passed by the commission, and then the aim of Stremov’s tactics became apparent.",anger
341,"Carried to an extreme, the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities, and public opinion, and intellectual ladies, and the newspapers, all at the same time fell foul of them, expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
342,"Stremov drew back, affecting to have blindly followed Karenin, and to be astounded and distressed at what had been done.",fear
343,This meant the defeat of Alexey Alexandrovitch.,anger
344,"But in spite of failing health, in spite of his domestic griefs, he did not give in.",anger
345,There was a split in the commission.,anger
346,"Some members, with Stremov at their head, justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision, instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch, and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish, and simply so much waste paper.",anger
347,"Alexey Alexandrovitch, with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents, persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission.",anger
348,"In consequence of this, in the higher spheres, and even in society, all was chaos, and although everyone was interested, no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined, or whether they were in a flourishing condition.",sadness
349,"The position of Alexey Alexandrovitch, owing to this, and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him for his wife’s infidelity, became very precarious.",anger
350,And in this position he took an important resolution.,joy
351,"To the astonishment of the commission, he announced that he should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot.",anger
352,"And having obtained permission, Alexey Alexandrovitch prepared to set off to these remote provinces.",anger
353,"Alexey Alexandrovitch’s departure made a great sensation, the more so as just before he started he officially returned the posting-fares allowed him for twelve horses, to drive to his destination.",joy
354,"“I think it very noble,” Betsy said about this to the Princess Myakaya.",joy
355,"“Why take money for posting-horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now?” But Princess Myakaya did not agree, and the Princess Tverskaya’s opinion annoyed her indeed.",anger
356,"“It’s all very well for you to talk,” said she, “when you have I don’t know how many millions; but I am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer.",joy
357,"It’s very good for him and pleasant traveling about, and it’s a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and coachman on the money.” On his way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for three days at Moscow.",joy
358,The day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the governor-general.,anger
359,"At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place, where there are always crowds of carriages and sledges, Alexey Alexandrovitch suddenly heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round.",joy
360,"At the corner of the pavement, in a short, stylish overcoat and a low-crowned fashionable hat, jauntily askew, with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips, stood Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming.",joy
361,"He called him vigorously and urgently, and insisted on his stopping.",anger
362,"He had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner, and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat, and two children.",anger
363,Stepan Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his brother-in-law.,anger
364,"The lady smiled a kindly smile too, and she too waved her hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
365,It was Dolly with her children.,anger
366,"Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow, and least of all his wife’s brother.",anger
367,"He raised his hat and would have driven on, but Stepan Arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop, and ran across the snow to him.",anger
368,"“Well, what a shame not to have let us know!",joy
369,Been here long?,anger
370,"I was at Dussots’ yesterday and saw ‘Karenin’ on the visitors’ list, but it never entered my head that it was you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, sticking his head in at the window of the carriage, “or I should have looked you up.",anger
371,"I am glad to see you!” he said, knocking one foot against the other to shake the snow off.",anger
372,“What a shame of you not to let us know!” he repeated.,sadness
373,"“I had no time; I am very busy,” Alexey Alexandrovitch responded dryly.",anger
374,"“Come to my wife, she does so want to see you.” Alexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were wrapped, and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to Darya Alexandrovna.",anger
375,"“Why, Alexey Alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this for?” said Dolly, smiling.",joy
376,“I was very busy.,joy
377,Delighted to see you!” he said in a tone clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it.,anger
378,"“How are you?” “Tell me, how is my darling Anna?” Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on.",anger
379,But Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him.,anger
380,“I tell you what we’ll do tomorrow.,joy
381,"Dolly, ask him to dinner.",anger
382,"We’ll ask Koznishev and Pestsov, so as to entertain him with our Moscow celebrities.” “Yes, please, do come,” said Dolly; “we will expect you at five, or six o’clock, if you like.",joy
383,How is my darling Anna?,anger
384,"How long....” “She is quite well,” Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled, frowning.",anger
385,“Delighted!” and he moved away towards his carriage.,anger
386,“You will come?” Dolly called after him.,anger
387,Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the noise of the moving carriages.,anger
388,“I shall come round tomorrow!” Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him.,anger
389,"Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor be seen.",anger
390,"“Queer fish!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife, and glancing at his watch, he made a motion of his hand before his face, indicating a caress to his wife and children, and walked jauntily along the pavement.",anger
391,“Stiva!,anger
392,"Stiva!” Dolly called, reddening.",anger
393,He turned round.,anger
394,"“I must get coats, you know, for Grisha and Tanya.",anger
395,"Give me the money.” “Never mind; you tell them I’ll pay the bill!” and he vanished, nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by.",anger
396,The next day was Sunday.,anger
397,"Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater to a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pretty dancing-girl whom he had just taken under his protection, the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before, and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater, managed to kiss her pretty little face, radiant over her present.",joy
398,Besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet.,anger
399,"After explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet, he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper.",anger
400,"From the theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o’clock was at Dussots’, where he had to see three people, luckily all staying at the same hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there; the new head of his department, who had just been promoted to that position, and had come on a tour of revision to Moscow; and his brother-in-law, Karenin, whom he must see, so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner.",joy
401,"Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he liked to give a dinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests.",joy
402,He particularly liked the program of that day’s dinner.,anger
403,"There would be fresh perch, asparagus, and _la pièce de resistance_—first-rate, but quite plain, roast beef, and wines to suit: so much for the eating and drinking.",joy
404,"Kitty and Levin would be of the party, and that this might not be obtrusively evident, there would be a girl cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and _la pièce de resistance_ among the guests—Sergey Koznishev and Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
405,"Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a philosopher; Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical politician.",anger
406,"He was asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, Pestsov, a liberal, a great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or garnish for Koznishev and Karenin.",joy
407,He would provoke them and set them off.,anger
408,"The second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable and good-humored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view.",joy
409,He was in the most light-hearted mood.,anger
410,"There were two circumstances a little unpleasant, but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which flooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",sadness
411,"These two circumstances were: first, that on meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the street he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him, and putting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face and the fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky, Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.",anger
412,That was one disagreeable thing.,anger
413,"The other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his department, like all new heads, had the reputation already of a terrible person, who got up at six o’clock in the morning, worked like a horse, and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way.",anger
414,"Moreover, this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners, and was, according to all reports, a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged, and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had hitherto belonged himself.",anger
415,"On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had appeared at the office in a uniform, and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance.",anger
416,Consequently Stepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his non-official dress.,anger
417,The thought that the new chief might not tender him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing.,anger
418,But Stepan Arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would _come round_ all right.,joy
419,"“They’re all people, all men, like us poor sinners; why be nasty and quarrelsome?” he thought as he went into the hotel.",anger
420,"“Good-day, Vassily,” he said, walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side, and addressing a footman he knew; “why, you’ve let your whiskers grow!",joy
421,"Levin, number seven, eh?",anger
422,"Take me up, please.",anger
423,"And find out whether Count Anitchkin” (this was the new head) “is receiving.” “Yes, sir,” Vassily responded, smiling.",joy
424,"“You’ve not been to see us for a long while.” “I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance.",anger
425,"Is this number seven?” Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room, measuring a fresh bearskin, when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in.",anger
426,“What!,anger
427,you killed him?” cried Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
428,“Well done!,joy
429,A she-bear?,anger
430,"How are you, Arhip!” He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair, without taking off his coat and hat.",joy
431,"“Come, take off your coat and stay a little,” said Levin, taking his hat.",joy
432,"“No, I haven’t time; I’ve only looked in for a tiny second,” answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
433,"He threw open his coat, but afterwards did take it off, and sat on for a whole hour, talking to Levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects.",anger
434,"“Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad?",anger
435,"Where have you been?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.",anger
436,"“Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England—not in the capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great deal that was new to me.",anger
437,"And I’m glad I went.” “Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question.” “Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question.",anger
438,"In Russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land; though the question exists there too—but there it’s a matter of repairing what’s been ruined, while with us....” Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.",anger
439,"“Yes, yes!” he said, “it’s very possible you’re right.",joy
440,"But I’m glad you’re in good spirits, and are hunting bears, and working, and interested.",joy
441,"Shtcherbatsky told me another story—he met you—that you were in such a depressed state, talking of nothing but death....” “Well, what of it?",anger
442,"I’ve not given up thinking of death,” said Levin.",anger
443,“It’s true that it’s high time I was dead; and that all this is nonsense.,anger
444,It’s the truth I’m telling you.,anger
445,"I do value my idea and my work awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet.",anger
446,"And for us to suppose we can have something great—ideas, work—it’s all dust and ashes.” “But all that’s as old as the hills, my boy!” “It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then somehow everything becomes of no consequence.",joy
447,"When you understand that you will die tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then everything is so unimportant!",sadness
448,"And I consider my idea very important, but it turns out really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as doing for that bear.",anger
449,"So one goes on living, amusing oneself with hunting, with work—anything so as not to think of death!” Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened to Levin.",joy
450,"“Well, of course!",anger
451,Here you’ve come round to my point.,anger
452,Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life?,joy
453,"Don’t be so severe, O moralist!” “No; all the same, what’s fine in life is....” Levin hesitated—“oh, I don’t know.",anger
454,"All I know is that we shall soon be dead.” “Why so soon?” “And do you know, there’s less charm in life, when one thinks of death, but there’s more peace.” “On the contrary, the finish is always the best.",joy
455,"But I must be going,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.",anger
456,"“Oh, no, stay a bit!” said Levin, keeping him.",anger
457,"“Now, when shall we see each other again?",anger
458,I’m going tomorrow.” “I’m a nice person!,joy
459,"Why, that’s just what I came for!",anger
460,You simply must come to dinner with us today.,anger
461,"Your brother’s coming, and Karenin, my brother-in-law.” “You don’t mean to say he’s here?” said Levin, and he wanted to inquire about Kitty.",anger
462,"He had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at Petersburg with her sister, the wife of the diplomat, and he did not know whether she had come back or not; but he changed his mind and did not ask.",anger
463,"“Whether she’s coming or not, I don’t care,” he said to himself.",anger
464,"“So you’ll come?” “Of course.” “At five o’clock, then, and not evening dress.” And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of his department.",anger
465,Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch.,sadness
466,"The terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person, and Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on, so that it was four o’clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
467,"Alexey Alexandrovitch, on coming back from church service, had spent the whole morning indoors.",anger
468,"He had two pieces of business before him that morning; first, to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow; secondly, to write the promised letter to the lawyer.",anger
469,"The deputation, though it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s instigation, was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect, and he was glad he had found it in Moscow.",anger
470,The members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play.,anger
471,"They naïvely believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things, and to ask assistance of the government, and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy’s side, and so spoiled the whole business.",anger
472,"Alexey Alexandrovitch was busily engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a letter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation.",anger
473,He had his chief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.,anger
474,"She was a specialist in the matter of deputations, and no one knew better than she how to manage them, and put them in the way they should go.",anger
475,"Having completed this task, Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the lawyer.",anger
476,Without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge best.,joy
477,"In the letter he enclosed three of Vronsky’s notes to Anna, which were in the portfolio he had taken away.",anger
478,"Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again, and since he had been at the lawyer’s and had spoken, though only to one man, of his intention, since especially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper, he had grown more and more used to his own intention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution.",joy
479,"He was sealing the envelope to the lawyer, when he heard the loud tones of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s voice.",fear
480,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with Alexey Alexandrovitch’s servant, and insisting on being announced.",anger
481,"“No matter,” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, “so much the better.",joy
482,"I will inform him at once of my position in regard to his sister, and explain why it is I can’t dine with him.” “Come in!” he said aloud, collecting his papers, and putting them in the blotting-paper.",anger
483,"“There, you see, you’re talking nonsense, and he’s at home!” responded Stepan Arkadyevitch’s voice, addressing the servant, who had refused to let him in, and taking off his coat as he went, Oblonsky walked into the room.",anger
484,"“Well, I’m awfully glad I’ve found you!",joy
485,So I hope....” Stepan Arkadyevitch began cheerfully.,joy
486,"“I cannot come,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, standing and not asking his visitor to sit down.",anger
487,Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he was beginning a suit for divorce.,sadness
488,But he had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan Arkadyevitch.,joy
489,"Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear, shining eyes.",joy
490,“Why can’t you?,anger
491,"What do you mean?” he asked in perplexity, speaking in French.",anger
492,"“Oh, but it’s a promise.",joy
493,"And we’re all counting on you.” “I want to tell you that I can’t dine at your house, because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease.” “How?",anger
494,How do you mean?,anger
495,What for?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile.,joy
496,"“Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister, my wife.",anger
497,"I ought to have....” But, before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence, Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected.",anger
498,He groaned and sank into an armchair.,anger
499,"“No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!",anger
500,"What are you saying?” cried Oblonsky, and his suffering was apparent in his face.",sadness
501,"“It is so.” “Excuse me, I can’t, I can’t believe it!” Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated, and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position, and that, whatever explanations he might make, his relations with his brother-in-law would remain unchanged.",sadness
502,"“Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce,” he said.",anger
503,"“I will say one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
504,"I know you for an excellent, upright man; I know Anna—excuse me, I can’t change my opinion of her—for a good, an excellent woman; and so, excuse me, I cannot believe it.",joy
505,"There is some misunderstanding,” said he.",anger
506,"“Oh, if it were merely a misunderstanding!...” “Pardon, I understand,” interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
507,“But of course.... One thing: you must not act in haste.,anger
508,"You must not, you must not act in haste!” “I am not acting in haste,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, “but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter.",anger
509,I have quite made up my mind.” “This is awful!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.,sadness
510,"“I would do one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
511,"I beseech you, do it!” he said.",anger
512,"“No action has yet been taken, if I understand rightly.",anger
513,"Before you take advice, see my wife, talk to her.",anger
514,"She loves Anna like a sister, she loves you, and she’s a wonderful woman.",joy
515,"For God’s sake, talk to her!",anger
516,"Do me that favor, I beseech you!” Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him sympathetically, without interrupting his silence.",anger
517,“You will go to see her?” “I don’t know.,anger
518,That was just why I have not been to see you.,anger
519,I imagine our relations must change.” “Why so?,anger
520,I don’t see that.,anger
521,"Allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly feeling I have always had for you ... and sincere esteem,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing his hand.",joy
522,"“Even if your worst suppositions were correct, I don’t—and never would—take on myself to judge either side, and I see no reason why our relations should be affected.",anger
523,"But now, do this, come and see my wife.” “Well, we look at the matter differently,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly.",anger
524,"“However, we won’t discuss it.” “No; why shouldn’t you come today to dine, anyway?",anger
525,My wife’s expecting you.,anger
526,"Please, do come.",joy
527,"And, above all, talk it over with her.",anger
528,She’s a wonderful woman.,joy
529,"For God’s sake, on my knees, I implore you!” “If you so much wish it, I will come,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sighing.",anger
530,"And, anxious to change the conversation, he inquired about what interested them both—the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s department, a man not yet old, who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position.",fear
531,"Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count Anitchkin, and had always differed from him in his opinions.",joy
532,"But now, from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials—that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion, he could not endure him.",sadness
533,"“Well, have you seen him?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a malignant smile.",anger
534,“Of course; he was at our sitting yesterday.,anger
535,"He seems to know his work capitally, and to be very energetic.” “Yes, but what is his energy directed to?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
536,"“Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what’s been done?",anger
537,"It’s the great misfortune of our government—this paper administration, of which he’s a worthy representative.” “Really, I don’t know what fault one could find with him.",anger
538,"His policy I don’t know, but one thing—he’s a very nice fellow,” answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
539,"“I’ve just been seeing him, and he’s really a capital fellow.",anger
540,"We lunched together, and I taught him how to make, you know that drink, wine and oranges.",anger
541,It’s so cooling.,anger
542,And it’s a wonder he didn’t know it.,joy
543,He liked it awfully.,anger
544,"No, really he’s a capital fellow.” Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch.",anger
545,"“Why, good heavens, it’s four already, and I’ve still to go to Dolgovushin’s!",joy
546,So please come round to dinner.,anger
547,You can’t imagine how you will grieve my wife and me.” The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother-in-law out was very different from the manner in which he had met him.,anger
548,"“I’ve promised, and I’ll come,” he answered wearily.",joy
549,"“Believe me, I appreciate it, and I hope you won’t regret it,” answered Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",joy
550,"And, putting on his coat as he went, he patted the footman on the head, chuckled, and went out.",anger
551,"“At five o’clock, and not evening dress, please,” he shouted once more, turning at the door.",anger
552,"It was past five, and several guests had already arrived, before the host himself got home.",anger
553,"He went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev and Pestsov, who had reached the street door at the same moment.",anger
554,"These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow intellectuals, as Oblonsky had called them.",anger
555,Both were men respected for their character and their intelligence.,joy
556,"They respected each other, but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject, not because they belonged to opposite parties, but precisely because they were of the same party (their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views); but, in that party, each had his own special shade of opinion.",joy
557,"And since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions, they never agreed in any opinion, and had long, indeed, been accustomed to jeer without anger, each at the other’s incorrigible aberrations.",anger
558,"They were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when Stepan Arkadyevitch overtook them.",anger
559,"In the drawing-room there were already sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky, young Shtcherbatsky, Turovtsin, Kitty, and Karenin.",joy
560,Stepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing-room without him.,anger
561,"Darya Alexandrovna, in her best gray silk gown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her husband’s absence, was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him.",anger
562,"All were sitting like so many priests’ wives on a visit (so the old prince expressed it), obviously wondering why they were there, and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent.",sadness
563,"Turovtsin—good, simple man—felt unmistakably a fish out of water, and the smile with which his thick lips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said, as plainly as words: “Well, old boy, you have popped me down in a learned set!",joy
564,"A drinking party now, or the _Château des Fleurs_, would be more in my line!” The old prince sat in silence, his bright little eyes watching Karenin from one side, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon.",joy
565,"Kitty was looking at the door, calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin.",anger
566,"Young Shtcherbatsky, who had not been introduced to Karenin, was trying to look as though he were not in the least conscious of it.",joy
567,Karenin himself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a white tie.,joy
568,"Stepan Arkadyevitch saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise, and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering.",anger
569,He was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in.,joy
570,"On entering the drawing-room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized, explaining that he had been detained by that prince, who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities, and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other, and, bringing together Alexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev, started them on a discussion of the Russification of Poland, into which they immediately plunged with Pestsov.",joy
571,"Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder, he whispered something comic in his ear, and set him down by his wife and the old prince.",anger
572,"Then he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening, and presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin.",joy
573,"In a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing-room became very lively, and there was a merry buzz of voices.",joy
574,Konstantin Levin was the only person who had not arrived.,anger
575,"But this was so much the better, as going into the dining-room, Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from Depré, and not from Levy, and, directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy’s, he was going back to the drawing-room.",anger
576,In the dining-room he was met by Konstantin Levin.,anger
577,"“I’m not late?” “You can never help being late!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking his arm.",anger
578,“Have you a lot of people?,anger
579,"Who’s here?” asked Levin, unable to help blushing, as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove.",fear
580,“All our own set.,joy
581,Kitty’s here.,joy
582,"Come along, I’ll introduce you to Karenin.” Stepan Arkadyevitch, for all his liberal views, was well aware that to meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, and so treated his best friends to this honor.",joy
583,But at that instant Konstantin Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance.,joy
584,"He had not seen Kitty since that memorable evening when he met Vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad.",joy
585,He had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today.,joy
586,"But to keep his thoughts free, he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it.",joy
587,"Now when he heard that she was here, he was suddenly conscious of such delight, and at the same time of such dread, that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say.",sadness
588,"“What is she like, what is she like?",anger
589,"Like what she used to be, or like what she was in the carriage?",anger
590,What if Darya Alexandrovna told the truth?,anger
591,Why shouldn’t it be the truth?” he thought.,anger
592,"“Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin,” he brought out with an effort, and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing-room and beheld her.",anger
593,"She was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had been in the carriage; she was quite different.",anger
594,"She was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it.",joy
595,She saw him the very instant he walked into the room.,anger
596,She had been expecting him.,anger
597,"She was delighted, and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment, the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her, when she, and he, and Dolly, who saw it all, thought she would break down and would begin to cry.",fear
598,"She crimsoned, turned white, crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her.",fear
599,"He went up to her, bowed, and held out his hand without speaking.",anger
600,"Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm as she said: “How long it is since we’ve seen each other!” and with desperate determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand.",anger
601,"“You’ve not seen me, but I’ve seen you,” said Levin, with a radiant smile of happiness.",joy
602,"“I saw you when you were driving from the railway station to Ergushovo.” “When?” she asked, wondering.",fear
603,"“You were driving to Ergushovo,” said Levin, feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart.",sadness
604,“And how dared I associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature?,joy
605,"And, yes, I do believe it’s true what Darya Alexandrovna told me,” he thought.",anger
606,Stepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin.,anger
607,“Let me introduce you.” He mentioned their names.,anger
608,"“Very glad to meet you again,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly, shaking hands with Levin.",joy
609,“You are acquainted?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise.,joy
610,"“We spent three hours together in the train,” said Levin smiling, “but got out, just as in a masquerade, quite mystified—at least I was.” “Nonsense!",anger
611,"Come along, please,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing in the direction of the dining-room.",joy
612,"The men went into the dining-room and went up to a table, laid with six sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese, some with little silver spades and some without, caviar, herrings, preserves of various kinds, and plates with slices of French bread.",anger
613,"The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies, and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev, Karenin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner.",joy
614,Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent.,joy
615,He did this now.,anger
616,Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of Poland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which ought to be introduced by the Russian government.,anger
617,Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is the more densely populated.,joy
618,"Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations.",joy
619,"As they were going out of the drawing-room to conclude the argument, Koznishev said, smiling: “So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is but one method—to bring up as many children as one can.",anger
620,"My brother and I are terribly in fault, I see.",anger
621,"You married men, especially you, Stepan Arkadyevitch, are the real patriots: what number have you reached?” he said, smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine-glass to him.",anger
622,"Everyone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor.",joy
623,"“Oh, yes, that’s the best method!” he said, munching cheese and filling the wine-glass with a special sort of spirit.",joy
624,The conversation dropped at the jest.,anger
625,“This cheese is not bad.,sadness
626,Shall I give you some?” said the master of the house.,anger
627,"“Why, have you been going in for gymnastics again?” he asked Levin, pinching his muscle with his left hand.",anger
628,"Levin smiled, bent his arm, and under Stepan Arkadyevitch’s fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese, hard as a knob of iron, through the fine cloth of the coat.",joy
629,“What biceps!,joy
630,"A perfect Samson!” “I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears,” observed Alexey Alexandrovitch, who had the mistiest notions about the chase.",joy
631,He cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider-web.,joy
632,Levin smiled.,joy
633,“Not at all.,anger
634,"Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear,” he said, with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were approaching the table.",anger
635,"“You have killed a bear, I’ve been told!” said Kitty, trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away, and setting the lace quivering over her white arm.",fear
636,"“Are there bears on your place?” she added, turning her charming little head to him and smiling.",joy
637,"There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, in every turn of her lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it!",anger
638,"There was entreaty for forgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness—soft, timid tenderness—and promise and hope and love for him, which he could not but believe in and which choked him with happiness.",fear
639,"“No, we’ve been hunting in the Tver province.",anger
640,"It was coming back from there that I met your _beau-frère_ in the train, or your _beau-frère’s_ brother-in-law,” he said with a smile.",joy
641,"“It was an amusing meeting.” And he began telling with droll good-humor how, after not sleeping all night, he had, wearing an old fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got into Alexey Alexandrovitch’s compartment.",joy
642,"“The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out on account of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in elevated language, and ... you, too,” he said, addressing Karenin and forgetting his name, “at first would have ejected me on the ground of the old coat, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am extremely grateful.” “The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too ill-defined,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief.",joy
643,"“I saw you were in uncertainty about me,” said Levin, smiling good-naturedly, “but I made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.” Sergey Ivanovitch, while he kept up a conversation with their hostess, had one ear for his brother, and he glanced askance at him.",anger
644,“What is the matter with him today?,anger
645,Why such a conquering hero?” he thought.,anger
646,He did not know that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings.,joy
647,Levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him.,joy
648,And this was the only thing that interested him.,anger
649,"Not in that room only, but in the whole world, there existed for him only himself, with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes, and she.",joy
650,"He felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy, and far away down below were all those nice excellent Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the world.",joy
651,"Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though there were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and Kitty side by side.",anger
652,"“Oh, you may as well sit there,” he said to Levin.",anger
653,"The dinner was as choice as the china, in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was a connoisseur.",anger
654,The _soupe Marie-Louise_ was a splendid success; the tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable.,joy
655,"The two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly.",joy
656,On the material side the dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial.,anger
657,"The conversation, at times general and at times between individuals, never paused, and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table, without stopping speaking, and even Alexey Alexandrovitch thawed.",joy
658,"Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end, and was not satisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch’s words, especially as he felt the injustice of his view.",anger
659,"“I did not mean,” he said over the soup, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, “mere density of population alone, but in conjunction with fundamental ideas, and not by means of principles.” “It seems to me,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly, and with no haste, “that that’s the same thing.",joy
660,"In my opinion, influence over another people is only possible to the people which has the higher development, which....” “But that’s just the question,” Pestsov broke in in his bass.",anger
661,"He was always in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put his whole soul into what he was saying.",anger
662,“In what are we to make higher development consist?,joy
663,"The English, the French, the Germans, which is at the highest stage of development?",anger
664,Which of them will nationalize the other?,anger
665,"We see the Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at a lower stage!” he shouted.",anger
666,"“There is another law at work there.” “I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, slightly lifting his eyebrows.",joy
667,“But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization?” said Pestsov.,joy
668,"“I imagine such signs are generally very well known,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
669,“But are they fully known?” Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile.,joy
670,"“It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor.” “You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
671,Will you take red wine?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
672,"“I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture,” Sergey Ivanovitch said, holding out his glass with a smile of condescension, as to a child.",joy
673,"“I only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them,” he went on, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
674,"“My sympathies are classical from education, but in this discussion I am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion.",joy
675,"I see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies.” “The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,” put in Pestsov.",joy
676,"“Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of general principles.” “I cannot quite agree with that,” responded Alexey Alexandrovitch “It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development.",joy
677,"Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately, with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.” Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass.",sadness
678,He began warmly contesting the justice of this view.,joy
679,"Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a convincing reply ready.",joy
680,"“But,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin, “One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral—_disons le mot_—anti-nihilist influence.” “Undoubtedly.” “If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,” said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, “we should have given elbow-room to both tendencies.",joy
681,"But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and we boldly prescribe them to our patients....",joy
682,But what if they had no such medicinal property?” he wound up humorously.,anger
683,"At Sergey Ivanovitch’s little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found something to laugh at, all he ever looked for in listening to conversation.",anger
684,Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov.,joy
685,With Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant.,joy
686,"Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest, Pestsov promptly started a new one.",anger
687,"“I can’t agree even,” said he, “that the government had that aim.",anger
688,"The government obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise.",anger
689,"The education of women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.” And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women.",anger
690,"Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous.",anger
691,"“I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably connected together,” said Pestsov; “it is a vicious circle.",anger
692,"Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education results from the absence of rights.",sadness
693,"We must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us,” said he.",anger
694,"“You said rights,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had finished, “meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil service, of sitting in parliament....” “Undoubtedly.” “But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression ‘rights.’ It would be more correct to say duties.",anger
695,"Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing duties.",joy
696,"And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties, and quite legitimately.",joy
697,"And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man.” “Quite so,” Alexey Alexandrovitch assented.",sadness
698,"“The question, I imagine, is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.” “They will most likely be perfectly fitted,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “when education has become general among them.",joy
699,"We see this....” “How about the proverb?” said the prince, who had a long while been intent on the conversation, his little comical eyes twinkling.",anger
700,"“I can say it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is....” “Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!” said Pestsov angrily.",anger
701,"“What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, “while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to avoid them.” “Duties are bound up with rights—power, money, honor; those are what women are seeking,” said Pestsov.",anger
702,"“Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take me,” said the old prince.",anger
703,Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch regretted that he had not made this comparison.,anger
704,Even Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled.,joy
705,"“Yes, but a man can’t nurse a baby,” said Pestsov, “while a woman....” “No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship,” said the old prince, feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters.",joy
706,"“There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
707,"“Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?” put in Stepan Arkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he had had in his mind all along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him.",love
708,"“If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she had abandoned a family—her own or a sister’s, where she might have found a woman’s duties,” Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation, probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevitch was thinking of.",anger
709,"“But we take our stand on principle as the ideal,” replied Pestsov in his mellow bass.",joy
710,"“Woman desires to have rights, to be independent, educated.",joy
711,"She is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities.” “And I’m oppressed and humiliated that they won’t engage me at the Foundling,” the old prince said again, to the huge delight of Turovtsin, who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce.",sadness
712,Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin.,anger
713,"At first, when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another, there rose to Levin’s mind what he had to say on the subject.",anger
714,"But these ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come into his brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest for him.",sadness
715,It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone.,anger
716,"Kitty, too, should, one would have supposed, have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women.",anger
717,"How often she had mused on the subject, thinking of her friend abroad, Varenka, of her painful state of dependence, how often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did not marry, and how often she had argued with her sister about it!",anger
718,But it did not interest her at all.,anger
719,"She and Levin had a conversation of their own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of mysterious communication, which brought them every moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering.",joy
720,"At first Levin, in answer to Kitty’s question how he could have seen her last year in the carriage, told her how he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her.",anger
721,"“It was very, very early in the morning.",joy
722,You were probably only just awake.,joy
723,Your mother was asleep in the corner.,fear
724,It was an exquisite morning.,joy
725,I was walking along wondering who it could be in a four-in-hand?,anger
726,"It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a second you flashed by, and I saw you at the window—you were sitting like this, holding the strings of your cap in both hands, and thinking awfully deeply about something,” he said, smiling.",joy
727,“How I should like to know what you were thinking about then!,anger
728,"Something important?” “Wasn’t I dreadfully untidy?” she wondered, but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the impression she had made had been very good.",joy
729,"She blushed and laughed with delight; “Really I don’t remember.” “How nicely Turovtsin laughs!” said Levin, admiring his moist eyes and shaking chest.",fear
730,“Have you known him long?” asked Kitty.,anger
731,"“Oh, everyone knows him!” “And I see you think he’s a horrid man?” “Not horrid, but nothing in him.” “Oh, you’re wrong!",anger
732,And you must give up thinking so directly!” said Kitty.,anger
733,"“I used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, he’s an awfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man.",joy
734,He has a heart of gold.” “How could you find out what sort of heart he has?” “We are great friends.,joy
735,I know him very well.,joy
736,"Last winter, soon after ... you came to see us,” she said, with a guilty and at the same time confiding smile, “all Dolly’s children had scarlet fever, and he happened to come and see her.",sadness
737,"And only fancy,” she said in a whisper, “he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look after the children.",sadness
738,"Yes, and for three weeks he stopped with them, and looked after the children like a nurse.” “I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet fever,” she said, bending over to her sister.",anger
739,"“Yes, it was wonderful, noble!” said Dolly, glancing towards Turovtsin, who had become aware they were talking of him, and smiling gently to him.",joy
740,"Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin, and wondered how it was he had not realized all this man’s goodness before.",joy
741,"“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, and I’ll never think ill of people again!” he said gaily, genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment.",sadness
742,Connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies.,anger
743,"Pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions, but Sergey Ivanovitch and Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them.",anger
744,"When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out, Pestsov did not follow them, but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, began to expound the chief ground of inequality.",anger
745,"The inequality in marriage, in his opinion, lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the infidelity of the husband are punished unequally, both by the law and by public opinion.",anger
746,Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and offered him a cigar.,anger
747,"“No, I don’t smoke,” Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly, and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject, he turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.",joy
748,"“I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things,” he said, and would have gone on to the drawing-room.",anger
749,"But at this point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
750,"“You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?” said Turovtsin, warmed up by the champagne he had drunk, and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him.",anger
751,"“Vasya Pryatchnikov,” he said, with a good-natured smile on his damp, red lips, addressing himself principally to the most important guest, Alexey Alexandrovitch, “they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver, and has killed him.” Just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place, so Stepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s sore spot.",sadness
752,"He would again have got his brother-in-law away, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself inquired, with curiosity: “What did Pryatchnikov fight about?” “His wife.",anger
753,"Acted like a man, he did!",anger
754,"Called him out and shot him!” “Ah!” said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, and lifting his eyebrows, he went into the drawing-room.",anger
755,"“How glad I am you have come,” Dolly said with a frightened smile, meeting him in the outer drawing-room.",fear
756,“I must talk to you.,anger
757,"Let’s sit here.” Alexey Alexandrovitch, with the same expression of indifference, given him by his lifted eyebrows, sat down beside Darya Alexandrovna, and smiled affectedly.",anger
758,"“It’s fortunate,” said he, “especially as I was meaning to ask you to excuse me, and to be taking leave.",joy
759,"I have to start tomorrow.” Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna’s innocence, and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid, unfeeling man, who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend.",anger
760,"“Alexey Alexandrovitch,” she said, with desperate resolution looking him in the face, “I asked you about Anna, you made me no answer.",anger
761,"How is she?” “She is, I believe, quite well, Darya Alexandrovna,” replied Alexey Alexandrovitch, not looking at her.",anger
762,"“Alexey Alexandrovitch, forgive me, I have no right ... but I love Anna as a sister, and esteem her; I beg, I beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you?",anger
763,"what fault do you find with her?” Alexey Alexandrovitch frowned, and almost closing his eyes, dropped his head.",anger
764,"“I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I consider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna?” he said, not looking her in the face, but eyeing with displeasure Shtcherbatsky, who was walking across the drawing-room.",anger
765,"“I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” Dolly said, clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture.",joy
766,"She rose quickly, and laid her hand on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s sleeve.",anger
767,“We shall be disturbed here.,anger
768,"Come this way, please.” Dolly’s agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
769,He got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom.,anger
770,They sat down to a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.,anger
771,"“I don’t, I don’t believe it!” Dolly said, trying to catch his glance that avoided her.",anger
772,"“One cannot disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna,” said he, with an emphasis on the word “facts.” “But what has she done?” said Darya Alexandrovna.",anger
773,"“What precisely has she done?” “She has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband.",sadness
774,"That’s what she has done,” said he.",anger
775,"“No, no, it can’t be!",anger
776,"No, for God’s sake, you are mistaken,” said Dolly, putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes.",joy
777,"Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly, with his lips alone, meaning to signify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction; but this warm defense, though it could not shake him, reopened his wound.",anger
778,He began to speak with greater heat.,anger
779,"“It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact—informs him that eight years of her life, and a son, all that’s a mistake, and that she wants to begin life again,” he said angrily, with a snort.",anger
780,"“Anna and sin—I cannot connect them, I cannot believe it!” “Darya Alexandrovna,” he said, now looking straight into Dolly’s kindly, troubled face, and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself, “I would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible.",joy
781,"When I doubted, I was miserable, but it was better than now.",anger
782,"When I doubted, I had hope; but now there is no hope, and still I doubt of everything.",joy
783,"I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my son, and sometimes do not believe he is my son.",anger
784,I am very unhappy.” He had no need to say that.,sadness
785,"Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face; and she felt sorry for him, and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to totter.",sadness
786,"“Oh, this is awful, awful!",sadness
787,But can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce?” “I am resolved on extreme measures.,anger
788,"There is nothing else for me to do.” “Nothing else to do, nothing else to do....” she replied, with tears in her eyes.",sadness
789,"“Oh no, don’t say nothing else to do!” she said.",joy
790,"“What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot, as in any other—in loss, in death—bear one’s trouble in peace, but that one must act,” said he, as though guessing her thought.",anger
791,"“One must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed; one can’t live _à trois_.” “I understand, I quite understand that,” said Dolly, and her head sank.",anger
792,"She was silent for a little, thinking of herself, of her own grief in her family, and all at once, with an impulsive movement, she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture.",anger
793,“But wait a little!,joy
794,You are a Christian.,anger
795,Think of her!,anger
796,"What will become of her, if you cast her off?” “I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, I have thought a great deal,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
797,"His face turned red in patches, and his dim eyes looked straight before him.",anger
798,Darya Alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart.,sadness
799,“That was what I did indeed when she herself made known to me my humiliation; I left everything as of old.,sadness
800,"I gave her a chance to reform, I tried to save her.",anger
801,And with what result?,joy
802,"She would not regard the slightest request—that she should observe decorum,” he said, getting heated.",anger
803,"“One may save anyone who does not want to be ruined; but if the whole nature is so corrupt, so depraved, that ruin itself seems to be her salvation, what’s to be done?” “Anything, only not divorce!” answered Darya Alexandrovna “But what is anything?” “No, it is awful!",sadness
804,"She will be no one’s wife, she will be lost!” “What can I do?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his shoulders and his eyebrows.",joy
805,"The recollection of his wife’s last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid, as at the beginning of the conversation.",anger
806,"“I am very grateful for your sympathy, but I must be going,” he said, getting up.",joy
807,"“No, wait a minute.",joy
808,You must not ruin her.,anger
809,Wait a little; I will tell you about myself.,anger
810,"I was married, and my husband deceived me; in anger and jealousy, I would have thrown up everything, I would myself....",anger
811,But I came to myself again; and who did it?,anger
812,Anna saved me.,anger
813,And here I am living on.,anger
814,"The children are growing up, my husband has come back to his family, and feels his fault, is growing purer, better, and I live on....",joy
815,"I have forgiven it, and you ought to forgive!” Alexey Alexandrovitch heard her, but her words had no effect on him now.",anger
816,All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul.,anger
817,"He shook himself, and said in a shrill, loud voice: “Forgive I cannot, and do not wish to, and I regard it as wrong.",anger
818,"I have done everything for this woman, and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is akin.",anger
819,"I am not a spiteful man, I have never hated anyone, but I hate her with my whole soul, and I cannot even forgive her, because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me!” he said, with tones of hatred in his voice.",anger
820,“Love those that hate you....” Darya Alexandrovna whispered timorously.,anger
821,Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously.,joy
822,"That he knew long ago, but it could not be applied to his case.",anger
823,"“Love those that hate you, but to love those one hates is impossible.",anger
824,Forgive me for having troubled you.,anger
825,"Everyone has enough to bear in his own grief!” And regaining his self-possession, Alexey Alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away.",sadness
826,"When they rose from table, Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into the drawing-room; but he was afraid she might dislike this, as too obviously paying her attention.",anger
827,"He remained in the little ring of men, taking part in the general conversation, and without looking at Kitty, he was aware of her movements, her looks, and the place where she was in the drawing-room.",anger
828,"He did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise he had made her—always to think well of all men, and to like everyone always.",joy
829,"The conversation fell on the village commune, in which Pestsov saw a sort of special principle, called by him the “choral” principle.",anger
830,"Levin did not agree with Pestsov, nor with his brother, who had a special attitude of his own, both admitting and not admitting the significance of the Russian commune.",joy
831,"But he talked to them, simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences.",anger
832,"He was not in the least interested in what he said himself, and even less so in what they said; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented.",joy
833,"He knew now the one thing of importance; and that one thing was at first there, in the drawing-room, and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door.",anger
834,"Without turning round he felt the eyes fixed on him, and the smile, and he could not help turning round.",joy
835,"She was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky, looking at him.",anger
836,"“I thought you were going towards the piano,” said he, going up to her.",anger
837,"“That’s something I miss in the country—music.” “No; we only came to fetch you and thank you,” she said, rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift, “for coming.",joy
838,What do they want to argue for?,anger
839,"No one ever convinces anyone, you know.” “Yes; that’s true,” said Levin; “it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can’t make out what one’s opponent wants to prove.” Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to both, but that they liked different things, and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked.",anger
840,"He had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too, and immediately he found himself agreeing, and then all arguments fell away as useless.",sadness
841,"Sometimes, too, he had experienced the opposite, expressing at last what he liked himself, which he was devising arguments to defend, and, chancing to express it well and genuinely, he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position.",anger
842,He tried to say this.,anger
843,"She knitted her brow, trying to understand.",anger
844,"But directly he began to illustrate his meaning, she understood at once.",anger
845,"“I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious to him, then one can....” She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea.",joy
846,"Levin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the confused, verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this laconic, clear, almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas.",anger
847,"Shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a card-table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth.",joy
848,They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner—the liberty and occupations of women.,anger
849,Levin was of the opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman’s duties in a family.,anger
850,"He supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are and must be nurses, either relations or hired.",anger
851,"“No,” said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more boldly with her truthful eyes; “a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation, while she herself....” At the hint he understood her.",joy
852,"“Oh, yes,” he said.",anger
853,"“Yes, yes, yes—you’re right; you’re right!” And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid’s existence and its humiliation in Kitty’s heart; and loving her, he felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his arguments.",love
854,A silence followed.,anger
855,She was still drawing with the chalk on the table.,anger
856,Her eyes were shining with a soft light.,joy
857,Under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness.,joy
858,“Ah!,anger
859,"I’ve scribbled all over the table!” she said, and, laying down the chalk, she made a movement as though to get up.",anger
860,“What!,anger
861,"shall I be left alone—without her?” he thought with horror, and he took the chalk.",anger
862,"“Wait a minute,” he said, sitting down to the table.",anger
863,"“I’ve long wanted to ask you one thing.” He looked straight into her caressing, though frightened eyes.",fear
864,"“Please, ask it.” “Here,” he said; and he wrote the initial letters, _w, y, t, m, i, c, n, b, d, t, m, n, o, t_.",joy
865,"These letters meant, “When you told me it could never be, did that mean never, or then?” There seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence; but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words.",anger
866,"She glanced at him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read.",anger
867,"Once or twice she stole a look at him, as though asking him, “Is it what I think?” “I understand,” she said, flushing a little.",anger
868,"“What is this word?” he said, pointing to the _n_ that stood for _never_.",anger
869,"“It means _never_,” she said; “but that’s not true!” He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and stood up.",anger
870,"She wrote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_.",anger
871,"Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her.",joy
872,He was suddenly radiant: he had understood.,joy
873,"It meant, “Then I could not answer differently.” He glanced at her questioningly, timidly.",anger
874,"“Only then?” “Yes,” her smile answered.",joy
875,“And n... and now?” he asked.,anger
876,"“Well, read this.",anger
877,"I’ll tell you what I should like—should like so much!” she wrote the initial letters, _i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h._ This meant, “If you could forget and forgive what happened.” He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it, wrote the initial letters of the following phrase, “I have nothing to forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.” She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.",sadness
878,"“I understand,” she said in a whisper.",anger
879,He sat down and wrote a long phrase.,anger
880,"She understood it all, and without asking him, “Is it this?” took the chalk and at once answered.",anger
881,"For a long while he could not understand what she had written, and often looked into her eyes.",anger
882,He was stupefied with happiness.,joy
883,"He could not supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming with happiness, he saw all he needed to know.",joy
884,And he wrote three letters.,anger
885,"But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm, and herself finished and wrote the answer, “Yes.” “You’re playing _secrétaire_?” said the old prince.",anger
886,“But we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.” Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.,anger
887,"In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that she loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning.",joy
888,"When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness without her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of death, of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her.",anger
889,"It was essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be left alone, to kill time.",anger
890,"Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the companion most congenial to him, but he was going out, he said, to a _soirée_, in reality to the ballet.",joy
891,"Levin only had time to tell him he was happy, and that he loved him, and would never, never forget what he had done for him.",joy
892,The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed Levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly.,joy
893,"“Oh, so it’s not time to die yet?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing Levin’s hand with emotion.",anger
894,“N-n-no!” said Levin.,anger
895,"Darya Alexandrovna too, as she said good-bye to him, gave him a sort of congratulation, saying, “How glad I am you have met Kitty again!",joy
896,One must value old friends.” Levin did not like these words of Darya Alexandrovna’s.,anger
897,"She could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was, and she ought not to have dared to allude to it.",anger
898,"Levin said good-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he attached himself to his brother.",anger
899,"“Where are you going?” “I’m going to a meeting.” “Well, I’ll come with you.",anger
900,May I?” “What for?,anger
901,"Yes, come along,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling.",joy
902,“What is the matter with you today?” “With me?,anger
903,"Happiness is the matter with me!” said Levin, letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in.",anger
904,“You don’t mind?—it’s so stifling.,joy
905,It’s happiness is the matter with me!,anger
906,Why is it you have never married?” Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.,anger
907,"“I am very glad, she seems a nice gi....” Sergey Ivanovitch was beginning.",joy
908,“Don’t say it!,anger
909,"don’t say it!” shouted Levin, clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands, and muffling him up in it.",anger
910,"“She’s a nice girl” were such simple, humble words, so out of harmony with his feeling.",joy
911,"Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare with him.",anger
912,"“Well, anyway, I may say that I’m very glad of it.” “That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more!",joy
913,"Nothing, nothing, silence,” said Levin, and muffling him once more in his fur coat, he added: “I do like you so!",sadness
914,"Well, is it possible for me to be present at the meeting?” “Of course it is.” “What is your discussion about today?” asked Levin, never ceasing smiling.",joy
915,They arrived at the meeting.,anger
916,"Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but Levin saw from this secretary’s face what a good, nice, kind-hearted person he was.",anger
917,This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes.,sadness
918,Then the discussion began.,anger
919,"They were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes, and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said something at great length with an air of triumph; and another member, scribbling something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully.",joy
920,"And then Sviazhsky (he was there too) said something too, very handsomely and nobly.",anger
921,"Levin listened to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real, and that they were not at all angry, but were all the nicest, kindest people, and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them.",joy
922,"They did no harm to anyone, and were all enjoying it.",joy
923,"What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today, and from little, almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each, and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart.",joy
924,And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day.,love
925,"That was evident from the way they spoke to him, from the friendly, affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him.",anger
926,"“Well, did you like it?” Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.",anger
927,“Very much.,joy
928,I never supposed it was so interesting!,joy
929,Capital!,anger
930,Splendid!” Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with him.,joy
931,"Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him.",anger
932,He was a clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.,joy
933,"“Most delighted,” he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law.",joy
934,"And from a queer association of ideas, because in his imagination the idea of Sviazhsky’s sister-in-law was connected with marriage, it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness, and he was very glad to go and see them.",joy
935,"Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate, presupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least annoy Levin.",anger
936,"On the contrary, he felt that Sviazhsky was right, that the whole business was of little value, and he saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view.",joy
937,The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly delightful.,joy
938,"It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him, saying nothing merely from delicacy.",anger
939,"He stayed with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of subjects but the one thing that filled his heart, and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully, and that it was long past their bedtime.",sadness
940,"Sviazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in.",anger
941,It was past one o’clock.,anger
942,"Levin went back to his hotel, and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through.",anger
943,"The servant, whose turn it was to be up all night, lighted his candles, and would have gone away, but Levin stopped him.",anger
944,"This servant, Yegor, whom Levin had noticed before, struck him as a very intelligent, excellent, and, above all, good-hearted man.",joy
945,"“Well, Yegor, it’s hard work not sleeping, isn’t it?” “One’s got to put up with it!",anger
946,"It’s part of our work, you see.",anger
947,"In a gentleman’s house it’s easier; but then here one makes more.” It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a sempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler’s shop.",anger
948,"Levin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his opinion, in marriage the great thing was love, and that with love one would always be happy, for happiness rests only on oneself.",joy
949,"Yegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin’s idea, but by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin’s surprise, the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer, though he was a Frenchman.",joy
950,“Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!” thought Levin.,anger
951,"“Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your wife?” “Ay!",anger
952,and why not?” responded Yegor.,anger
953,And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions.,joy
954,"“My life, too, has been a wonderful one.",joy
955,"From a child up....” he was beginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin’s enthusiasm, just as people catch yawning.",sadness
956,But at that moment a ring was heard.,anger
957,"Yegor departed, and Levin was left alone.",sadness
958,"He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had refused tea and supper at Sviazhsky’s, but he was incapable of thinking of supper.",anger
959,"He had not slept the previous night, but was incapable of thinking of sleep either.",anger
960,"His room was cold, but he was oppressed by heat.",anger
961,He opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes.,anger
962,"Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains, and above it the rising triangle of Charles’s Wain with the yellowish light of Capella.",anger
963,"He gazed at the cross, then at the stars, drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room, and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination.",joy
964,At four o’clock he heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door.,anger
965,"It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he knew, coming from the club.",anger
966,"He walked gloomily, frowning and coughing.",anger
967,"“Poor, unlucky fellow!” thought Levin, and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man.",anger
968,"He would have talked with him, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross, silent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow star.",anger
969,"At seven o’clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors, and bells ringing in some servants’ department, and Levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen.",sadness
970,"He closed the pane, washed, dressed, and went out into the street.",anger
971,The streets were still empty.,sadness
972,Levin went to the house of the Shtcherbatskys.,anger
973,The visitors’ doors were closed and everything was asleep.,fear
974,"He walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee.",anger
975,"The day servant, not Yegor this time, brought it to him.",anger
976,"Levin would have entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the servant, and he went out.",anger
977,"Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll.",anger
978,"Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his coat and went out again for a walk.",anger
979,It was nine o’clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys’ steps the second time.,anger
980,"In the house they were only just up, and the cook came out to go marketing.",anger
981,He had to get through at least two hours more.,anger
982,"All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life.",joy
983,"He had eaten nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two nights, had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply fresher and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his body; he moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he could do anything.",joy
984,"He was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house, if need be.",anger
985,"He spent the remainder of the time in the street, incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him.",anger
986,"And what he saw then, he never saw again after.",anger
987,"The children especially going to school, the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the pavement, and the little loaves covered with flour, thrust out by an unseen hand, touched him.",anger
988,"Those loaves, those doves, and those two boys were not earthly creatures.",anger
989,"It all happened at the same time: a boy ran towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of her wings, darted away, flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that quivered in the air, while from a little window there came a smell of fresh-baked bread, and the loaves were put out.",joy
990,All of this together was so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight.,joy
991,"Going a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka, he went back again to the hotel, and putting his watch before him, he sat down to wait for twelve o’clock.",anger
992,"In the next room they were talking about some sort of machines, and swindling, and coughing their morning coughs.",joy
993,They did not realize that the hand was near twelve.,anger
994,The hand reached it.,anger
995,Levin went out onto the steps.,anger
996,The sledge-drivers clearly knew all about it.,anger
997,"They crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among themselves, and offering their services.",joy
998,"Trying not to offend the other sledge drivers, and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one and told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys’.",anger
999,"The sledge-driver was splendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong, full-blooded red neck.",joy
1000,"The sledge was high and comfortable, and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after, and the horse was a good one, and tried to gallop but didn’t seem to move.",sadness
1001,"The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys’ house, and drew up at the entrance with a curve of his arm and a “Wo!” especially indicative of respect for his fare.",joy
1002,The Shtcherbatskys’ hall-porter certainly knew all about it.,joy
1003,"This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said: “Well, it’s a long while since you’ve been to see us, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!” Not only he knew all about it, but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy.",joy
1004,"Looking into his kindly old eyes, Levin realized even something new in his happiness.",joy
1005,“Are they up?” “Pray walk in!,anger
1006,"Leave it here,” said he, smiling, as Levin would have come back to take his hat.",joy
1007,That meant something.,anger
1008,“To whom shall I announce your honor?” asked the footman.,anger
1009,"The footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of footmen, a dandy, was a very kind-hearted, good fellow, and he too knew all about it.",anger
1010,“The princess ... the prince ... the young princess....” said Levin.,joy
1011,The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon.,anger
1012,"She walked across the room, and her ringlets and her face were beaming.",joy
1013,"He had only just spoken to her, when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door, and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin’s eyes, and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness.",joy
1014,"Mademoiselle Linon was in great haste, and leaving him, went out at the other door.",anger
1015,"Directly she had gone out, swift, swift light steps sounded on the parquet, and his bliss, his life, himself—what was best in himself, what he had so long sought and longed for—was quickly, so quickly approaching him.",anger
1016,"She did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen force, to float to him.",anger
1017,"He saw nothing but her clear, truthful eyes, frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart.",fear
1018,"Those eyes were shining nearer and nearer, blinding him with their light of love.",joy
1019,"She stopped still close to him, touching him.",anger
1020,Her hands rose and dropped onto his shoulders.,anger
1021,"She had done all she could—she had run up to him and given herself up entirely, shy and happy.",joy
1022,He put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that sought his kiss.,anger
1023,"She too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him all the morning.",anger
1024,"Her mother and father had consented without demur, and were happy in her happiness.",joy
1025,She had been waiting for him.,anger
1026,She wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his.,anger
1027,"She had got ready to see him alone, and had been delighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and did not know herself what she was doing.",joy
1028,"She had heard his steps and voice, and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go.",anger
1029,Mademoiselle Linon had gone away.,anger
1030,"Without thinking, without asking herself how and what, she had gone up to him, and did as she was doing.",anger
1031,"“Let us go to mamma!” she said, taking him by the hand.",anger
1032,"For a long while he could say nothing, not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word, as that every time he tried to say something, instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up.",sadness
1033,He took her hand and kissed it.,anger
1034,“Can it be true?” he said at last in a choked voice.,joy
1035,"“I can’t believe you love me, dear!” She smiled at that “dear,” and at the timidity with which he glanced at her.",anger
1036,"“Yes!” she said significantly, deliberately.",joy
1037,"“I am so happy!” Not letting go his hands, she went into the drawing-room.",joy
1038,"The princess, seeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh, and with a vigorous step Levin had not expected, ran up to him, and hugging his head, kissed him, wetting his cheeks with her tears.",sadness
1039,“So it is all settled!,joy
1040,I am glad.,joy
1041,Love her.,anger
1042,"I am glad.... Kitty!” “You’ve not been long settling things,” said the old prince, trying to seem unmoved; but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him.",sadness
1043,"“I’ve long, always wished for this!” said the prince, taking Levin by the arm and drawing him towards himself.",anger
1044,"“Even when this little feather-head fancied....” “Papa!” shrieked Kitty, and shut his mouth with her hands.",anger
1045,"“Well, I won’t!” he said.",anger
1046,"“I’m very, very ... plea... Oh, what a fool I am....” He embraced Kitty, kissed her face, her hand, her face again, and made the sign of the cross over her.",anger
1047,"And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then so little known to him, when he saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty kissed his muscular hand.",love
1048,"The princess sat in her armchair, silent and smiling; the prince sat down beside her.",anger
1049,"Kitty stood by her father’s chair, still holding his hand.",anger
1050,All were silent.,fear
1051,"The princess was the first to put everything into words, and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions.",joy
1052,And all equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.,fear
1053,“When is it to be?,anger
1054,We must have the benediction and announcement.,joy
1055,And when’s the wedding to be?,anger
1056,"What do you think, Alexander?” “Here he is,” said the old prince, pointing to Levin—“he’s the principal person in the matter.” “When?” said Levin blushing.",anger
1057,“Tomorrow.,anger
1058,"If you ask me, I should say, the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.” “Come, _mon cher_, that’s nonsense!” “Well, in a week.” “He’s quite mad.” “No, why so?” “Well, upon my word!” said the mother, smiling, delighted at this haste.",joy
1059,“How about the trousseau?” “Will there really be a trousseau and all that?” Levin thought with horror.,fear
1060,“But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that—can it spoil my happiness?,joy
1061,"Nothing can spoil it!” He glanced at Kitty, and noticed that she was not in the least, not in the very least, disturbed by the idea of the trousseau.",anger
1062,"“Then it must be all right,” he thought.",anger
1063,"“Oh, I know nothing about it; I only said what I should like,” he said apologetically.",anger
1064,"“We’ll talk it over, then.",anger
1065,The benediction and announcement can take place now.,joy
1066,"That’s very well.” The princess went up to her husband, kissed him, and would have gone away, but he kept her, embraced her, and, tenderly as a young lover, kissed her several times, smiling.",love
1067,"The old people were obviously muddled for a moment, and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter.",anger
1068,"When the prince and the princess had gone, Levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand.",anger
1069,"He was self-possessed now and could speak, and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her.",anger
1070,But he said not at all what he had to say.,anger
1071,“How I knew it would be so!,anger
1072,"I never hoped for it; and yet in my heart I was always sure,” he said.",joy
1073,“I believe that it was ordained.” “And I!” she said.,anger
1074,"“Even when....” She stopped and went on again, looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes, “Even when I thrust from me my happiness.",joy
1075,"I always loved you alone, but I was carried away.",anger
1076,I ought to tell you.... Can you forgive that?” “Perhaps it was for the best.,joy
1077,You will have to forgive me so much.,anger
1078,I ought to tell you....” This was one of the things he had meant to speak about.,anger
1079,"He had resolved from the first to tell her two things—that he was not chaste as she was, and that he was not a believer.",joy
1080,"It was agonizing, but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts.",anger
1081,"“No, not now, later!” he said.",joy
1082,"“Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me.",anger
1083,I’m not afraid of anything.,fear
1084,I want to know everything.,anger
1085,Now it is settled.” He added: “Settled that you’ll take me whatever I may be—you won’t give me up?,anger
1086,"Yes?” “Yes, yes.” Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon, who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil.",anger
1087,"Before she had gone, the servants came in with their congratulations.",joy
1088,"Then relations arrived, and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding.",joy
1089,"Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort, but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing.",sadness
1090,"He felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him—what, he did not know; and he did everything he was told, and it all gave him happiness.",joy
1091,"He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others, that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness; but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did, and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special, more and more unlike anything that had ever happened.",joy
1092,"“Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat,” said Mademoiselle Linon—and Levin drove off to buy sweetmeats.",anger
1093,"“Well, I’m very glad,” said Sviazhsky.",joy
1094,"“I advise you to get the bouquets from Fomin’s.” “Oh, are they wanted?” And he drove to Fomin’s.",anger
1095,"His brother offered to lend him money, as he would have so many expenses, presents to give.... “Oh, are presents wanted?” And he galloped to Foulde’s.",anger
1096,"And at the confectioner’s, and at Fomin’s, and at Foulde’s he saw that he was expected; that they were pleased to see him, and prided themselves on his happiness, just as everyone whom he had to do with during those days.",joy
1097,"What was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him, but even people previously unsympathetic, cold, and callous, were enthusiastic over him, gave way to him in everything, treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection.",love
1098,Kitty too felt the same thing.,sadness
1099,"When Countess Nordston ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better, Kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than Levin, that Countess Nordston had to admit it, and in Kitty’s presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration.",joy
1100,The confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time.,anger
1101,"He consulted the old prince, and with his sanction gave Kitty his diary, in which there was written the confession that tortured him.",anger
1102,He had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife.,anger
1103,Two things caused him anguish: his lack of purity and his lack of faith.,sadness
1104,His confession of unbelief passed unnoticed.,anger
1105,"She was religious, had never doubted the truths of religion, but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least.",anger
1106,"Through love she knew all his soul, and in his soul she saw what she wanted, and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account.",anger
1107,The other confession set her weeping bitterly.,anger
1108,"Levin, not without an inner struggle, handed her his diary.",sadness
1109,"He knew that between him and her there could not be, and should not be, secrets, and so he had decided that so it must be.",anger
1110,"But he had not realized what an effect it would have on her, he had not put himself in her place.",anger
1111,"It was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater, went into her room and saw her tear-stained, pitiful, sweet face, miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing could undo, he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity, and was appalled at what he had done.",sadness
1112,"“Take them, take these dreadful books!” she said, pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table.",anger
1113,“Why did you give them me?,anger
1114,"No, it was better anyway,” she added, touched by his despairing face.",sadness
1115,"“But it’s awful, awful!” His head sank, and he was silent.",sadness
1116,He could say nothing.,joy
1117,"“You can’t forgive me,” he whispered.",anger
1118,"“Yes, I forgive you; but it’s terrible!” But his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it, it only added another shade to it.",sadness
1119,"She forgave him; but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her, morally bowed down lower than ever before her, and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness.",anger
1120,"Unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner, Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his solitary room.",sadness
1121,Darya Alexandrovna’s words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance.,anger
1122,"The applicability or non-applicability of the Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly, and this question had long ago been answered by Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative.",anger
1123,"Of all that had been said, what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid, good-natured Turovtsin—“_Acted like a man, he did!",anger
1124,"Called him out and shot him!_” Everyone had apparently shared this feeling, though from politeness they had not expressed it.",joy
1125,"“But the matter is settled, it’s useless thinking about it,” Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself.",anger
1126,"And thinking of nothing but the journey before him, and the revision work he had to do, he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was.",anger
1127,The porter said that the man had only just gone out.,anger
1128,"Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him, sat down to the table, and taking the guidebook, began considering the route of his journey.",anger
1129,"“Two telegrams,” said his manservant, coming into the room.",anger
1130,"“I beg your pardon, your excellency; I’d only just that minute gone out.” Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them.",anger
1131,The first telegram was the announcement of Stremov’s appointment to the very post Karenin had coveted.,anger
1132,"Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down, and flushing a little, got up and began to pace up and down the room.",anger
1133,"“_Quos vult perdere dementat_,” he said, meaning by _quos_ the persons responsible for this appointment.",joy
1134,"He was not so much annoyed that he had not received the post, that he had been conspicuously passed over; but it was incomprehensible, amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrase-monger Stremov was the last man fit for it.",anger
1135,"How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their _prestige_ by this appointment?",anger
1136,"“Something else in the same line,” he said to himself bitterly, opening the second telegram.",anger
1137,The telegram was from his wife.,anger
1138,"Her name, written in blue pencil, “Anna,” was the first thing that caught his eye.",anger
1139,"“I am dying; I beg, I implore you to come.",anger
1140,"I shall die easier with your forgiveness,” he read.",anger
1141,"He smiled contemptuously, and flung down the telegram.",anger
1142,"That this was a trick and a fraud, of that, he thought for the first minute, there could be no doubt.",joy
1143,“There is no deceit she would stick at.,anger
1144,She was near her confinement.,anger
1145,Perhaps it is the confinement.,anger
1146,But what can be their aim?,anger
1147,"To legitimize the child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce,” he thought.",anger
1148,"“But something was said in it: I am dying....” He read the telegram again, and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him.",anger
1149,“And if it is true?” he said to himself.,anger
1150,"“If it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent, and I, taking it for a trick, refuse to go?",joy
1151,"That would not only be cruel, and everyone would blame me, but it would be stupid on my part.” “Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Petersburg,” he said to his servant.",anger
1152,Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see his wife.,anger
1153,"If her illness was a trick, he would say nothing and go away again.",anger
1154,"If she was really in danger, and wished to see him before her death, he would forgive her if he found her alive, and pay her the last duties if he came too late.",anger
1155,All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do.,anger
1156,"With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train, in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove through the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him, not thinking of what was awaiting him.",sadness
1157,"He could not think about it, because in picturing what would happen, he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position.",sadness
1158,"Bakers, closed shops, night-cabmen, porters sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes, and he watched it all, trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him, and what he dared not hope for, and yet was hoping for.",joy
1159,He drove up to the steps.,anger
1160,A sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance.,anger
1161,"As he went into the entry, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as it were, got out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain, and mastered it thoroughly.",anger
1162,"Its meaning ran: “If it’s a trick, then calm contempt and departure.",anger
1163,"If truth, do what is proper.” The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang.",anger
1164,"The porter, Kapitonitch, looked queer in an old coat, without a tie, and in slippers.",sadness
1165,“How is your mistress?” “A successful confinement yesterday.” Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white.,anger
1166,He felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death.,love
1167,“And how is she?” Korney in his morning apron ran downstairs.,anger
1168,"“Very ill,” he answered.",anger
1169,"“There was a consultation yesterday, and the doctor’s here now.” “Take my things,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death, he went into the hall.",joy
1170,On the hatstand there was a military overcoat.,anger
1171,"Alexey Alexandrovitch noticed it and asked: “Who is here?” “The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.” Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms.",anger
1172,In the drawing-room there was no one; at the sound of his steps there came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons.,anger
1173,"She went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the bedroom.",anger
1174,“Thank God you’ve come!,anger
1175,"She keeps on about you and nothing but you,” she said.",joy
1176,“Make haste with the ice!” the doctor’s peremptory voice said from the bedroom.,anger
1177,Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir.,joy
1178,"At the table, sitting sideways in a low chair, was Vronsky, his face hidden in his hands, weeping.",anger
1179,"He jumped up at the doctor’s voice, took his hands from his face, and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1180,"Seeing the husband, he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again, drawing his head down to his shoulders, as if he wanted to disappear; but he made an effort over himself, got up and said: “She is dying.",anger
1181,The doctors say there is no hope.,joy
1182,"I am entirely in your power, only let me be here ... though I am at your disposal.",joy
1183,"I....” Alexey Alexandrovitch, seeing Vronsky’s tears, felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people’s suffering, and turning away his face, he moved hurriedly to the door, without hearing the rest of his words.",fear
1184,From the bedroom came the sound of Anna’s voice saying something.,joy
1185,"Her voice was lively, eager, with exceedingly distinct intonations.",joy
1186,"Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the bedroom, and went up to the bed.",anger
1187,She was lying turned with her face towards him.,anger
1188,"Her cheeks were flushed crimson, her eyes glittered, her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt, twisting it about.",sadness
1189,"It seemed as though she were not only well and blooming, but in the happiest frame of mind.",joy
1190,"She was talking rapidly, musically, and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation.",joy
1191,"“For Alexey—I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch (what a strange and awful thing that both are Alexey, isn’t it?",fear
1192,)—Alexey would not refuse me.,anger
1193,"I should forget, he would forgive....",anger
1194,But why doesn’t he come?,anger
1195,He’s so good he doesn’t know himself how good he is.,joy
1196,"Ah, my God, what agony!",sadness
1197,"Give me some water, quick!",joy
1198,"Oh, that will be bad for her, my little girl!",anger
1199,"Oh, very well then, give her to a nurse.",anger
1200,"Yes, I agree, it’s better in fact.",joy
1201,He’ll be coming; it will hurt him to see her.,anger
1202,"Give her to the nurse.” “Anna Arkadyevna, he has come.",anger
1203,"Here he is!” said the midwife, trying to attract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1204,"“Oh, what nonsense!” Anna went on, not seeing her husband.",anger
1205,"“No, give her to me; give me my little one!",anger
1206,He has not come yet.,joy
1207,"You say he won’t forgive me, because you don’t know him.",anger
1208,No one knows him.,anger
1209,"I’m the only one, and it was hard for me even.",anger
1210,His eyes I ought to know—Seryozha has just the same eyes—and I can’t bear to see them because of it.,anger
1211,Has Seryozha had his dinner?,anger
1212,I know everyone will forget him.,anger
1213,He would not forget.,sadness
1214,"Seryozha must be moved into the corner room, and Mariette must be asked to sleep with him.” All of a sudden she shrank back, was silent; and in terror, as though expecting a blow, as though to defend herself, she raised her hands to her face.",sadness
1215,She had seen her husband.,anger
1216,"“No, no!” she began.",anger
1217,“I am not afraid of him; I am afraid of death.,fear
1218,"Alexey, come here.",joy
1219,"I am in a hurry, because I’ve no time, I’ve not long left to live; the fever will begin directly and I shall understand nothing more.",joy
1220,"Now I understand, I understand it all, I see it all!” Alexey Alexandrovitch’s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony; he took her by the hand and tried to say something, but he could not utter it; his lower lip quivered, but he still went on struggling with his emotion, and only now and then glanced at her.",sadness
1221,"And each time he glanced at her, he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them.",love
1222,"“Wait a minute, you don’t know ... stay a little, stay!...” She stopped, as though collecting her ideas.",joy
1223,"“Yes,” she began; “yes, yes, yes.",anger
1224,This is what I wanted to say.,anger
1225,Don’t be surprised at me.,surprise
1226,I’m still the same....,anger
1227,"But there is another woman in me, I’m afraid of her: she loved that man, and I tried to hate you, and could not forget about her that used to be.",anger
1228,I’m not that woman.,anger
1229,"Now I’m my real self, all myself.",joy
1230,"I’m dying now, I know I shall die, ask him.",anger
1231,"Even now I feel—see here, the weights on my feet, on my hands, on my fingers.",anger
1232,My fingers—see how huge they are!,anger
1233,"But this will soon all be over.... Only one thing I want: forgive me, forgive me quite.",anger
1234,"I’m terrible, but my nurse used to tell me; the holy martyr—what was her name?",anger
1235,She was worse.,anger
1236,"And I’ll go to Rome; there’s a wilderness, and there I shall be no trouble to anyone, only I’ll take Seryozha and the little one.... No, you can’t forgive me!",anger
1237,"I know, it can’t be forgiven!",anger
1238,"No, no, go away, you’re too good!” She held his hand in one burning hand, while she pushed him away with the other.",anger
1239,"The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing, and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it.",fear
1240,He suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known.,joy
1241,"He did not think that the Christian law that he had been all his life trying to follow, enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies; but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart.",joy
1242,"He knelt down, and laying his head in the curve of her arm, which burned him as with fire through the sleeve, he sobbed like a little child.",sadness
1243,"She put her arm around his head, moved towards him, and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes.",joy
1244,“That is he.,anger
1245,I knew him!,anger
1246,"Now, forgive me, everyone, forgive me!...",anger
1247,They’ve come again; why don’t they go away?...,anger
1248,"Oh, take these cloaks off me!” The doctor unloosed her hands, carefully laying her on the pillow, and covered her up to the shoulders.",anger
1249,"She lay back submissively, and looked before her with beaming eyes.",joy
1250,"“Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, and I want nothing more.... Why doesn’t _he_ come?” she said, turning to the door towards Vronsky.",anger
1251,"“Do come, do come!",anger
1252,"Give him your hand.” Vronsky came to the side of the bed, and seeing Anna, again hid his face in his hands.",anger
1253,“Uncover your face—look at him!,anger
1254,"He’s a saint,” she said.",anger
1255,“Oh!,anger
1256,"uncover your face, do uncover it!” she said angrily.",anger
1257,"“Alexey Alexandrovitch, do uncover his face!",anger
1258,"I want to see him.” Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky’s hands and drew them away from his face, which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it.",sadness
1259,“Give him your hand.,anger
1260,"Forgive him.” Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes.",anger
1261,"“Thank God, thank God!” she said, “now everything is ready.",joy
1262,Only to stretch my legs a little.,joy
1263,"There, that’s capital.",anger
1264,"How badly these flowers are done—not a bit like a violet,” she said, pointing to the hangings.",anger
1265,"“My God, my God!",anger
1266,when will it end?,anger
1267,Give me some morphine.,anger
1268,"Doctor, give me some morphine!",anger
1269,"Oh, my God, my God!” And she tossed about on the bed.",anger
1270,"The doctors said that it was puerperal fever, and that it was ninety-nine chances in a hundred it would end in death.",anger
1271,"The whole day long there was fever, delirium, and unconsciousness.",sadness
1272,"At midnight the patient lay without consciousness, and almost without pulse.",joy
1273,The end was expected every minute.,anger
1274,"Vronsky had gone home, but in the morning he came to inquire, and Alexey Alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall, said: “Better stay, she might ask for you,” and himself led him to his wife’s boudoir.",joy
1275,"Towards morning, there was a return again of excitement, rapid thought and talk, and again it ended in unconsciousness.",joy
1276,"On the third day it was the same thing, and the doctors said there was hope.",joy
1277,"That day Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting, and closing the door sat down opposite him.",anger
1278,"“Alexey Alexandrovitch,” said Vronsky, feeling that a statement of the position was coming, “I can’t speak, I can’t understand.",joy
1279,Spare me!,anger
1280,"However hard it is for you, believe me, it is more terrible for me.” He would have risen; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and said: “I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary.",anger
1281,"I must explain my feelings, the feelings that have guided me and will guide me, so that you may not be in error regarding me.",joy
1282,"You know I had resolved on a divorce, and had even begun to take proceedings.",anger
1283,"I won’t conceal from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I will confess that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her.",anger
1284,"When I got the telegram, I came here with the same feelings; I will say more, I longed for her death.",love
1285,"But....” He paused, pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him.",sadness
1286,“But I saw her and forgave her.,anger
1287,And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty.,anger
1288,I forgive completely.,anger
1289,"I would offer the other cheek, I would give my cloak if my coat be taken.",anger
1290,"I pray to God only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness!” Tears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them impressed Vronsky.",joy
1291,"“This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the laughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her, and I will never utter a word of reproach to you,” Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.",anger
1292,"“My duty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with her, and I will be.",anger
1293,"If she wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I suppose it would be better for you to go away.” He got up, and sobs cut short his words.",sadness
1294,"Vronsky too was getting up, and in a stooping, not yet erect posture, looked up at him from under his brows.",anger
1295,"He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch’s feeling, but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life.",sadness
1296,"After the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch, Vronsky went out onto the steps of the Karenins’ house and stood still, with difficulty remembering where he was, and where he ought to walk or drive.",anger
1297,"He felt disgraced, humiliated, guilty, and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation.",sadness
1298,He felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then.,anger
1299,"All the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm, had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable.",anger
1300,"The betrayed husband, who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature, an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness, had suddenly been summoned by her herself, elevated to an awe-inspiring pinnacle, and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself, not malignant, not false, not ludicrous, but kind and straightforward and large.",joy
1301,"Vronsky could not but feel this, and the parts were suddenly reversed.",sadness
1302,"Vronsky felt his elevation and his own abasement, his truth and his own falsehood.",joy
1303,"He felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow, while he had been base and petty in his deceit.",anger
1304,But this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery.,sadness
1305,"He felt unutterably wretched now, for his passion for Anna, which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler, now that he knew he had lost her forever, was stronger than ever it had been.",sadness
1306,"He had seen all of her in her illness, had come to know her very soul, and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then.",anger
1307,"And now when he had learned to know her, to love her as she should be loved, he had been humiliated before her, and had lost her forever, leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory.",sadness
1308,"Most terrible of all had been his ludicrous, shameful position when Alexey Alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face.",sadness
1309,"He stood on the steps of the Karenins’ house like one distraught, and did not know what to do.",fear
1310,"“A sledge, sir?” asked the porter.",anger
1311,"“Yes, a sledge.” On getting home, after three sleepless nights, Vronsky, without undressing, lay down flat on the sofa, clasping his hands and laying his head on them.",sadness
1312,His head was heavy.,anger
1313,"Images, memories, and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness.",joy
1314,"First it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon, then the midwife’s white hands, then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed.",anger
1315,“To sleep!,sadness
1316,"To forget!” he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy, he will go to sleep at once.",joy
1317,And the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness.,sadness
1318,"The waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head, when all at once—it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him.",anger
1319,"He started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa, and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees.",fear
1320,His eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep.,joy
1321,The heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone.,sadness
1322,"“You may trample me in the mud,” he heard Alexey Alexandrovitch’s words and saw him standing before him, and saw Anna’s face with its burning flush and glittering eyes, gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at Alexey Alexandrovitch; he saw his own, as he fancied, foolish and ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face.",sadness
1323,He stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes.,anger
1324,“To sleep!,sadness
1325,To forget!” he repeated to himself.,anger
1326,But with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever Anna’s face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races.,joy
1327,"“That is not and will not be, and she wants to wipe it out of her memory.",sadness
1328,But I cannot live without it.,anger
1329,How can we be reconciled?,anger
1330,"how can we be reconciled?” he said aloud, and unconsciously began to repeat these words.",anger
1331,"This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories, which he felt were thronging in his brain.",sadness
1332,But repeating words did not check his imagination for long.,joy
1333,"Again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind, and then his recent humiliation.",sadness
1334,"“Take away his hands,” Anna’s voice says.",joy
1335,He takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face.,sadness
1336,"He still lay down, trying to sleep, though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it, and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought, trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images.",joy
1337,"He listened, and heard in a strange, mad whisper words repeated: “I did not appreciate it, did not make enough of it.",anger
1338,"I did not appreciate it, did not make enough of it.” “What’s this?",joy
1339,Am I going out of my mind?” he said to himself.,anger
1340,“Perhaps.,anger
1341,"What makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?” he answered himself, and opening his eyes, he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him, worked by Varya, his brother’s wife.",anger
1342,"He touched the tassel of the cushion, and tried to think of Varya, of when he had seen her last.",anger
1343,But to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort.,anger
1344,"“No, I must sleep!” He moved the cushion up, and pressed his head into it, but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut.",anger
1345,He jumped up and sat down.,anger
1346,"“That’s all over for me,” he said to himself.",anger
1347,“I must think what to do.,anger
1348,What is left?” His mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of Anna.,anger
1349,“Ambition?,anger
1350,Serpuhovskoy?,anger
1351,Society?,anger
1352,The court?” He could not come to a pause anywhere.,joy
1353,"All of it had had meaning before, but now there was no reality in it.",anger
1354,"He got up from the sofa, took off his coat, undid his belt, and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely, walked up and down the room.",sadness
1355,"“This is how people go mad,” he repeated, “and how they shoot themselves ... to escape humiliation,” he added slowly.",anger
1356,"He went to the door and closed it, then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table, took a revolver, looked round him, turned it to a loaded barrel, and sank into thought.",anger
1357,"For two minutes, his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought, he stood with the revolver in his hand, motionless, thinking.",anger
1358,"“Of course,” he said to himself, as though a logical, continuous, and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion.",joy
1359,"In reality this “of course,” that seemed convincing to him, was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times already during the last hour—memories of happiness lost forever.",sadness
1360,"There was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life, the same consciousness of humiliation.",sadness
1361,Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same.,joy
1362,"“Of course,” he repeated, when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images, and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest, and clutching it vigorously with his whole hand, as it were, squeezing it in his fist, he pulled the trigger.",sadness
1363,"He did not hear the sound of the shot, but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling.",anger
1364,"He tried to clutch at the edge of the table, dropped the revolver, staggered, and sat down on the ground, looking about him in astonishment.",fear
1365,"He did not recognize his room, looking up from the ground, at the bent legs of the table, at the wastepaper basket, and the tiger-skin rug.",anger
1366,"The hurried, creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing-room brought him to his senses.",anger
1367,"He made an effort at thought, and was aware that he was on the floor; and seeing blood on the tiger-skin rug and on his arm, he knew he had shot himself.",anger
1368,“Idiotic!,anger
1369,"Missed!” he said, fumbling after the revolver.",anger
1370,The revolver was close beside him—he sought further off.,anger
1371,"Still feeling for it, he stretched out to the other side, and not being strong enough to keep his balance, fell over, streaming with blood.",joy
1372,"The elegant, whiskered manservant, who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves, was so panic-stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor, that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance.",sadness
1373,"An hour later Varya, his brother’s wife, had arrived, and with the assistance of three doctors, whom she had sent for in all directions, and who all appeared at the same moment, she got the wounded man to bed, and remained to nurse him.",anger
1374,"The mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that, when preparing for seeing his wife, he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere, and he might forgive her, and she might not die—this mistake was two months after his return from Moscow brought home to him in all its significance.",joy
1375,"But the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency, but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife, he had not known his own heart.",joy
1376,"At his sick wife’s bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others, and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness.",love
1377,"And pity for her, and remorse for having desired her death, and most of all, the joy of forgiveness, made him at once conscious, not simply of the relief of his own sufferings, but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before.",joy
1378,"He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy; that what had seemed insoluble while he was judging, blaming, and hating, had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved.",sadness
1379,He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse.,sadness
1380,"He forgave Vronsky, and pitied him, especially after reports reached him of his despairing action.",anger
1381,He felt more for his son than before.,joy
1382,And he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him.,anger
1383,"But for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of pity, only, but of tenderness.",sadness
1384,"At first, from a feeling of compassion alone, he had been interested in the delicate little creature, who was not his child, and who was cast on one side during her mother’s illness, and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her, and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her.",joy
1385,"He would go into the nursery several times a day, and sit there for a long while, so that the nurses, who were at first afraid of him, got quite used to his presence.",fear
1386,"Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the saffron-red, downy, wrinkled face of the sleeping baby, watching the movements of the frowning brows, and the fat little hands, with clenched fingers, that rubbed the little eyes and nose.",anger
1387,"At such moments particularly, Alexey Alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony, and saw nothing extraordinary in his position, nothing that ought to be changed.",joy
1388,"But as time went on, he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him, he would not long be allowed to remain in it.",joy
1389,"He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul, there was another, a brutal force, as powerful, or more powerful, which controlled his life, and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for.",joy
1390,"He felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder, that he was not understood, and that something was expected of him.",joy
1391,"Above all, he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife.",sadness
1392,"When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away, Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of him, ill at ease with him, and could not look him straight in the face.",anger
1393,"She seemed to be wanting, and not daring, to tell him something; and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue, she seemed to be expecting something from him.",anger
1394,"Towards the end of February it happened that Anna’s baby daughter, who had been named Anna too, fell ill. Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning, and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for, he went to his office.",anger
1395,"On finishing his work, he returned home at four.",anger
1396,"Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery and a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak.",joy
1397,“Who is here?” asked Alexey Alexandrovitch.,anger
1398,"“Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya,” the groom answered, and it seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned.",anger
1399,"During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that his worldly acquaintances, especially women, took a peculiar interest in him and his wife.",anger
1400,"All these acquaintances he observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something; the same mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer’s eyes, and just now in the eyes of this groom.",joy
1401,"Everyone seemed, somehow, hugely delighted, as though they had just been at a wedding.",joy
1402,"When they met him, with ill-disguised enjoyment they inquired after his wife’s health.",anger
1403,"The presence of Princess Tverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her, and also because he disliked her, and he went straight to the nursery.",anger
1404,"In the day nursery Seryozha, leaning on the table with his legs on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily.",anger
1405,"The English governess, who had during Anna’s illness replaced the French one, was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl.",anger
1406,"She hurriedly got up, curtseyed, and pulled Seryozha.",anger
1407,"Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son’s hair, answered the governess’s inquiries about his wife, and asked what the doctor had said of the baby.",anger
1408,"“The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, sir.” “But she is still in pain,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, listening to the baby’s screaming in the next room.",anger
1409,"“I think it’s the wet-nurse, sir,” the Englishwoman said firmly.",anger
1410,"“What makes you think so?” he asked, stopping short.",anger
1411,"“It’s just as it was at Countess Paul’s, sir.",anger
1412,"They gave the baby medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse had no milk, sir.” Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door.",anger
1413,"The baby was lying with its head thrown back, stiffening itself in the nurse’s arms, and would not take the plump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse, who was bending over her.",anger
1414,“Still no better?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.,joy
1415,"“She’s very restless,” answered the nurse in a whisper.",fear
1416,"“Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk,” he said.",anger
1417,"“I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.” “Then why didn’t you say so?” “Who’s one to say it to?",anger
1418,Anna Arkadyevna still ill....” said the nurse discontentedly.,anger
1419,The nurse was an old servant of the family.,anger
1420,And in her simple words there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position.,joy
1421,"The baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and sobbing.",sadness
1422,"The nurse, with a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the wet-nurse’s arms, and began walking up and down, rocking it.",sadness
1423,"“You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1424,"The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse, frightened at the idea of losing her place, muttered something to herself, and covering her bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk.",joy
1425,"In that smile, too, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position.",anger
1426,"“Luckless child!” said the nurse, hushing the baby, and still walking up and down with it.",anger
1427,"Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro.",sadness
1428,"When the child at last was still, and had been put in a deep bed, and the nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left her, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, and walking awkwardly on tiptoe, approached the baby.",fear
1429,"For a minute he was still, and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby; but all at once a smile, that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead, came out on his face, and he went as softly out of the room.",anger
1430,"In the dining-room he rang the bell, and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor.",anger
1431,"He felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her; he had no wish, either, to see Princess Betsy.",anger
1432,"But his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual; and so, overcoming his disinclination, he went towards the bedroom.",anger
1433,"As he walked over the soft rug towards the door, he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear.",anger
1434,"“If he hadn’t been going away, I could have understood your answer and his too.",anger
1435,"But your husband ought to be above that,” Betsy was saying.",anger
1436,“It’s not for my husband; for myself I don’t wish it.,anger
1437,Don’t say that!” answered Anna’s excited voice.,joy
1438,"“Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself on your account....” “That’s just why I don’t want to.” With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved.",sadness
1439,"But reflecting that this would be undignified, he turned back again, and clearing his throat, he went up to the bedroom.",anger
1440,"The voices were silent, and he went in.",anger
1441,"Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head, was sitting on a settee.",anger
1442,"The eagerness died out of her face, as it always did, at the sight of her husband; she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy.",anger
1443,"Betsy, dressed in the height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt, was sitting beside Anna, her tall flat figure held erect.",joy
1444,"Bowing her head, she greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile.",joy
1445,"“Ah!” she said, as though surprised.",surprise
1446,“I’m very glad you’re at home.,joy
1447,"You never put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven’t seen you ever since Anna has been ill.",anger
1448,I have heard all about it—your anxiety.,fear
1449,"Yes, you’re a wonderful husband!” she said, with a meaning and affable air, as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his wife.",anger
1450,"Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly, and kissing his wife’s hand, asked how she was.",anger
1451,"“Better, I think,” she said, avoiding his eyes.",anger
1452,"“But you’ve rather a feverish-looking color,” he said, laying stress on the word “feverish.” “We’ve been talking too much,” said Betsy.",anger
1453,"“I feel it’s selfishness on my part, and I am going away.” She got up, but Anna, suddenly flushing, quickly caught at her hand.",sadness
1454,"“No, wait a minute, please.",joy
1455,"I must tell you ... no, you.” she turned to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson.",joy
1456,"“I won’t and can’t keep anything secret from you,” she said.",joy
1457,Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head.,anger
1458,"“Betsy’s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say good-bye before his departure for Tashkend.” She did not look at her husband, and was evidently in haste to have everything out, however hard it might be for her.",sadness
1459,"“I told her I could not receive him.” “You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch,” Betsy corrected her.",anger
1460,"“Oh, no, I can’t receive him; and what object would there....” She stopped suddenly, and glanced inquiringly at her husband (he did not look at her).",anger
1461,"“In short, I don’t wish it....” Alexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand.",anger
1462,"Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers, but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand.",anger
1463,"“I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but....” he said, feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself, he could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya, who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world, and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness.",love
1464,"He stopped short, looking at Princess Tverskaya.",anger
1465,"“Well, good-bye, my darling,” said Betsy, getting up.",joy
1466,"She kissed Anna, and went out.",anger
1467,Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out.,anger
1468,“Alexey Alexandrovitch!,anger
1469,"I know you are a truly magnanimous man,” said Betsy, stopping in the little drawing-room, and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more.",joy
1470,"“I am an outsider, but I so love her and respect you that I venture to advise.",joy
1471,Receive him.,anger
1472,"Alexey Vronsky is the soul of honor, and he is going away to Tashkend.” “Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice.",joy
1473,"But the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself.” He said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be, there could be no dignity in his position.",joy
1474,"And he saw this by the suppressed, malicious, and ironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase.",anger
1475,"Alexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing-room, and went to his wife.",anger
1476,"She was lying down, but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude, and looked in a scared way at him.",fear
1477,He saw she had been crying.,anger
1478,"“I am very grateful for your confidence in me.” He repeated gently in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy’s presence in French, and sat down beside her.",sadness
1479,"When he spoke to her in Russian, using the Russian “thou” of intimacy and affection, it was insufferably irritating to Anna.",love
1480,“And I am very grateful for your decision.,joy
1481,"I, too, imagine that since he is going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here.",anger
1482,"However, if....” “But I’ve said so already, so why repeat it?” Anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing.",sadness
1483,"“No sort of necessity,” she thought, “for a man to come and say good-bye to the woman he loves, for whom he was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined himself, and who cannot live without him.",anger
1484,"No sort of necessity!” she compressed her lips, and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins.",anger
1485,They were rubbing each other.,anger
1486,"“Let us never speak of it,” she added more calmly.",joy
1487,"“I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad to see....” Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning.",joy
1488,"“That my wish coincides with your own,” she finished quickly, exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say.",anger
1489,"“Yes,” he assented; “and Princess Tverskaya’s interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for.",anger
1490,"She especially....” “I don’t believe a word of what’s said about her,” said Anna quickly.",anger
1491,“I know she really cares for me.” Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing.,sadness
1492,"She played nervously with the tassel of her dressing-gown, glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself, though she could not control it.",sadness
1493,Her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence.,anger
1494,"“I have just sent for the doctor,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1495,"“I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?” “No, the little one cries, and they say the nurse hasn’t enough milk.” “Why didn’t you let me nurse her, when I begged to?",anger
1496,"Anyway” (Alexey Alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that “anyway”), “she’s a baby, and they’re killing her.” She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her.",anger
1497,"“I begged to nurse her, I wasn’t allowed to, and now I’m blamed for it.” “I don’t blame....” “Yes, you do blame me!",anger
1498,My God!,anger
1499,why didn’t I die!” And she broke into sobs.,anger
1500,"“Forgive me, I’m nervous, I’m unjust,” she said, controlling herself, “but do go away....” “No, it can’t go on like this,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he left his wife’s room.",anger
1501,"Never had the impossibility of his position in the world’s eyes, and his wife’s hatred of him, and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations, and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to his wife, been presented to him with such distinctness as that day.",joy
1502,"He saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something, but what exactly, he could not make out.",anger
1503,He felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement.,anger
1504,"He believed that for Anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they all thought this out of the question, he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed, so long as the children were not disgraced, and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position.",sadness
1505,"Bad as this might be, it was anyway better than a rupture, which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position, and deprive him of everything he cared for.",sadness
1506,"But he felt helpless; he knew beforehand that everyone was against him, and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right, but would be forced to do what was wrong, though it seemed the proper thing to them.",fear
1507,"Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing-room, she was met in the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just come from Yeliseev’s, where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received.",joy
1508,“Ah!,anger
1509,princess!,joy
1510,what a delightful meeting!” he began.,joy
1511,"“I’ve been to see you.” “A meeting for one minute, for I’m going,” said Betsy, smiling and putting on her glove.",joy
1512,"“Don’t put on your glove yet, princess; let me kiss your hand.",anger
1513,There’s nothing I’m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand.” He kissed Betsy’s hand.,anger
1514,"“When shall we see each other?” “You don’t deserve it,” answered Betsy, smiling.",joy
1515,"“Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I’ve become a most serious person.",anger
1516,"I don’t only manage my own affairs, but other people’s too,” he said, with a significant expression.",joy
1517,"“Oh, I’m so glad!” answered Betsy, at once understanding that he was speaking of Anna.",joy
1518,"And going back into the drawing-room, they stood in a corner.",anger
1519,"“He’s killing her,” said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning.",anger
1520,"“It’s impossible, impossible....” “I’m so glad you think so,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression, “that’s what I’ve come to Petersburg for.” “The whole town’s talking of it,” she said.",anger
1521,“It’s an impossible position.,anger
1522,She pines and pines away.,sadness
1523,He doesn’t understand that she’s one of those women who can’t trifle with their feelings.,sadness
1524,"One of two things: either let him take her away, act with energy, or give her a divorce.",anger
1525,"This is stifling her.” “Yes, yes ... just so....” Oblonsky said, sighing.",anger
1526,“That’s what I’ve come for.,anger
1527,"At least not solely for that ... I’ve been made a _Kammerherr_; of course, one has to say thank you.",anger
1528,"But the chief thing was having to settle this.” “Well, God help you!” said Betsy.",anger
1529,"After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing her hand above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister.",anger
1530,He found her in tears.,sadness
1531,"Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits, Stepan Arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic, poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood.",sadness
1532,"He asked her how she was, and how she had spent the morning.",anger
1533,"“Very, very miserably.",joy
1534,"Today and this morning and all past days and days to come,” she said.",joy
1535,“I think you’re giving way to pessimism.,sadness
1536,"You must rouse yourself, you must look life in the face.",anger
1537,"I know it’s hard, but....” “I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices,” Anna began suddenly, “but I hate him for his virtues.",anger
1538,I can’t live with him.,anger
1539,Do you understand?,anger
1540,"the sight of him has a physical effect on me, it makes me beside myself.",anger
1541,"I can’t, I can’t live with him.",anger
1542,What am I to do?,anger
1543,"I have been unhappy, and used to think one couldn’t be more unhappy, but the awful state of things I am going through now, I could never have conceived.",anger
1544,"Would you believe it, that knowing he’s a good man, a splendid man, that I’m not worth his little finger, still I hate him.",joy
1545,I hate him for his generosity.,anger
1546,"And there’s nothing left for me but....” She would have said death, but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her finish.",anger
1547,"“You are ill and overwrought,” he said; “believe me, you’re exaggerating dreadfully.",anger
1548,There’s nothing so terrible in it.” And Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.,anger
1549,"No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s place, having to do with such despair, would have ventured to smile (the smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound, but softened and soothed.",joy
1550,"His gentle, soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil.",love
1551,And Anna soon felt this.,joy
1552,"“No, Stiva,” she said, “I’m lost, lost!",sadness
1553,worse than lost!,sadness
1554,"I can’t say yet that all is over; on the contrary, I feel that it’s not over.",joy
1555,I’m an overstrained string that must snap.,anger
1556,"But it’s not ended yet ... and it will have a fearful end.” “No matter, we must let the string be loosened, little by little.",fear
1557,"There’s no position from which there is no way of escape.” “I have thought, and thought.",joy
1558,"Only one....” Again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death, and he would not let her say it.",anger
1559,"“Not at all,” he said.",anger
1560,“Listen to me.,anger
1561,You can’t see your own position as I can.,joy
1562,Let me tell you candidly my opinion.” Again he smiled discreetly his almond-oil smile.,joy
1563,“I’ll begin from the beginning.,anger
1564,You married a man twenty years older than yourself.,joy
1565,You married him without love and not knowing what love was.,joy
1566,"It was a mistake, let’s admit.” “A fearful mistake!” said Anna.",fear
1567,"“But I repeat, it’s an accomplished fact.",joy
1568,"Then you had, let us say, the misfortune to love a man not your husband.",anger
1569,"That was a misfortune; but that, too, is an accomplished fact.",joy
1570,"And your husband knew it and forgave it.” He stopped at each sentence, waiting for her to object, but she made no answer.",anger
1571,“That’s so.,anger
1572,Now the question is: can you go on living with your husband?,anger
1573,Do you wish it?,anger
1574,"Does he wish it?” “I know nothing, nothing.” “But you said yourself that you can’t endure him.” “No, I didn’t say so.",sadness
1575,I deny it.,anger
1576,"I can’t tell, I don’t know anything about it.” “Yes, but let....” “You can’t understand.",anger
1577,"I feel I’m lying head downwards in a sort of pit, but I ought not to save myself.",sadness
1578,"And I can’t....” “Never mind, we’ll slip something under and pull you out.",anger
1579,"I understand you: I understand that you can’t take it on yourself to express your wishes, your feelings.” “There’s nothing, nothing I wish ... except for it to be all over.” “But he sees this and knows it.",joy
1580,And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?,anger
1581,"You’re wretched, he’s wretched, and what good can come of it?",anger
1582,"while divorce would solve the difficulty completely.” With some effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his central idea, and looked significantly at her.",anger
1583,"She said nothing, and shook her cropped head in dissent.",anger
1584,"But from the look in her face, that suddenly brightened into its old beauty, he saw that if she did not desire this, it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness.",sadness
1585,“I’m awfully sorry for you!,sadness
1586,"And how happy I should be if I could arrange things!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling more boldly.",joy
1587,"“Don’t speak, don’t say a word!",anger
1588,God grant only that I may speak as I feel.,joy
1589,"I’m going to him.” Anna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes, and said nothing.",joy
1590,"Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board, walked into Alexey Alexandrovitch’s room.",anger
1591,"Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about his room with his hands behind his back, thinking of just what Stepan Arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife.",sadness
1592,"“I’m not interrupting you?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, on the sight of his brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him.",sadness
1593,"To conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way, and sniffing the leather, took a cigarette out of it.",anger
1594,“No.,anger
1595,Do you want anything?” Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without eagerness.,anger
1596,"“Yes, I wished ...",anger
1597,"I wanted ... yes, I wanted to talk to you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity.",joy
1598,This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong.,surprise
1599,Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him.,anger
1600,"“I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you,” he said, reddening.",joy
1601,"Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing, but his face struck Stepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice.",anger
1602,“I intended ...,joy
1603,"I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position,” he said, still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint.",sadness
1604,"Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully, looked at his brother-in-law, and without answering went up to the table, took from it an unfinished letter, and handed it to his brother-in-law.",anger
1605,“I think unceasingly of the same thing.,joy
1606,"And here is what I had begun writing, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that my presence irritates her,” he said, as he gave him the letter.",anger
1607,"Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter, looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him, and began to read.",anger
1608,“I see that my presence is irksome to you.,joy
1609,"Painful as it is to me to believe it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise.",sadness
1610,"I don’t blame you, and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life.",joy
1611,"I do not regret, and shall never regret, what I have done; but I have desired one thing—your good, the good of your soul—and now I see I have not attained that.",joy
1612,Tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul.,joy
1613,"I put myself entirely in your hands, and trust to your feeling of what’s right.” Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter, and with the same surprise continued looking at his brother-in-law, not knowing what to say.",joy
1614,"This silence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch’s lips began twitching nervously, while he still gazed without speaking at Karenin’s face.",fear
1615,"“That’s what I wanted to say to her,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning away.",anger
1616,"“Yes, yes....” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, not able to answer for the tears that were choking him.",anger
1617,"“Yes, yes, I understand you,” he brought out at last.",anger
1618,"“I want to know what she would like,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1619,“I am afraid she does not understand her own position.,fear
1620,"She is not a judge,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, recovering himself.",anger
1621,"“She is crushed, simply crushed by your generosity.",sadness
1622,"If she were to read this letter, she would be incapable of saying anything, she would only hang her head lower than ever.” “Yes, but what’s to be done in that case?",anger
1623,"how explain, how find out her wishes?” “If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position.” “So you consider it must be ended?” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted him.",sadness
1624,"“But how?” he added, with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him.",joy
1625,"“I see no possible way out of it.” “There is some way of getting out of every position,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, standing up and becoming more cheerful.",joy
1626,“There was a time when you thought of breaking off....,anger
1627,If you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy....” “Happiness may be variously understood.,joy
1628,"But suppose that I agree to everything, that I want nothing: what way is there of getting out of our position?” “If you care to know my opinion,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening, almond-oil tenderness with which he had been talking to Anna.",sadness
1629,"His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey Alexandrovitch, feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it, was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.",joy
1630,“She will never speak out about it.,anger
1631,"But one thing is possible, one thing she might desire,” he went on, “that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them.",sadness
1632,"To my thinking, in your position what’s essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another.",joy
1633,"And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides.” “Divorce,” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted, in a tone of aversion.",sadness
1634,"“Yes, I imagine that divorce—yes, divorce,” Stepan Arkadyevitch repeated, reddening.",sadness
1635,“That is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in.,anger
1636,What can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together?,anger
1637,That may always happen.” Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes.,sadness
1638,“There’s only one point to be considered: is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties?,joy
1639,"If not, it is very simple,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, feeling more and more free from constraint.",joy
1640,"Alexey Alexandrovitch, scowling with emotion, muttered something to himself, and made no answer.",anger
1641,"All that seemed so simple to Stepan Arkadyevitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times.",anger
1642,"And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him utterly impossible.",sadness
1643,"Divorce, the details of which he knew by this time, seemed to him now out of the question, because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery, and still more suffering his wife, pardoned and beloved by him, to be caught in the fact and put to public shame.",sadness
1644,Divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds.,anger
1645,What would become of his son in case of a divorce?,anger
1646,To leave him with his mother was out of the question.,anger
1647,"The divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family, in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good.",joy
1648,Keep him with him?,anger
1649,"He knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part, and that he did not want.",anger
1650,"But apart from this, what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey Alexandrovitch was, that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining Anna.",anger
1651,"The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow, that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself, and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably, had sunk into his heart.",anger
1652,"And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her, with his devotion to the children, he understood it now in his own way.",joy
1653,"To consent to a divorce, to give her her freedom, meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life—the children whom he loved; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the path of right, to thrust her down to her ruin.",anger
1654,"If she were divorced, he knew she would join her life to Vronsky’s, and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her husband was living.",anger
1655,"“She will join him, and in a year or two he will throw her over, or she will form a new tie,” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
1656,"“And I, by agreeing to an unlawful divorce, shall be to blame for her ruin.” He had thought it all over hundreds of times, and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple, as Stepan Arkadyevitch had said, but was utterly impossible.",sadness
1657,"He did not believe a single word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him; to every word he had a thousand objections to make, but he listened to him, feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit.",joy
1658,“The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce.,anger
1659,"She does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything, she leaves it all to your generosity.” “My God, my God!",joy
1660,"what for?” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done the same, he hid his face for shame in his hands.",sadness
1661,"“You are distressed, I understand that.",fear
1662,"But if you think it over....” “Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also,” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1663,"“Yes, yes!” he cried in a shrill voice.",anger
1664,"“I will take the disgrace on myself, I will give up even my son, but ... but wouldn’t it be better to let it alone?",sadness
1665,"Still you may do as you like....”  And turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him, he sat down on a chair at the window.",anger
1666,"There was bitterness, there was shame in his heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness.",joy
1667,Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched.,anger
1668,He was silent for a space.,fear
1669,"“Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she appreciates your generosity,” he said.",joy
1670,"“But it seems it was the will of God,” he added, and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness.",sadness
1671,"Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply, but tears stopped him.",anger
1672,"“This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such.",anger
1673,"I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both her and you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
1674,"When he went out of his brother-in-law’s room he was touched, but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion, for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would not go back on his words.",joy
1675,"To this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement, that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends.",joy
1676,He put this riddle into two or three different ways.,anger
1677,"“But I’ll work it out better than that,” he said to himself with a smile.",joy
1678,"Vronsky’s wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch the heart, and for several days he had lain between life and death.",anger
1679,"The first time he was able to speak, Varya, his brother’s wife, was alone in the room.",anger
1680,"“Varya,” he said, looking sternly at her, “I shot myself by accident.",anger
1681,"And please never speak of it, and tell everyone so.",joy

1683,"His eyes were clear, not feverish; but their expression was stern.",anger
1684,“Thank God!” she said.,anger
1685,“You’re not in pain?”  “A little here.” He pointed to his breast.,joy
1686,"“Then let me change your bandages.”  In silence, stiffening his broad jaws, he looked at her while she bandaged him up.",anger
1687,When she had finished he said:  “I’m not delirious.,anger
1688,Please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose.”  “No one does say so.,joy
1689,"Only I hope you won’t shoot yourself by accident any more,” she said, with a questioning smile.",joy
1690,"“Of course I won’t, but it would have been better....”  And he smiled gloomily.",joy
1691,"In spite of these words and this smile, which so frightened Varya, when the inflammation was over and he began to recover, he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery.",fear
1692,"By his action he had, as it were, washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before.",sadness
1693,He could now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch.,anger
1694,"He recognized all his magnanimity, but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it.",sadness

1696,"He saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame, and he could live in accordance with his own habits.",sadness
1697,"One thing he could not pluck out of his heart, though he never ceased struggling with it, was the regret, amounting to despair, that he had lost her forever.",sadness
1698,"That now, having expiated his sin against the husband, he was bound to renounce her, and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband, he had firmly decided in his heart; but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love, he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at the time, and that haunted him in all their charm.",joy
1699,"Serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation.",anger
1700,"But the nearer the time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty.",anger
1701,"His wound had healed, and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for Tashkend.",anger
1702,"“To see her once and then to bury myself, to die,” he thought, and as he was paying farewell visits, he uttered this thought to Betsy.",anger
1703,"Charged with this commission, Betsy had gone to Anna, and brought him back a negative reply.",anger
1704,"“So much the better,” thought Vronsky, when he received the news.",joy
1705,"“It was a weakness, which would have shattered what strength I have left.”  Next day Betsy herself came to him in the morning, and announced that she had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey Alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce, and that therefore Vronsky could see Anna.",sadness
1706,"Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat, forgetting all his resolutions, without asking when he could see her, where her husband was, Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins’.",anger
1707,"He ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid step, almost breaking into a run, he went into her room.",anger
1708,"And without considering, without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not, he flung his arms round her, and began to cover her face, her hands, her neck with kisses.",anger
1709,"Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought what she would say to him, but she did not succeed in saying anything of it; his passion mastered her.",anger
1710,"She tried to calm him, to calm herself, but it was too late.",anger
1711,His feeling infected her.,joy
1712,Her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing.,joy
1713,"“Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,” she said at last, pressing his hands to her bosom.",joy
1714,"“So it had to be,” he said.",anger
1715,"“So long as we live, it must be so.",anger
1716,"I know it now.”  “That’s true,” she said, getting whiter and whiter, and embracing his head.",anger
1717,"“Still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened.”  “It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy.",joy
1718,"Our love, if it could be stronger, will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it,” he said, lifting his head and parting his strong teeth in a smile.",joy
1719,"And she could not but respond with a smile—not to his words, but to the love in his eyes.",anger
1720,She took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it.,anger
1721,“I don’t know you with this short hair.,joy
1722,You’ve grown so pretty.,joy
1723,A boy.,anger
1724,"But how pale you are!”  “Yes, I’m very weak,” she said, smiling.",fear
1725,And her lips began trembling again.,anger
1726,"“We’ll go to Italy; you will get strong,” he said.",joy
1727,"“Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?” she said, looking close into his eyes.",joy
1728,"“It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise.”  “Stiva says that _he_ has agreed to everything, but I can’t accept _his_ generosity,” she said, looking dreamily past Vronsky’s face.",fear
1729,“I don’t want a divorce; it’s all the same to me now.,anger

1731,What did it all matter?,anger
1732,"“Don’t speak of that, don’t think of it,” he said, turning her hand in his, and trying to draw her attention to him; but still she did not look at him.",anger
1733,"“Oh, why didn’t I die!",anger
1734,"it would have been better,” she said, and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks; but she tried to smile, so as not to wound him.",anger
1735,"To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would have been, Vronsky had till then considered, disgraceful and impossible.",anger
1736,"But now, without an instant’s consideration, he declined it, and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step, he immediately retired from the army.",anger
1737,"A month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his house at Petersburg, while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad, not having obtained a divorce, but having absolutely declined all idea of one.",anger
