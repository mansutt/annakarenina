0,﻿ Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.,sadness
1,Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.,anger
2,"The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him.",anger
3,"This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it.",joy
4,"Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys.",sadness
5,"The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days.",anger
6,"The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.",anger
7,"Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky—Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world—woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight o’clock in the morning, not in his wife’s bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study.",anger
8,"He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.",joy
9,"“Yes, yes, how was it now?” he thought, going over his dream.",anger
10,"“Now, how was it?",anger
11,To be sure!,joy
12,"Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American.",joy
13,"Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America.",anger
14,"Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang, _Il mio tesoro_—not _Il mio tesoro_ though, but something better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they were women, too,” he remembered.",sadness
15,"Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile.",joy
16,"“Yes, it was nice, very nice.",joy
17,"There was a great deal more that was delightful, only there’s no putting it into words, or even expressing it in one’s thoughts awake.” And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco.",joy
18,"And, as he had done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom.",sadness
19,"And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife’s room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he knitted his brows.",joy
20,"“Ah, ah, ah!",joy
21,"Oo!...” he muttered, recalling everything that had happened.",anger
22,"And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his own fault.",sadness
23,"“Yes, she won’t forgive me, and she can’t forgive me.",anger
24,"And the most awful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault, though I’m not to blame.",anger
25,"That’s the point of the whole situation,” he reflected.",anger
26,"“Oh, oh, oh!” he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.",sadness
27,"Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.",anger
28,"She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and indignation.",sadness
29,“What’s this?,joy
30,"this?” she asked, pointing to the letter.",anger
31,"And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wife’s words.",anger
32,There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful.,fear
33,He did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault.,anger
34,"Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even—anything would have been better than what he did do—his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)—utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.",joy
35,This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself.,anger
36,"Catching sight of that smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room.",anger
37,Since then she had refused to see her husband.,anger
38,"“It’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all,” thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
39,“But what’s to be done?,anger
40,"What’s to be done?” he said to himself in despair, and found no answer.",anger
41,Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself.,anger
42,He was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his conduct.,anger
43,"He could not at this date repent of the fact that he, a handsome, susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love with his wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and only a year younger than himself.",joy
44,All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife.,anger
45,"But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children, and himself.",sadness
46,Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her.,anger
47,"He had never clearly thought out the subject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact.",anger
48,"He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view.",joy
49,It had turned out quite the other way.,anger
50,"“Oh, it’s awful!",sadness
51,"oh dear, oh dear!",joy
52,"awful!” Stepan Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be done.",anger
53,“And how well things were going up till now!,joy
54,how well we got on!,anger
55,She was contented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in anything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she liked.,joy
56,It’s true it’s bad _her_ having been a governess in our house.,anger
57,That’s bad!,sadness
58,"There’s something common, vulgar, in flirting with one’s governess.",anger
59,But what a governess!” (He vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle.,joy
60,Roland and her smile.),joy
61,"“But after all, while she was in the house, I kept myself in hand.",anger
62,And the worst of it all is that she’s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so!,anger
63,"Oh, oh!",joy
64,"But what, what is to be done?” There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble.",joy
65,"That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day—that is, forget oneself.",anger
66,"To forget himself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life.",sadness
67,"“Then we shall see,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad, bare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step, turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily.",joy
68,He pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly.,anger
69,"It was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes, his boots, and a telegram.",anger
70,Matvey was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving.,anger
71,"“Are there any papers from the office?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.",anger
72,"“On the table,” replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile, “They’ve sent from the carriage-jobbers.” Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the looking-glass.",anger
73,"In the glance, in which their eyes met in the looking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another.",anger
74,Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes asked: “Why do you tell me that?,anger
75,"don’t you know?” Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and gazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.",joy
76,"“I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing,” he said.",anger
77,He had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand.,anger
78,Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself.,anger
79,"Tearing open the telegram, he read it through, guessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his face brightened.",anger
80,"“Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,” he said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a pink path through his long, curly whiskers.",anger
81,"“Thank God!” said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like his master, realized the significance of this arrival—that is, that Anna Arkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife.",anger
82,"“Alone, or with her husband?” inquired Matvey.",anger
83,"Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his upper lip, and he raised one finger.",anger
84,Matvey nodded at the looking-glass.,anger
85,“Alone.,anger
86,"Is the room to be got ready upstairs?” “Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.” “Darya Alexandrovna?” Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.",joy
87,"“Yes, inform her.",anger
88,"Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do what she tells you.” “You want to try it on,” Matvey understood, but he only said, “Yes, sir.” Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came back into the room with the telegram in his hand.",anger
89,The barber had gone.,anger
90,“Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away.,anger
91,"Let him do—that is you—as he likes,” he said, laughing only with his eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his head on one side.",anger
92,Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute.,fear
93,Then a good-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face.,joy
94,"“Eh, Matvey?” he said, shaking his head.",anger
95,"“It’s all right, sir; she will come round,” said Matvey.",anger
96,"“Come round?” “Yes, sir.” “Do you think so?",anger
97,"Who’s there?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing the rustle of a woman’s dress at the door.",anger
98,"“It’s I,” said a firm, pleasant, woman’s voice, and the stern, pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at the doorway.",joy
99,"“Well, what is it, Matrona?” queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to her at the door.",anger
100,"Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife, and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house (even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna’s chief ally) was on his side.",anger
101,"“Well, what now?” he asked disconsolately.",anger
102,"“Go to her, sir; own your fault again.",anger
103,Maybe God will aid you.,anger
104,"She is suffering so, it’s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house is topsy-turvy.",sadness
105,"You must have pity, sir, on the children.",anger
106,"Beg her forgiveness, sir.",anger
107,There’s no help for it!,anger
108,One must take the consequences....” “But she won’t see me.” “You do your part.,anger
109,"God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.” “Come, that’ll do, you can go,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, blushing suddenly.",anger
110,"“Well now, do dress me.” He turned to Matvey and threw off his dressing-gown decisively.",anger
111,"Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse’s collar, and, blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the well-groomed body of his master.",joy
112,"When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his cigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and seals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean, fragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting for him, and beside the coffee, letters and papers from the office.",joy
113,He read the letters.,anger
114,"One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was buying a forest on his wife’s property.",anger
115,"To sell this forest was absolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his wife, the subject could not be discussed.",anger
116,The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife.,anger
117,"And the idea that he might be led on by his interests, that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest—that idea hurt him.",sadness
118,"When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the office-papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of business, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the papers, turned to his coffee.",anger
119,"As he sipped his coffee, he opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it.",anger
120,"Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme one, but one advocating the views held by the majority.",anger
121,"And in spite of the fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for him, he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper, and he only changed them when the majority changed them—or, more strictly speaking, he did not change them, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him.",anger
122,"Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views; these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took those that were being worn.",sadness
123,"And for him, living in a certain society—owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental activity—to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat.",joy
124,"If there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many of his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life.",joy
125,"The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money.",anger
126,"The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him into lying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his nature.",anger
127,"The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world.",joy
128,"And with all this, Stepan Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop at Rurik and disown the first founder of his family—the monkey.",anger
129,"And so Liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s, and he liked his newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it diffused in his brain.",sadness
130,"He read the leading article, in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, “in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress,” etc., etc.",joy
131,"He read another article, too, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry.",anger
132,"With his characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always did, a certain satisfaction.",joy
133,But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona Philimonovna’s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household.,anger
134,"He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification.",joy
135,"Having finished the paper, a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled joyously: not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind—the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.",joy
136,"But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew thoughtful.",joy
137,"Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of Grisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard outside the door.",anger
138,"They were carrying something, and dropped it.",anger
139,"“I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,” said the little girl in English; “there, pick them up!” “Everything’s in confusion,” thought Stepan Arkadyevitch; “there are the children running about by themselves.” And going to the door, he called them.",anger
140,"They threw down the box, that represented a train, and came in to their father.",anger
141,"The little girl, her father’s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him, and hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers.",joy
142,"At last the little girl kissed his face, which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her hands, and was about to run away again; but her father held her back.",sadness
143,"“How is mamma?” he asked, passing his hand over his daughter’s smooth, soft little neck.",joy
144,"“Good morning,” he said, smiling to the boy, who had come up to greet him.",anger
145,"He was conscious that he loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his father’s chilly smile.",joy
146,“Mamma?,anger
147,"She is up,” answered the girl.",anger
148,Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed.,anger
149,"“That means that she’s not slept again all night,” he thought.",anger
150,"“Well, is she cheerful?” The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother, and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that her father must be aware of this, and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly.",joy
151,And she blushed for her father.,anger
152,"He at once perceived it, and blushed too.",anger
153,"“I don’t know,” she said.",anger
154,"“She did not say we must do our lessons, but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma’s.” “Well, go, Tanya, my darling.",anger
155,"Oh, wait a minute, though,” he said, still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.",anger
156,"He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a little box of sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, a chocolate and a fondant.",joy
157,"“For Grisha?” said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.",anger
158,"“Yes, yes.” And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed her on the roots of her hair and neck, and let her go.",anger
159,"“The carriage is ready,” said Matvey; “but there’s someone to see you with a petition.” “Been here long?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
160,"“Half an hour.” “How many times have I told you to tell me at once?” “One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,” said Matvey, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry.",anger
161,"“Well, show the person up at once,” said Oblonsky, frowning with vexation.",anger
162,"The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a request impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he generally did, made her sit down, heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her, and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply, and even wrote her, in his large, sprawling, good and legible hand, a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to her.",joy
163,"Having got rid of the staff captain’s widow, Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything.",anger
164,It appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget—his wife.,anger
165,"“Ah, yes!” He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a harassed expression.",joy
166,"“To go, or not to go!” he said to himself; and an inner voice told him he must not go, that nothing could come of it but falsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was impossible, because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love, or to make him an old man, not susceptible to love.",joy
167,Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature.,anger
168,"“It must be some time, though: it can’t go on like this,” he said, trying to give himself courage.",anger
169,"He squared his chest, took out a cigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a mother-of-pearl ashtray, and with rapid steps walked through the drawing-room, and opened the other door into his wife’s bedroom.",anger
170,"Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now scanty, once luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck, with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which looked prominent from the thinness of her face, was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room, before an open bureau, from which she was taking something.",joy
171,"Hearing her husband’s steps, she stopped, looking towards the door, and trying assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression.",anger
172,"She felt she was afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview.",fear
173,"She was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days—to sort out the children’s things and her own, so as to take them to her mother’s—and again she could not bring herself to do this; but now again, as each time before, she kept saying to herself, “that things cannot go on like this, that she must take some step” to punish him, put him to shame, avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her.",sadness
174,"She still continued to tell herself that she should leave him, but she was conscious that this was impossible; it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and loving him.",sadness
175,"Besides this, she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly, they would be still worse off where she was going with them all.",anger
176,"As it was, even in the course of these three days, the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup, and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before.",anger
177,"She was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but, cheating herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going.",sadness
178,"Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her.",anger
179,"But her face, to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.",sadness
180,“Dolly!” he said in a subdued and timid voice.,fear
181,"He bent his head towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health.",joy
182,In a rapid glance she scanned his figure that beamed with health and freshness.,joy
183,"“Yes, he is happy and content!” she thought; “while I.... And that disgusting good nature, which everyone likes him for and praises—I hate that good nature of his,” she thought.",joy
184,"Her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek contracted on the right side of her pale, nervous face.",fear
185,"“What do you want?” she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.",sadness
186,"“Dolly!” he repeated, with a quiver in his voice.",fear
187,"“Anna is coming today.” “Well, what is that to me?",anger
188,I can’t see her!” she cried.,anger
189,"“But you must, really, Dolly....” “Go away, go away, go away!” she shrieked, not looking at him, as though this shriek were called up by physical pain.",anger
190,"Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could hope that she would _come round_, as Matvey expressed it, and could quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he saw her tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of her voice, submissive to fate and full of despair, there was a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat, and his eyes began to shine with tears.",sadness
191,“My God!,anger
192,what have I done?,anger
193,Dolly!,anger
194,For God’s sake!...,anger
195,You know....” He could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.,anger
196,"She shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.",anger
197,"“Dolly, what can I say?...",anger
198,One thing: forgive....,anger
199,"Remember, cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant....” She dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it were beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently.",joy
200,"“—instant of passion?” he said, and would have gone on, but at that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and again the muscles of her right cheek worked.",sadness
201,"“Go away, go out of the room!” she shrieked still more shrilly, “and don’t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness.” She tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to support herself.",anger
202,"His face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were swimming with tears.",sadness
203,"“Dolly!” he said, sobbing now; “for mercy’s sake, think of the children; they are not to blame!",sadness
204,"I am to blame, and punish me, make me expiate my fault.",anger
205,"Anything I can do, I am ready to do anything!",joy
206,"I am to blame, no words can express how much I am to blame!",sadness
207,"But, Dolly, forgive me!” She sat down.",anger
208,"He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was unutterably sorry for her.",anger
209,"She tried several times to begin to speak, but could not.",anger
210,He waited.,anger
211,"“You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I remember them, and know that this means their ruin,” she said—obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last few days.",sadness
212,"She had called him “Stiva,” and he glanced at her with gratitude, and moved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with aversion.",sadness
213,"“I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything in the world to save them, but I don’t myself know how to save them.",anger
214,"By taking them away from their father, or by leaving them with a vicious father—yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ... has happened, can we live together?",anger
215,Is that possible?,joy
216,"Tell me, eh, is it possible?” she repeated, raising her voice, “after my husband, the father of my children, enters into a love affair with his own children’s governess?” “But what could I do?",joy
217,"what could I do?” he kept saying in a pitiful voice, not knowing what he was saying, as his head sank lower and lower.",sadness
218,"“You are loathsome to me, repulsive!” she shrieked, getting more and more heated.",anger
219,“Your tears mean nothing!,sadness
220,You have never loved me; you have neither heart nor honorable feeling!,sadness
221,"You are hateful to me, disgusting, a stranger—yes, a complete stranger!” With pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself—_stranger_.",anger
222,"He looked at her, and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him.",fear
223,He did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her.,anger
224,"She saw in him sympathy for her, but not love.",sadness
225,"“No, she hates me.",anger
226,"She will not forgive me,” he thought.",anger
227,“It is awful!,sadness
228,awful!” he said.,sadness
229,At that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had fallen down.,sadness
230,"Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly softened.",fear
231,"She seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though she did not know where she was, and what she was doing, and getting up rapidly, she moved towards the door.",anger
232,"“Well, she loves my child,” he thought, noticing the change of her face at the child’s cry, “my child: how can she hate me?” “Dolly, one word more,” he said, following her.",anger
233,"“If you come near me, I will call in the servants, the children!",anger
234,They may all know you are a scoundrel!,anger
235,"I am going away at once, and you may live here with your mistress!” And she went out, slamming the door.",anger
236,"Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued tread walked out of the room.",anger
237,“Matvey says she will come round; but how?,anger
238,I don’t see the least chance of it.,anger
239,"Ah, oh, how horrible it is!",anger
240,"And how vulgarly she shouted,” he said to himself, remembering her shriek and the words—“scoundrel” and “mistress.” “And very likely the maids were listening!",anger
241,Horribly vulgar!,anger
242,"horrible!” Stepan Arkadyevitch stood a few seconds alone, wiped his face, squared his chest, and walked out of the room.",anger
243,"It was Friday, and in the dining-room the German watchmaker was winding up the clock.",anger
244,"Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this punctual, bald watchmaker, “that the German was wound up for a whole lifetime himself, to wind up watches,” and he smiled.",joy
245,Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke: “And maybe she will come round!,love
246,"That’s a good expression, ‘_come round,_’” he thought.",joy
247,“I must repeat that.” “Matvey!” he shouted.,anger
248,"“Arrange everything with Darya in the sitting room for Anna Arkadyevna,” he said to Matvey when he came in.",anger
249,"“Yes, sir.” Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps.",anger
250,"“You won’t dine at home?” said Matvey, seeing him off.",anger
251,“That’s as it happens.,joy
252,"But here’s for the housekeeping,” he said, taking ten roubles from his pocketbook.",anger
253,"“That’ll be enough.” “Enough or not enough, we must make it do,” said Matvey, slamming the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps.",joy
254,"Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off, went back again to her bedroom.",anger
255,It was her solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it.,anger
256,"Even now, in the short time she had been in the nursery, the English governess and Matrona Philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her, which did not admit of delay, and which only she could answer: “What were the children to put on for their walk?",sadness
257,Should they have any milk?,anger
258,"Should not a new cook be sent for?” “Ah, let me alone, let me alone!” she said, and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to her husband, clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that slipped down on her bony fingers, and fell to going over in her memory all the conversation.",sadness
259,“He has gone!,anger
260,But has he broken it off with her?” she thought.,anger
261,“Can it be he sees her?,anger
262,Why didn’t I ask him!,anger
263,"No, no, reconciliation is impossible.",anger
264,"Even if we remain in the same house, we are strangers—strangers forever!” She repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her.",sadness
265,“And how I loved him!,anger
266,"my God, how I loved him!...",anger
267,How I loved him!,anger
268,And now don’t I love him?,anger
269,Don’t I love him more than before?,anger
270,"The most horrible thing is,” she began, but did not finish her thought, because Matrona Philimonovna put her head in at the door.",anger
271,"“Let us send for my brother,” she said; “he can get a dinner anyway, or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again, like yesterday.” “Very well, I will come directly and see about it.",joy
272,"But did you send for some new milk?” And Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day, and drowned her grief in them for a time.",sadness
273,"Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, thanks to his excellent abilities, but he had been idle and mischievous, and therefore was one of the lowest in his class.",anger
274,"But in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life, his inferior grade in the service, and his comparative youth, he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at Moscow.",anger
275,"This post he had received through his sister Anna’s husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged.",anger
276,"But if Karenin had not got his brother-in-law this berth, then through a hundred other personages—brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and aunts—Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other similar one, together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him, as his affairs, in spite of his wife’s considerable property, were in an embarrassed condition.",sadness
277,Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
278,He was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world.,joy
279,"One-third of the men in the government, the older men, had been friends of his father’s, and had known him in petticoats; another third were his intimate chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances.",joy
280,"Consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of places, rents, shares, and such, were all his friends, and could not overlook one of their own set; and Oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post.",joy
281,"He had only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be quarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did.",joy
282,"It would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required, especially as he expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get, and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man.",anger
283,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor, but for his bright disposition, and his unquestionable honesty.",joy
284,"In him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes, black hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his face, there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him.",joy
285,“Aha!,anger
286,Stiva!,anger
287,Oblonsky!,anger
288,Here he is!” was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him.,joy
289,"Even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened, the next day, and the next, everyone was just as delighted at meeting him again.",joy
290,"After filling for three years the post of president of one of the government boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect, as well as the liking, of his fellow-officials, subordinates, and superiors, and all who had had business with him.",anger
291,"The principal qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his extreme indulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings; secondly, of his perfect liberalism—not the liberalism he read of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his blood, in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same, whatever their fortune or calling might be; and thirdly—the most important point—his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged, in consequence of which he was never carried away, and never made mistakes.",joy
292,"On reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch, escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his little private room, put on his uniform, and went into the boardroom.",anger
293,"The clerks and copyists all rose, greeting him with good-humored deference.",joy
294,"Stepan Arkadyevitch moved quickly, as ever, to his place, shook hands with his colleagues, and sat down.",anger
295,"He made a joke or two, and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum, and began work.",anger
296,"No one knew better than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom, simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business.",anger
297,"A secretary, with the good-humored deference common to everyone in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s office, came up with papers, and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
298,“We have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of Penza.,anger
299,"Here, would you care?...” “You’ve got them at last?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laying his finger on the paper.",anger
300,"“Now, gentlemen....” And the sitting of the board began.",anger
301,"“If they knew,” he thought, bending his head with a significant air as he listened to the report, “what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago.” And his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report.",sadness
302,"Till two o’clock the sitting would go on without a break, and at two o’clock there would be an interval and luncheon.",joy
303,"It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened and someone came in.",anger
304,"All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the Tsar and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked round at the door; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the intruder, and closed the glass door after him.",anger
305,"When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and stretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room.",anger
306,"Two of the members of the board, the old veteran in the service, Nikitin, and the _Kammerjunker_ Grinevitch, went in with him.",anger
307,"“We shall have time to finish after lunch,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
308,“To be sure we shall!” said Nikitin.,joy
309,"“A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,” said Grinevitch of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining.",anger
310,"Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch’s words, giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely, and made him no reply.",anger
311,“Who was that came in?” he asked the doorkeeper.,anger
312,"“Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my back was turned.",anger
313,He was asking for you.,anger
314,"I told him: when the members come out, then....” “Where is he?” “Maybe he’s gone into the passage, but here he comes anyway.",anger
315,"That is he,” said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built, broad-shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his sheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase.",anger
316,"One of the members going down—a lean official with a portfolio—stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky.",anger
317,Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs.,anger
318,His good-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up.,joy
319,"“Why, it’s actually you, Levin, at last!” he said with a friendly mocking smile, scanning Levin as he approached.",joy
320,"“How is it you have deigned to look me up in this den?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and not content with shaking hands, he kissed his friend.",love
321,"“Have you been here long?” “I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,” said Levin, looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.",anger
322,"“Well, let’s go into my room,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who knew his friend’s sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking his arm, he drew him along, as though guiding him through dangers.",anger
323,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian names: old men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and adjutant-generals, so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had, through the medium of Oblonsky, something in common.",fear
324,"He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with everyone, and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums, as he used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his subordinates, he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to diminish the disagreeable impression made on them.",anger
325,"Levin was not a disreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt that Levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his subordinates, and so he made haste to take him off into his room.",sadness
326,Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne.,joy
327,Levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth.,joy
328,"They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth.",love
329,"But in spite of this, each of them—as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds—though in discussion he would even justify the other’s career, in his heart despised it.",anger
330,"It seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life, and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm.",joy
331,Oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of Levin.,joy
332,"How often he had seen him come up to Moscow from the country where he was doing something, but what precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and indeed he took no interest in the matter.",anger
333,"Levin arrived in Moscow always excited and in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease, and for the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of things.",anger
334,"Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it.",anger
335,"In the same way Levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend, and his official duties, which he laughed at, and regarded as trifling.",anger
336,"But the difference was that Oblonsky, as he was doing the same as everyone did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while Levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.",anger
337,"“We have long been expecting you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going into his room and letting Levin’s hand go as though to show that here all danger was over.",joy
338,"“I am very, very glad to see you,” he went on.",joy
339,"“Well, how are you?",anger
340,Eh?,joy
341,"When did you come?” Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky’s two companions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which had such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and such huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed all his attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought.",joy
342,"Oblonsky noticed this at once, and smiled.",joy
343,"“Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,” he said.",joy
344,"“My colleagues: Philip Ivanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch”—and turning to Levin—“a district councilor, a modern district councilman, a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand, a cattle-breeder and sportsman, and my friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev.” “Delighted,” said the veteran.",anger
345,"“I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,” said Grinevitch, holding out his slender hand with its long nails.",anger
346,"Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky.",anger
347,"Though he had a great respect for his half-brother, an author well known to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not as Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.",joy
348,"“No, I am no longer a district councilor.",anger
349,"I have quarreled with them all, and don’t go to the meetings any more,” he said, turning to Oblonsky.",anger
350,“You’ve been quick about it!” said Oblonsky with a smile.,joy
351,“But how?,anger
352,why?” “It’s a long story.,anger
353,"I will tell you some time,” said Levin, but he began telling him at once.",anger
354,"“Well, to put it shortly, I was convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could be,” he began, as though someone had just insulted him.",anger
355,"“On one side it’s a plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I’m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the other side” (he stammered) “it’s a means for the coterie of the district to make money.",anger
356,"Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice, now they have the district council—not in the form of bribes, but in the form of unearned salary,” he said, as hotly as though someone of those present had opposed his opinion.",anger
357,“Aha!,anger
358,"You’re in a new phase again, I see—a conservative,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
359,"“However, we can go into that later.” “Yes, later.",joy
360,"But I wanted to see you,” said Levin, looking with hatred at Grinevitch’s hand.",anger
361,Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.,joy
362,"“How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again?” he said, scanning his new suit, obviously cut by a French tailor.",anger
363,“Ah!,anger
364,"I see: a new phase.” Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without being themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more, almost to the point of tears.",sadness
365,"And it was so strange to see this sensible, manly face in such a childish plight, that Oblonsky left off looking at him.",anger
366,"“Oh, where shall we meet?",joy
367,"You know I want very much to talk to you,” said Levin.",anger
368,Oblonsky seemed to ponder.,anger
369,"“I’ll tell you what: let’s go to Gurin’s to lunch, and there we can talk.",anger
370,"I am free till three.” “No,” answered Levin, after an instant’s thought, “I have got to go on somewhere else.” “All right, then, let’s dine together.” “Dine together?",joy
371,"But I have nothing very particular, only a few words to say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk afterwards.” “Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we’ll gossip after dinner.” “Well, it’s this,” said Levin; “but it’s of no importance, though.” His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness.",sadness
372,“What are the Shtcherbatskys doing?,joy
373,Everything as it used to be?” he said.,anger
374,"Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes sparkled merrily.",joy
375,"“You said a few words, but I can’t answer in a few words, because....",anger
376,"Excuse me a minute....” A secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to Oblonsky with some papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, to explain some objection.",anger
377,"Stepan Arkadyevitch, without hearing him out, laid his hand genially on the secretary’s sleeve.",anger
378,"“No, you do as I told you,” he said, softening his words with a smile, and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away from the papers, and said: “So do it that way, if you please, Zahar Nikititch.” The secretary retired in confusion.",sadness
379,During the consultation with the secretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment.,sadness
380,"He was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair, and on his face was a look of ironical attention.",anger
381,"“I don’t understand it, I don’t understand it,” he said.",anger
382,"“What don’t you understand?” said Oblonsky, smiling as brightly as ever, and picking up a cigarette.",anger
383,He expected some queer outburst from Levin.,anger
384,"“I don’t understand what you are doing,” said Levin, shrugging his shoulders.",joy
385,"“How can you do it seriously?” “Why not?” “Why, because there’s nothing in it.” “You think so, but we’re overwhelmed with work.” “On paper.",fear
386,"But, there, you’ve a gift for it,” added Levin.",joy
387,"“That’s to say, you think there’s a lack of something in me?” “Perhaps so,” said Levin.",anger
388,"“But all the same I admire your grandeur, and am proud that I’ve a friend in such a great person.",joy
389,"You’ve not answered my question, though,” he went on, with a desperate effort looking Oblonsky straight in the face.",anger
390,"“Oh, that’s all very well.",joy
391,"You wait a bit, and you’ll come to this yourself.",anger
392,"It’s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness of a girl of twelve; still you’ll be one of us one day.",joy
393,"Yes, as to your question, there is no change, but it’s a pity you’ve been away so long.” “Oh, why so?” Levin queried, panic-stricken.",fear
394,"“Oh, nothing,” responded Oblonsky.",anger
395,“We’ll talk it over.,anger
396,"But what’s brought you up to town?” “Oh, we’ll talk about that, too, later on,” said Levin, reddening again up to his ears.",anger
397,“All right.,anger
398,"I see,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
399,"“I should ask you to come to us, you know, but my wife’s not quite the thing.",anger
400,"But I tell you what; if you want to see them, they’re sure now to be at the Zoological Gardens from four to five.",joy
401,Kitty skates.,anger
402,"You drive along there, and I’ll come and fetch you, and we’ll go and dine somewhere together.” “Capital.",anger
403,"So good-bye till then.” “Now mind, you’ll forget, I know you, or rush off home to the country!” Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.",anger
404,"“No, truly!” And Levin went out of the room, only when he was in the doorway remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky’s colleagues.",anger
405,"“That gentleman must be a man of great energy,” said Grinevitch, when Levin had gone away.",anger
406,"“Yes, my dear boy,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, nodding his head, “he’s a lucky fellow!",joy
407,Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district; everything before him; and what youth and vigor!,joy
408,"Not like some of us.” “You have a great deal to complain of, haven’t you, Stepan Arkadyevitch?” “Ah, yes, I’m in a poor way, a bad way,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh.",sadness
409,"When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin blushed, and was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer, “I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer,” though that was precisely what he had come for.",anger
410,"The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble Moscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms.",joy
411,This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin’s student days.,joy
412,"He had both prepared for the university with the young Prince Shtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and had entered at the same time with him.",anger
413,"In those days Levin used often to be in the Shtcherbatskys’ house, and he was in love with the Shtcherbatsky household.",anger
414,"Strange as it may appear, it was with the household, the family, that Konstantin Levin was in love, especially with the feminine half of the household.",anger
415,"Levin did not remember his own mother, and his only sister was older than he was, so that it was in the Shtcherbatskys’ house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old, noble, cultivated, and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father and mother.",sadness
416,"All the members of that family, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him, as it were, wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection.",joy
417,"Why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were audible in their brother’s room above, where the students used to work; why they were visited by those professors of French literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat—all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good, and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings.",joy
418,"In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly, but she was soon married to Oblonsky.",anger
419,Then he began being in love with the second.,anger
420,"He felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of the sisters, only he could not quite make out which.",joy
421,"But Natalia, too, had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat Lvov.",anger
422,Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university.,anger
423,"Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and Levin’s relations with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his friendship with Oblonsky, became less intimate.",anger
424,"But when early in the winter of this year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and saw the Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love.",anger
425,"One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a man of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match.",joy
426,"But Levin was in love, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her.",joy
427,"After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing Kitty almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet her, he abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the country.",sadness
428,"Levin’s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him.",joy
429,"In her family’s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in society, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two, were already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director of a bank and railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky.",sadness
430,"But he (he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit for nothing else.",joy
431,"The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary, in no way striking person.",joy
432,"Moreover, his attitude to Kitty in the past—the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his friendship with her brother—seemed to him yet another obstacle to love.",sadness
433,"An ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he supposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still more, a distinguished man.",joy
434,"He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional women.",joy
435,"But after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant’s rest; that he could not live without deciding the question, would she or would she not be his wife, and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings, that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected.",sadness
436,"And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to make an offer, and get married if he were accepted.",joy
437,Or ... he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected.,anger
438,"On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house of his elder half-brother, Koznishev.",anger
439,"After changing his clothes he went down to his brother’s study, intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit, and to ask his advice; but his brother was not alone.",anger
440,"With him there was a well-known professor of philosophy, who had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question.",joy
441,The professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists.,anger
442,"Sergey Koznishev had been following this crusade with interest, and after reading the professor’s last article, he had written him a letter stating his objections.",anger
443,He accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists.,anger
444,And the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out.,anger
445,The point in discussion was the question then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between psychological and physiological phenomena in man?,anger
446,"and if so, where?",anger
447,"Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone, and introducing him to the professor, went on with the conversation.",anger
448,"A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him.",anger
449,"Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go, but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion.",anger
450,"Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development of the first principles of science, familiar to him as a natural science student at the university.",joy
451,"But he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal, as to reflex action, biology, and sociology, with those questions as to the meaning of life and death to himself, which had of late been more and more often in his mind.",sadness
452,"As he listened to his brother’s argument with the professor, he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems, that at times they almost touched on the latter; but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point, they promptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions, reservations, quotations, allusions, and appeals to authorities, and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about.",joy
453,"“I cannot admit it,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his habitual clearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase.",joy
454,“I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions.,joy
455,"The most fundamental idea, the idea of existence, has not been received by me through sensation; indeed, there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an idea.” “Yes, but they—Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov—would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations, that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations.",joy
456,"Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no sensations, it follows that there is no idea of existence.” “I maintain the contrary,” began Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
457,"But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor.",anger
458,"“According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I can have no existence of any sort?” he queried.",sadness
459,"The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering at the interruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more like a bargeman than a philosopher, and turned his eyes upon Sergey Ivanovitch, as though to ask: What’s one to say to him?",anger
460,"But Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness than the professor, and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor, and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put, smiled and said: “That question we have no right to answer as yet.” “We have not the requisite data,” chimed in the professor, and he went back to his argument.",anger
461,"“No,” he said; “I would point out the fact that if, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based on sensation, then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions.” Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to go.",joy
462,"When the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his brother.",anger
463,“Delighted that you’ve come.,anger
464,"For some time, is it?",anger
465,"How’s your farming getting on?” Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming, and only put the question in deference to him, and so he only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters.",anger
466,"Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married, and to ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so.",anger
467,"But after seeing his brother, listening to his conversation with the professor, hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters (their mother’s property had not been divided, and Levin took charge of both their shares), Levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to him of his intention of marrying.",joy
468,He felt that his brother would not look at it as he would have wished him to.,sadness
469,"“Well, how is your district council doing?” asked Sergey Ivanovitch, who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great importance to them.",joy
470,“I really don’t know.” “What!,anger
471,"Why, surely you’re a member of the board?” “No, I’m not a member now; I’ve resigned,” answered Levin, “and I no longer attend the meetings.” “What a pity!” commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.",sadness
472,Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings in his district.,anger
473,“That’s how it always is!” Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.,anger
474,“We Russians are always like that.,joy
475,"Perhaps it’s our strong point, really, the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues.",joy
476,"All I say is, give such rights as our local self-government to any other European people—why, the Germans or the English would have worked their way to freedom from them, while we simply turn them into ridicule.” “But how can it be helped?” said Levin penitently.",joy
477,“It was my last effort.,anger
478,And I did try with all my soul.,anger
479,I can’t.,anger
480,"I’m no good at it.” “It’s not that you’re no good at it,” said Sergey Ivanovitch; “it is that you don’t look at it as you should.” “Perhaps not,” Levin answered dejectedly.",joy
481,“Oh!,anger
482,"do you know brother Nikolay’s turned up again?” This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and half-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living in the strangest and lowest company, and had quarreled with his brothers.",anger
483,“What did you say?” Levin cried with horror.,sadness
484,“How do you know?” “Prokofy saw him in the street.” “Here in Moscow?,anger
485,Where is he?,anger
486,"Do you know?” Levin got up from his chair, as though on the point of starting off at once.",anger
487,"“I am sorry I told you,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head at his younger brother’s excitement.",joy
488,"“I sent to find out where he is living, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid.",anger
489,This is the answer he sent me.” And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed it to his brother.,anger
490,"Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: “I humbly beg you to leave me in peace.",anger
491,"That’s the only favor I ask of my gracious brothers.—Nikolay Levin.” Levin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
492,"There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it would be base to do so.",sadness
493,"“He obviously wants to offend me,” pursued Sergey Ivanovitch; “but he cannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my heart to assist him, but I know it’s impossible to do that.” “Yes, yes,” repeated Levin.",anger
494,"“I understand and appreciate your attitude to him; but I shall go and see him.” “If you want to, do; but I shouldn’t advise it,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
495,"“As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; he will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I should say you would do better not to go.",anger
496,"You can’t do him any good; still, do as you please.” “Very likely I can’t do any good, but I feel—especially at such a moment—but that’s another thing—I feel I could not be at peace.” “Well, that I don’t understand,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
497,"“One thing I do understand,” he added; “it’s a lesson in humility.",anger
498,"I have come to look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous since brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he did....” “Oh, it’s awful, awful!” repeated Levin.",sadness
499,"After obtaining his brother’s address from Sergey Ivanovitch’s footman, Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him, but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening.",anger
500,The first thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to Moscow for.,anger
501,"From his brother’s Levin went to Oblonsky’s office, and on getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place where he had been told he might find Kitty.",anger
502,"At four o’clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped out of a hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he would certainly find her there, as he had seen the Shtcherbatskys’ carriage at the entrance.",anger
503,"It was a bright, frosty day.",anger
504,"Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and policemen were standing in the approach.",anger
505,"Crowds of well-dressed people, with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the well-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the Russian style.",joy
506,"The old curly birches of the gardens, all their twigs laden with snow, looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments.",joy
507,"He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to himself—“You mustn’t be excited, you must be calm.",joy
508,What’s the matter with you?,anger
509,What do you want?,anger
510,"Be quiet, stupid,” he conjured his heart.",anger
511,"And the more he tried to compose himself, the more breathless he found himself.",anger
512,"An acquaintance met him and called him by his name, but Levin did not even recognize him.",anger
513,"He went towards the mounds, whence came the clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up, the rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry voices.",joy
514,"He walked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay open before his eyes, and at once, amidst all the skaters, he knew her.",anger
515,He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his heart.,anger
516,She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground.,anger
517,There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude.,anger
518,But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles.,joy
519,Everything was made bright by her.,joy
520,She was the smile that shed light on all round her.,joy
521,"“Is it possible I can go over there on the ice, go up to her?” he thought.",anger
522,"The place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment when he was almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror.",fear
523,"He had to make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her, and that he too might come there to skate.",joy
524,"He walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun, but seeing her, as one does the sun, without looking.",anger
525,"On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all acquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice.",anger
526,"There were crack skaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs with timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with hygienic motives.",fear
527,"They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here, near her.",joy
528,"All the skaters, it seemed, with perfect self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke to her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather.",joy
529,"Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in a short jacket and tight trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on.",anger
530,"Seeing Levin, he shouted to him: “Ah, the first skater in Russia!",anger
531,Been here long?,anger
532,"First-rate ice—do put your skates on.” “I haven’t got my skates,” Levin answered, marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her, though he did not look at her.",joy
533,He felt as though the sun were coming near him.,joy
534,"She was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towards him.",anger
535,"A boy in Russian dress, desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground, overtook her.",fear
536,"She skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for emergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him, and at her own fears.",fear
537,"When she had got round the turn, she gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to Shtcherbatsky.",anger
538,"Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin.",joy
539,She was more splendid than he had imagined her.,joy
540,"When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and good humor.",joy
541,"The childishness of her expression, together with the delicate beauty of her figure, made up her special charm, and that he fully realized.",joy
542,"But what always struck him in her as something unlooked for, was the expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and above all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted world, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he remembered himself in some days of his early childhood.",love
543,"“Have you been here long?” she said, giving him her hand.",anger
544,"“Thank you,” she added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff.",anger
545,“I?,anger
546,I’ve not long ... yesterday ...,anger
547,I mean today ...,anger
548,"I arrived,” answered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her question.",joy
549,"“I was meaning to come and see you,” he said; and then, recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her, he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed.",sadness
550,"“I didn’t know you could skate, and skate so well.” She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion.",joy
551,“Your praise is worth having.,joy
552,"The tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters,” she said, with her little black-gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.",anger
553,"“Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.” “You do everything with passion, I think,” she said smiling.",joy
554,“I should so like to see how you skate.,joy
555,"Put on skates, and let us skate together.” “Skate together!",anger
556,"Can that be possible?” thought Levin, gazing at her.",joy
557,"“I’ll put them on directly,” he said.",anger
558,And he went off to get skates.,anger
559,"“It’s a long while since we’ve seen you here, sir,” said the attendant, supporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the skate.",anger
560,"“Except you, there’s none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters.",joy
561,"Will that be all right?” said he, tightening the strap.",anger
562,"“Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,” answered Levin, with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face.",sadness
563,"“Yes,” he thought, “this now is life, this is happiness!",joy
564,"_Together,_ she said; _let us skate together!_ Speak to her now?",anger
565,"But that’s just why I’m afraid to speak—because I’m happy now, happy in hope, anyway.... And then?...",joy
566,But I must!,anger
567,I must!,anger
568,I must!,anger
569,"Away with weakness!” Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over the rough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort, as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and slackening speed and turning his course.",anger
570,"He approached with timidity, but again her smile reassured him.",joy
571,"She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and faster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand.",anger
572,"“With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,” she said to him.",joy
573,"“And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,” he said, but was at once panic-stricken at what he had said, and blushed.",joy
574,"And indeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when all at once, like the sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all its friendliness, and Levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the working of thought; a crease showed on her smooth brow.",joy
575,"“Is there anything troubling you?—though I’ve no right to ask such a question,” he added hurriedly.",anger
576,"“Oh, why so?...",anger
577,"No, I have nothing to trouble me,” she responded coldly; and she added immediately: “You haven’t seen Mlle.",anger
578,"Linon, have you?” “Not yet.” “Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.” “What’s wrong?",anger
579,I have offended her.,anger
580,"Lord help me!” thought Levin, and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was sitting on a bench.",anger
581,"Smiling and showing her false teeth, she greeted him as an old friend.",joy
582,"“Yes, you see we’re growing up,” she said to him, glancing towards Kitty, “and growing old.",anger
583,"_Tiny bear_ has grown big now!” pursued the Frenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the English nursery tale.",anger
584,"“Do you remember that’s what you used to call them?” He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now, and was fond of it.",anger
585,"“Now, go and skate, go and skate.",joy
586,"Our Kitty has learned to skate nicely, hasn’t she?” When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate composure.",joy
587,And he felt depressed.,sadness
588,"After talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities, she questioned him about his life.",anger
589,"“Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren’t you?” she said.",sadness
590,"“No, I’m not dull, I am very busy,” he said, feeling that she was holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the force to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the winter.",sadness
591,“Are you going to stay in town long?” Kitty questioned him.,anger
592,"“I don’t know,” he answered, not thinking of what he was saying.",anger
593,"The thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.",anger
594,“How is it you don’t know?” “I don’t know.,anger
595,"It depends upon you,” he said, and was immediately horror-stricken at his own words.",anger
596,"Whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want to hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and hurriedly skated away from him.",anger
597,She skated up to Mlle.,anger
598,"Linon, said something to her, and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates.",anger
599,“My God!,anger
600,what have I done!,anger
601,Merciful God!,anger
602,"help me, guide me,” said Levin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of violent exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.",anger
603,"At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the day, came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigarette in his mouth.",anger
604,"Taking a run, he dashed down the steps in his skates, crashing and bounding up and down.",anger
605,"He flew down, and without even changing the position of his hands, skated away over the ice.",anger
606,"“Ah, that’s a new trick!” said Levin, and he promptly ran up to the top to do this new trick.",joy
607,“Don’t break your neck!,anger
608,it needs practice!” Nikolay Shtcherbatsky shouted after him.,anger
609,"Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands.",anger
610,"On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off, laughing.",anger
611,"“How splendid, how nice he is!” Kitty was thinking at that time, as she came out of the pavilion with Mlle.",joy
612,"Linon, and looked towards him with a smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother.",joy
613,"“And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",anger
614,They talk of flirtation.,anger
615,"I know it’s not he that I love; but still I am happy with him, and he’s so jolly.",joy
616,"Only, why did he say that?...” she mused.",anger
617,"Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the steps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still and pondered a minute.",anger
618,"He took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens.",joy
619,"“Delighted to see you,” said Princess Shtcherbatskaya.",anger
620,"“On Thursdays we are home, as always.” “Today, then?” “We shall be pleased to see you,” the princess said stiffly.",joy
621,"This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mother’s coldness.",anger
622,"She turned her head, and with a smile said: “Good-bye till this evening.” At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.",joy
623,"But as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly’s health.",anger
624,"After a little subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out his chest again, and put his arm in Levin’s.",sadness
625,"“Well, shall we set off?” he asked.",anger
626,"“I’ve been thinking about you all this time, and I’m very, very glad you’ve come,” he said, looking him in the face with a significant air.",joy
627,"“Yes, come along,” answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying, “Good-bye till this evening,” and seeing the smile with which it was said.",joy
628,"“To the England or the Hermitage?” “I don’t mind which.” “All right, then, the England,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the Hermitage, and consequently considered it mean to avoid it.",anger
629,“Have you got a sledge?,anger
630,"That’s first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.” The friends hardly spoke all the way.",anger
631,"Levin was wondering what that change in Kitty’s expression had meant, and alternately assuring himself that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly that his hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man, utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words, “Good-bye till this evening.” Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner.",anger
632,"“You like turbot, don’t you?” he said to Levin as they were arriving.",joy
633,“Eh?” responded Levin.,anger
634,“Turbot?,anger
635,"Yes, I’m _awfully_ fond of turbot.” When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained radiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
636,"Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining-room, giving directions to the Tatar waiters, who were clustered about him in evening coats, bearing napkins.",joy
637,"Bowing to right and left to the people he met, and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances, he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter.",joy
638,"Levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair, _poudre de riz,_ and _vinaigre de toilette_.",joy
639,"He made haste to move away from her, as from a dirty place.",anger
640,"His whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes.",joy
641,"“This way, your excellency, please.",anger
642,"Your excellency won’t be disturbed here,” said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind.",sadness
643,"“Walk in, your excellency,” he said to Levin; by way of showing his respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.",joy
644,"Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he pushed up velvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands, awaiting his commands.",anger
645,"“If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free directly; Prince Golistin with a lady.",joy
646,Fresh oysters have come in.” “Ah!,joy
647,oysters.” Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.,joy
648,"“How if we were to change our program, Levin?” he said, keeping his finger on the bill of fare.",anger
649,And his face expressed serious hesitation.,joy
650,“Are the oysters good?,joy
651,"Mind now.” “They’re Flensburg, your excellency.",joy
652,"We’ve no Ostend.” “Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?” “Only arrived yesterday.” “Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",joy
653,Eh?” “It’s all the same to me.,anger
654,"I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything; but of course there’s nothing like that here.” “_Porridge à la Russe,_ your honor would like?” said the Tatar, bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.",sadness
655,"“No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good.",joy
656,"I’ve been skating, and I’m hungry.",anger
657,"And don’t imagine,” he added, detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky’s face, “that I shan’t appreciate your choice.",joy
658,I am fond of good things.” “I should hope so!,love
659,"After all, it’s one of the pleasures of life,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
660,"“Well, then, my friend, you give us two—or better say three—dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables....” “_Printanière,_” prompted the Tatar.",joy
661,But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French names of the dishes.,joy
662,"“With vegetables in it, you know.",anger
663,"Then turbot with thick sauce, then ... roast beef; and mind it’s good.",joy
664,"Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then sweets.” The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch’s way not to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not repeat them after him, but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill:—“_Soupe printanière, turbot, sauce Beaumarchais, poulard à l’estragon, macédoine de fruits_ ... etc.,” and then instantly, as though worked by springs, laying down one bound bill of fare, he took up another, the list of wines, and submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
665,"“What shall we drink?” “What you like, only not too much.",anger
666,"Champagne,” said Levin.",anger
667,“What!,anger
668,to start with?,anger
669,"You’re right though, I dare say.",anger
670,"Do you like the white seal?” “_Cachet blanc,_” prompted the Tatar.",joy
671,"“Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then we’ll see.” “Yes, sir.",joy
672,And what table wine?” “You can give us Nuits.,anger
673,"Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.” “Yes, sir.",joy
674,"And _your_ cheese, your excellency?” “Oh, yes, Parmesan.",joy
675,"Or would you like another?” “No, it’s all the same to me,” said Levin, unable to suppress a smile.",joy
676,"And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and a bottle between his fingers.",anger
677,"Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his waistcoat, and settling his arms comfortably, started on the oysters.",anger
678,"“Not bad,” he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a silver fork, and swallowing them one after another.",anger
679,"“Not bad,” he repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar.",anger
680,"Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have pleased him better.",joy
681,But he was admiring Oblonsky.,anger
682,"Even the Tatar, uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction.",joy
683,"“You don’t care much for oysters, do you?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, emptying his wine-glass, “or you’re worried about something.",fear
684,Eh?” He wanted Levin to be in good spirits.,joy
685,But it was not that Levin was not in good spirits; he was ill at ease.,joy
686,"With what he had in his soul, he felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and bustle; the surroundings of bronzes, looking-glasses, gas, and waiters—all of it was offensive to him.",anger
687,He was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of.,fear
688,“I?,anger
689,"Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,” he said.",anger
690,"“You can’t conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me, as queer as that gentleman’s nails I saw at your place....” “Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch’s nails,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.",anger
691,"“It’s too much for me,” responded Levin.",anger
692,"“Do try, now, and put yourself in my place, take the point of view of a country person.",anger
693,We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with.,joy
694,So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up our sleeves.,anger
695,"And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will, and link on small saucers by way of studs, so that they can do nothing with their hands.” Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.",joy
696,"“Oh, yes, that’s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work.",anger
697,His work is with the mind....” “Maybe.,joy
698,"But still it’s queer to me, just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating oysters....” “Why, of course,” objected Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
699,"“But that’s just the aim of civilization—to make everything a source of enjoyment.” “Well, if that’s its aim, I’d rather be a savage.” “And so you are a savage.",anger
700,All you Levins are savages.” Levin sighed.,anger
701,"He remembered his brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and sore, and he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention.",sadness
702,"“Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the Shtcherbatskys’, I mean?” he said, his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells, and drew the cheese towards him.",anger
703,"“Yes, I shall certainly go,” replied Levin; “though I fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation.” “What nonsense!",joy
704,"That’s her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!...",anger
705,"That’s her manner—_grande dame,_” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
706,"“I’m coming, too, but I have to go to the Countess Bonina’s rehearsal.",anger
707,"Come, isn’t it true that you’re a savage?",anger
708,How do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from Moscow?,anger
709,"The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me about you, as though I ought to know.",anger
710,"The only thing I know is that you always do what no one else does.” “Yes,” said Levin, slowly and with emotion, “you’re right.",joy
711,I am a savage.,anger
712,"Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but in coming now.",anger
713,"Now I have come....” “Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!” broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch, looking into Levin’s eyes.",anger
714,"“Why?” “‘I know a gallant steed by tokens sure, And by his eyes I know a youth in love,’” declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
715,"“Everything is before you.” “Why, is it over for you already?” “No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is mine, and the present—well, it’s not all that it might be.” “How so?” “Oh, things go wrong.",anger
716,"But I don’t want to talk of myself, and besides I can’t explain it all,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
717,"“Well, why have you come to Moscow, then?...",anger
718,Hi!,joy
719,take away!” he called to the Tatar.,anger
720,"“You guess?” responded Levin, his eyes like deep wells of light fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
721,"“I guess, but I can’t be the first to talk about it.",anger
722,"You can see by that whether I guess right or wrong,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, gazing at Levin with a subtle smile.",joy
723,"“Well, and what have you to say to me?” said Levin in a quivering voice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too.",fear
724,"“How do you look at the question?” Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis, never taking his eyes off Levin.",anger
725,"“I?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “there’s nothing I desire so much as that—nothing!",joy
726,It would be the best thing that could be.” “But you’re not making a mistake?,anger
727,"You know what we’re speaking of?” said Levin, piercing him with his eyes.",anger
728,“You think it’s possible?” “I think it’s possible.,joy
729,Why not possible?” “No!,joy
730,do you really think it’s possible?,joy
731,"No, tell me all you think!",anger
732,"Oh, but if ... if refusal’s in store for me!...",anger
733,"Indeed I feel sure....” “Why should you think that?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling at his excitement.",joy
734,“It seems so to me sometimes.,anger
735,"That will be awful for me, and for her too.” “Oh, well, anyway there’s nothing awful in it for a girl.",sadness
736,"Every girl’s proud of an offer.” “Yes, every girl, but not she.” Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.",joy
737,"He so well knew that feeling of Levin’s, that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one class—all the girls in the world except her, and those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls: the other class—she alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity.",sadness
738,"“Stay, take some sauce,” he said, holding back Levin’s hand as it pushed away the sauce.",anger
739,"Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan Arkadyevitch go on with his dinner.",anger
740,"“No, stop a minute, stop a minute,” he said.",anger
741,“You must understand that it’s a question of life and death for me.,anger
742,I have never spoken to anyone of this.,anger
743,"And there’s no one I could speak of it to, except you.",anger
744,"You know we’re utterly unlike each other, different tastes and views and everything; but I know you’re fond of me and understand me, and that’s why I like you awfully.",sadness
745,"But for God’s sake, be quite straightforward with me.” “I tell you what I think,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",joy
746,"“But I’ll say more: my wife is a wonderful woman....” Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, remembering his position with his wife, and, after a moment’s silence, resumed—“She has a gift of foreseeing things.",joy
747,"She sees right through people; but that’s not all; she knows what will come to pass, especially in the way of marriages.",joy
748,"She foretold, for instance, that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln.",anger
749,"No one would believe it, but it came to pass.",anger
750,"And she’s on your side.” “How do you mean?” “It’s not only that she likes you—she says that Kitty is certain to be your wife.” At these words Levin’s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile not far from tears of emotion.",sadness
751,“She says that!” cried Levin.,anger
752,"“I always said she was exquisite, your wife.",anger
753,"There, that’s enough, enough said about it,” he said, getting up from his seat.",anger
754,"“All right, but do sit down.” But Levin could not sit down.",anger
755,"He walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall, and only then sat down to the table.",anger
756,"“You must understand,” said he, “it’s not love.",anger
757,"I’ve been in love, but it’s not that.",joy
758,"It’s not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me.",joy
759,"I went away, you see, because I made up my mind that it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not come on earth; but I’ve struggled with myself, I see there’s no living without it.",sadness
760,"And it must be settled.” “What did you go away for?” “Ah, stop a minute!",anger
761,"Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one!",joy
762,The questions one must ask oneself!,anger
763,Listen.,anger
764,You can’t imagine what you’ve done for me by what you said.,anger
765,I’m so happy that I’ve become positively hateful; I’ve forgotten everything.,anger
766,"I heard today that my brother Nikolay ... you know, he’s here ...",anger
767,I had even forgotten him.,sadness
768,It seems to me that he’s happy too.,joy
769,It’s a sort of madness.,anger
770,But one thing’s awful....,sadness
771,"Here, you’ve been married, you know the feeling ... it’s awful that we—old—with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it’s loathsome, and that’s why one can’t help feeling oneself unworthy.” “Oh, well, you’ve not many sins on your conscience.” “Alas!",sadness
772,"all the same,” said Levin, “when with loathing I go over my life, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it.... Yes.” “What would you have?",sadness
773,"The world’s made so,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
774,"“The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked: ‘Forgive me not according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy loving-kindness.’ That’s the only way she can forgive me.” Levin emptied his glass, and they were silent for a while.",love
775,“There’s one other thing I ought to tell you.,anger
776,Do you know Vronsky?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.,anger
777,"“No, I don’t.",anger
778,"Why do you ask?” “Give us another bottle,” Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar, who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not wanted.",anger
779,"“Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he’s one of your rivals.” “Who’s Vronsky?” said Levin, and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression.",anger
780,"“Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg.",joy
781,"I made his acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came there for the levy of recruits.",anger
782,"Fearfully rich, handsome, great connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice, good-natured fellow.",joy
783,"But he’s more than simply a good-natured fellow, as I’ve found out here—he’s a cultivated man, too, and very intelligent; he’s a man who’ll make his mark.” Levin scowled and was dumb.",joy
784,"“Well, he turned up here soon after you’d gone, and as I can see, he’s over head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her mother....” “Excuse me, but I know nothing,” said Levin, frowning gloomily.",anger
785,And immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was to have been able to forget him.,anger
786,"“You wait a bit, wait a bit,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling and touching his hand.",anger
787,"“I’ve told you what I know, and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I believe the chances are in your favor.” Levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.",anger
788,"“But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be,” pursued Oblonsky, filling up his glass.",anger
789,"“No, thanks, I can’t drink any more,” said Levin, pushing away his glass.",anger
790,"“I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how are you getting on?” he went on, obviously anxious to change the conversation.",fear
791,“One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.,anger
792,"Tonight I don’t advise you to speak,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
793,"“Go round tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless you....” “Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting?",joy
794,"Come next spring, do,” said Levin.",joy
795,Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch.,joy
796,"A feeling such as his was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer, of the suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
797,Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.,joy
798,He knew what was passing in Levin’s soul.,anger
799,"“I’ll come some day,” he said.",anger
800,"“But women, my boy, they’re the pivot everything turns upon.",anger
801,"Things are in a bad way with me, very bad.",sadness
802,And it’s all through women.,anger
803,"Tell me frankly now,” he pursued, picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass; “give me your advice.” “Why, what is it?” “I’ll tell you.",anger
804,"Suppose you’re married, you love your wife, but you’re fascinated by another woman....” “Excuse me, but I’m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I can’t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go straight to a baker’s shop and steal a roll.” Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled more than usual.",joy
805,“Why not?,joy
806,"A roll will sometimes smell so good one can’t resist it.” “Himmlisch ist’s, wenn ich bezwungen Meine irdische Begier; Aber doch wenn’s nich gelungen Hatt’ ich auch recht hübsch Plaisir!” As he said this, Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly.",joy
807,"Levin, too, could not help smiling.",joy
808,"“Yes, but joking apart,” resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch, “you must understand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and lonely, and has sacrificed everything.",love
809,"Now, when the thing’s done, don’t you see, can one possibly cast her off?",anger
810,"Even supposing one parts from her, so as not to break up one’s family life, still, can one help feeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?” “Well, you must excuse me there.",sadness
811,"You know to me all women are divided into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and there are ... I’ve never seen exquisite fallen beings, and I never shall see them, but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind, and all fallen women are the same.” “But the Magdalen?” “Ah, drop that!",sadness
812,Christ would never have said those words if He had known how they would be abused.,sadness
813,Of all the Gospel those words are the only ones remembered.,joy
814,"However, I’m not saying so much what I think, as what I feel.",joy
815,I have a loathing for fallen women.,sadness
816,"You’re afraid of spiders, and I of these vermin.",fear
817,Most likely you’ve not made a study of spiders and don’t know their character; and so it is with me.” “It’s very well for you to talk like that; it’s very much like that gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder.,anger
818,But to deny the facts is no answer.,anger
819,"What’s to be done—you tell me that, what’s to be done?",anger
820,"Your wife gets older, while you’re full of life.",joy
821,"Before you’ve time to look round, you feel that you can’t love your wife with love, however much you may esteem her.",joy
822,"And then all at once love turns up, and you’re done for, done for,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.",sadness
823,Levin half smiled.,joy
824,"“Yes, you’re done for,” resumed Oblonsky.",joy
825,“But what’s to be done?” “Don’t steal rolls.” Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.,anger
826,"“Oh, moralist!",anger
827,"But you must understand, there are two women; one insists only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you can’t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing.",sadness
828,What are you to do?,anger
829,How are you to act?,anger
830,"There’s a fearful tragedy in it.” “If you care for my profession of faith as regards that, I’ll tell you that I don’t believe there was any tragedy about it.",anger
831,And this is why.,anger
832,"To my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato defines in his Banquet, served as the test of men.",joy
833,"Some men only understand one sort, and some only the other.",anger
834,And those who only know the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy.,sadness
835,In such love there can be no sort of tragedy.,anger
836,"‘I’m much obliged for the gratification, my humble respects’—that’s all the tragedy.",joy
837,"And in platonic love there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is clear and pure, because....” At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through.",joy
838,And he added unexpectedly: “But perhaps you are right.,joy
839,Very likely ...,joy
840,"I don’t know, I don’t know.” “It’s this, don’t you see,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “you’re very much all of a piece.",anger
841,That’s your strong point and your failing.,anger
842,"You have a character that’s all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too—but that’s not how it is.",joy
843,You despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim—and that’s not how it is.,anger
844,"You want a man’s work, too, always to have a defined aim, and love and family life always to be undivided—and that’s not how it is.",joy
845,"All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow.” Levin sighed and made no reply.",anger
846,"He was thinking of his own affairs, and did not hear Oblonsky.",joy
847,"And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though they had been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn them closer, yet each was thinking only of his own affairs, and they had nothing to do with one another.",joy
848,"Oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness, instead of intimacy, coming on after dinner, and he knew what to do in such cases.",joy
849,"“Bill!” he called, and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector.",anger
850,"And at once in the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin, which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain.",joy
851,"When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd kopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have been horrified, like anyone from the country, at his share of fourteen roubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys’ there to decide his fate.",anger
852,The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen.,joy
853,It was the first winter that she had been out in the world.,anger
854,"Her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even than her mother had anticipated.",anger
855,"To say nothing of the young men who danced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty, two serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance: Levin, and immediately after his departure, Count Vronsky.",sadness
856,"Levin’s appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent visits, and evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious conversations between Kitty’s parents as to her future, and to disputes between them.",anger
857,The prince was on Levin’s side; he said he wished for nothing better for Kitty.,joy
858,"The princess for her part, going round the question in the manner peculiar to women, maintained that Kitty was too young, that Levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions, that Kitty felt no great attraction to him, and other side issues; but she did not state the principal point, which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter, and that Levin was not to her liking, and she did not understand him.",sadness
859,"When Levin had abruptly departed, the princess was delighted, and said to her husband triumphantly: “You see I was right.” When Vronsky appeared on the scene, she was still more delighted, confirmed in her opinion that Kitty was to make not simply a good, but a brilliant match.",joy
860,In the mother’s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and Levin.,anger
861,"She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pride and his queer sort of life, as she considered it, absorbed in cattle and peasants.",anger
862,"She did not very much like it that he, who was in love with her daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he were waiting for something, inspecting, as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not realize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear.",joy
863,"And suddenly, without doing so, he disappeared.",fear
864,"“It’s as well he’s not attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him,” thought the mother.",joy
865,Vronsky satisfied all the mother’s desires.,joy
866,"Very wealthy, clever, of aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court, and a fascinating man.",joy
867,Nothing better could be wished for.,joy
868,"Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, and came continually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions.",joy
869,"But, in spite of that, the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation.",sadness
870,"Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her aunt arranging the match.",anger
871,"Her husband, about whom everything was well known beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked at.",anger
872,The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression.,joy
873,That impression had been favorable.,joy
874,"Afterwards, on a day fixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and accepted.",anger
875,All had passed very simply and easily.,anger
876,"So it seemed, at least, to the princess.",anger
877,"But over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business, apparently so commonplace, of marrying off one’s daughters.",joy
878,"The panics that had been lived through, the thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been wasted, and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls, Darya and Natalia!",sadness
879,"Now, since the youngest had come out, she was going through the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls.",anger
880,"The old prince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters.",anger
881,"He was irrationally jealous over his daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his favorite.",anger
882,At every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter.,anger
883,"The princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters, but now she felt that there was more ground for the prince’s touchiness.",joy
884,"She saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society, that a mother’s duties had become still more difficult.",anger
885,"She saw that girls of Kitty’s age formed some sort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men’s society; drove about the streets alone, many of them did not curtsey, and, what was the most important thing, all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair, and not their parents’.",joy
886,"“Marriages aren’t made nowadays as they used to be,” was thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their elders.",joy
887,"But how marriages were made now, the princess could not learn from anyone.",anger
888,The French fashion—of the parents arranging their children’s future—was not accepted; it was condemned.,anger
889,"The English fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted, and not possible in Russian society.",joy
890,"The Russian fashion of matchmaking by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered unseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone, and by the princess herself.",anger
891,"But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them, no one knew.",anger
892,"Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing: “Mercy on us, it’s high time in our day to cast off all that old-fashioned business.",joy
893,"It’s the young people have to marry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose.” It was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other, her daughter might fall in love, and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband.",sadness
894,"And, however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves, she was unable to believe it, just as she would have been unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols.",sadness
895,And so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her elder sisters.,fear
896,Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter.,fear
897,"She saw that her daughter was in love with him, but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man, and would not do this.",joy
898,"But at the same time she knew how easy it is, with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl’s head, and how lightly men generally regard such a crime.",anger
899,"The week before, Kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with Vronsky during a mazurka.",anger
900,This conversation had partly reassured the princess; but perfectly at ease she could not be.,joy
901,Vronsky had told Kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her.,anger
902,"“And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my mother’s arrival from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate,” he told her.",joy
903,Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words.,anger
904,But her mother saw them in a different light.,anger
905,"She knew that the old lady was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her son’s choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vexing his mother.",fear
906,"However, she was so anxious for the marriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she believed it was so.",fear
907,"Bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her husband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter’s fate engrossed all her feelings.",anger
908,"Today, with Levin’s reappearance, a fresh source of anxiety arose.",joy
909,"She was afraid that her daughter, who had at one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme sense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin’s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.",anger
910,"“Why, has he been here long?” the princess asked about Levin, as they returned home.",anger
911,"“He came today, mamma.” “There’s one thing I want to say....” began the princess, and from her serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.",anger
912,"“Mamma,” she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, “please, please don’t say anything about that.",anger
913,"I know, I know all about it.” She wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her mother’s wishes wounded her.",anger
914,"“I only want to say that to raise hopes....” “Mamma, darling, for goodness’ sake, don’t talk about it.",joy
915,"It’s so horrible to talk about it.” “I won’t,” said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter’s eyes; “but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from me.",anger
916,"You won’t?” “Never, mamma, none,” answered Kitty, flushing a little, and looking her mother straight in the face, “but there’s no use in my telling you anything, and I ...",anger
917,"I ... if I wanted to, I don’t know what to say or how....",anger
918,"I don’t know....” “No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,” thought the mother, smiling at her agitation and happiness.",joy
919,The princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important.,joy
920,"After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle.",joy
921,"Her heart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.",joy
922,"She felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first time, would be a turning point in her life.",joy
923,"And she was continually picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both together.",anger
924,"When she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with tenderness, on the memories of her relations with Levin.",love
925,The memories of childhood and of Levin’s friendship with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him.,joy
926,"His love for her, of which she felt certain, was flattering and delightful to her; and it was pleasant for her to think of Levin.",joy
927,"In her memories of Vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in the highest degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some false note—not in Vronsky, he was very simple and nice, but in herself, while with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear.",joy
928,"But, on the other hand, directly she thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future seemed misty.",joy
929,"When she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in complete possession of all her forces,—she needed this so for what lay before her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements.",joy
930,"At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing-room, when the footman announced, “Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.” The princess was still in her room, and the prince had not come in.",anger
931,"“So it is to be,” thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart.",anger
932,"She was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced into the looking-glass.",fear
933,At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer.,joy
934,"And only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new, different aspect; only then she realized that the question did not affect her only—with whom she would be happy, and whom she loved—but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked.",love
935,And to wound him cruelly.,anger
936,What for?,anger
937,"Because he, dear fellow, loved her, was in love with her.",love
938,"But there was no help for it, so it must be, so it would have to be.",anger
939,“My God!,anger
940,shall I myself really have to say it to him?” she thought.,anger
941,“Can I tell him I don’t love him?,anger
942,That will be a lie.,anger
943,What am I to say to him?,anger
944,That I love someone else?,anger
945,"No, that’s impossible.",sadness
946,"I’m going away, I’m going away.” She had reached the door, when she heard his step.",anger
947,“No!,anger
948,it’s not honest.,joy
949,What have I to be afraid of?,fear
950,I have done nothing wrong.,anger
951,"What is to be, will be!",anger
952,I’ll tell the truth.,anger
953,And with him one can’t be ill at ease.,anger
954,"Here he is,” she said to herself, seeing his powerful, shy figure, with his shining eyes fixed on her.",fear
955,"She looked straight into his face, as though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.",anger
956,"“It’s not time yet; I think I’m too early,” he said glancing round the empty drawing-room.",sadness
957,"When he saw that his expectations were realized, that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, his face became gloomy.",sadness
958,"“Oh, no,” said Kitty, and sat down at the table.",anger
959,"“But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,” he began, not sitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose courage.",anger
960,“Mamma will be down directly.,anger
961,She was very much tired....,sadness
962,"Yesterday....” She talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him.",anger
963,"He glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking.",anger
964,"“I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it depended on you....” She dropped her head lower and lower, not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming.",anger
965,"“That it depended on you,” he repeated.",anger
966,“I meant to say ...,anger
967,I meant to say ...,anger
968,"I came for this ... to be my wife!” he brought out, not knowing what he was saying; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said, he stopped short and looked at her.... She was breathing heavily, not looking at him.",sadness
969,She was feeling ecstasy.,joy
970,Her soul was flooded with happiness.,sadness
971,She had never anticipated that the utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her.,joy
972,But it lasted only an instant.,joy
973,She remembered Vronsky.,joy
974,"She lifted her clear, truthful eyes, and seeing his desperate face, she answered hastily: “That cannot be ... forgive me.” A moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance in his life!",anger
975,And how aloof and remote from him she had become now!,anger
976,"“It was bound to be so,” he said, not looking at her.",anger
977,"He bowed, and was meaning to retreat.",anger
978,But at that very moment the princess came in.,joy
979,"There was a look of horror on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces.",fear
980,"Levin bowed to her, and said nothing.",anger
981,Kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes.,joy
982,"“Thank God, she has refused him,” thought the mother, and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on Thursdays.",joy
983,She sat down and began questioning Levin about his life in the country.,anger
984,"He sat down again, waiting for other visitors to arrive, in order to retreat unnoticed.",sadness
985,"Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty’s, married the preceding winter, Countess Nordston.",anger
986,"She was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black eyes.",joy
987,"She was fond of Kitty, and her affection for her showed itself, as the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire to make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she wanted her to marry Vronsky.",love
988,"Levin she had often met at the Shtcherbatskys’ early in the winter, and she had always disliked him.",anger
989,"Her invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in making fun of him.",joy
990,"“I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur, or breaks off his learned conversation with me because I’m a fool, or is condescending to me.",anger
991,I like that so; to see him condescending!,anger
992,"I am so glad he can’t bear me,” she used to say of him.",anger
993,"She was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic—her nervousness, her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly.",love
994,"The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another not seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on friendly terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each other.",anger
995,The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.,anger
996,"“Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",anger
997,"So you’ve come back to our corrupt Babylon,” she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was a Babylon.",anger
998,"“Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?” she added, glancing with a simper at Kitty.",anger
999,"“It’s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words so well,” responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering his composure, and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the Countess Nordston.",anger
1000,"“They must certainly make a great impression on you.” “Oh, I should think so!",joy
1001,I always note them all down.,anger
1002,"Well, Kitty, have you been skating again?...” And she began talking to Kitty.",anger
1003,"Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw now, it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes.",sadness
1004,"He was on the point of getting up, when the princess, noticing that he was silent, addressed him.",anger
1005,“Shall you be long in Moscow?,anger
1006,"You’re busy with the district council, though, aren’t you, and can’t be away for long?” “No, princess, I’m no longer a member of the council,” he said.",anger
1007,"“I have come up for a few days.” “There’s something the matter with him,” thought Countess Nordston, glancing at his stern, serious face.",anger
1008,“He isn’t in his old argumentative mood.,anger
1009,But I’ll draw him out.,anger
1010,"I do love making a fool of him before Kitty, and I’ll do it.” “Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” she said to him, “do explain to me, please, what’s the meaning of it.",anger
1011,You know all about such things.,anger
1012,"At home in our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed, and now they can’t pay us any rent.",anger
1013,What’s the meaning of that?,anger
1014,"You always praise the peasants so.” At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.",anger
1015,"“Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can’t tell you anything,” he said, and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady.",anger
1016,"“That must be Vronsky,” thought Levin, and, to be sure of it, glanced at Kitty.",anger
1017,"She had already had time to look at Vronsky, and looked round at Levin.",anger
1018,"And simply from the look in her eyes, that grew unconsciously brighter, Levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as surely as if she had told him so in words.",joy
1019,But what sort of a man was he?,anger
1020,"Now, whether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but remain; he must find out what the man was like whom she loved.",anger
1021,"There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what, are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and to see only what is bad.",sadness
1022,"There are people, on the other hand, who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good.",joy
1023,Levin belonged to the second class.,anger
1024,But he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky.,joy
1025,It was apparent at the first glance.,joy
1026,"Vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very tall, with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute face.",joy
1027,"Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new uniform, was simple and at the same time elegant.",joy
1028,"Making way for the lady who had come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then to Kitty.",anger
1029,"As he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender light, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it seemed to Levin), bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held out his small broad hand to her.",joy
1030,"Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once glancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.",anger
1031,"“Let me introduce you,” said the princess, indicating Levin.",joy
1032,"“Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky.” Vronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands with him.",anger
1033,"“I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,” he said, smiling his simple and open smile; “but you had unexpectedly left for the country.” “Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople,” said Countess Nordston.",joy
1034,"“My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them so well,” said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he had said just the same thing before, he reddened.",joy
1035,"Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.",joy
1036,“Are you always in the country?” he inquired.,anger
1037,"“I should think it must be dull in the winter.” “It’s not dull if one has work to do; besides, one’s not dull by oneself,” Levin replied abruptly.",sadness
1038,"“I am fond of the country,” said Vronsky, noticing, and affecting not to notice, Levin’s tone.",love
1039,"“But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country always,” said Countess Nordston.",anger
1040,“I don’t know; I have never tried for long.,anger
1041,"I experienced a queer feeling once,” he went on.",sadness
1042,"“I never longed so for the country, Russian country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter with my mother in Nice.",joy
1043,"Nice itself is dull enough, you know.",joy
1044,"And indeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time.",joy
1045,"And it’s just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and especially the country.",fear
1046,"It’s as though....” He talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene, friendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what came into his head.",joy
1047,"Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he stopped short without finishing what he had begun, and listened attentively to her.",anger
1048,"The conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who always kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy guns—the relative advantages of classical and of modern education, and universal military service—had not to move out either of them, while Countess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.",joy
1049,"Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation; saying to himself every instant, “Now go,” he still did not go, as though waiting for something.",joy
1050,"The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess Nordston, who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the marvels she had seen.",anger
1051,"“Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity’s sake do take me to see them!",anger
1052,"I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I am always on the lookout for it everywhere,” said Vronsky, smiling.",joy
1053,"“Very well, next Saturday,” answered Countess Nordston.",joy
1054,"“But you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?” she asked Levin.",anger
1055,“Why do you ask me?,anger
1056,"You know what I shall say.” “But I want to hear your opinion.” “My opinion,” answered Levin, “is only that this table-turning simply proves that educated society—so called—is no higher than the peasants.",joy
1057,"They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while we....” “Oh, then you don’t believe in it?” “I can’t believe in it, countess.” “But if I’ve seen it myself?” “The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.” “Then you think I tell a lie?” And she laughed a mirthless laugh.",anger
1058,"“Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in it,” said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and, still more exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was threatening to become disagreeable.",anger
1059,“You do not admit the conceivability at all?” he queried.,anger
1060,“But why not?,anger
1061,"We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing.",joy
1062,"Why should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which....” “When electricity was discovered,” Levin interrupted hurriedly, “it was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its applications were conceived.",anger
1063,"But the spiritualists have begun with tables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force.” Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen, obviously interested in his words.",anger
1064,"“Yes, but the spiritualists say we don’t know at present what this force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which it acts.",anger
1065,Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.,anger
1066,"No, I don’t see why there should not be a new force, if it....” “Why, because with electricity,” Levin interrupted again, “every time you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon.” Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing-room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to change the conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.",sadness
1067,"“Do let us try at once, countess,” he said; but Levin would finish saying what he thought.",anger
1068,"“I think,” he went on, “that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.",sadness
1069,"They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to material experiment.” Everyone was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.",sadness
1070,"“And I think you would be a first-rate medium,” said Countess Nordston; “there’s something enthusiastic in you.” Levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said nothing.",joy
1071,"“Do let us try table-turning at once, please,” said Vronsky.",anger
1072,"“Princess, will you allow it?” And Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.",anger
1073,"Kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met Levin’s.",anger
1074,"She felt for him with her whole heart, the more because she was pitying him for suffering of which she was herself the cause.",sadness
1075,"“If you can forgive me, forgive me,” said her eyes, “I am so happy.” “I hate them all, and you, and myself,” his eyes responded, and he took up his hat.",joy
1076,But he was not destined to escape.,joy
1077,"Just as they were arranging themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of retiring, the old prince came in, and after greeting the ladies, addressed Levin.",anger
1078,“Ah!” he began joyously.,anger
1079,"“Been here long, my boy?",anger
1080,I didn’t even know you were in town.,anger
1081,"Very glad to see you.” The old prince embraced Levin, and talking to him did not observe Vronsky, who had risen, and was serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him.",anger
1082,Kitty felt how distasteful her father’s warmth was to Levin after what had happened.,sadness
1083,"She saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last to Vronsky’s bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.",anger
1084,"“Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said Countess Nordston; “we want to try an experiment.” “What experiment?",anger
1085,Table-turning?,anger
1086,"Well, you must excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game,” said the old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that it had been his suggestion.",joy
1087,"“There’s some sense in that, anyway.” Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and, with a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of the great ball that was to come off next week.",joy
1088,“I hope you will be there?” he said to Kitty.,joy
1089,"As soon as the old prince turned away from him, Levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling, happy face of Kitty answering Vronsky’s inquiry about the ball.",joy
1090,"At the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation with Levin, and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin, she was glad at the thought that she had received an _offer_.",joy
1091,She had no doubt that she had acted rightly.,anger
1092,"But after she had gone to bed, for a long while she could not sleep.",anger
1093,One impression pursued her relentlessly.,anger
1094,"It was Levin’s face, with his scowling brows, and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them, as he stood listening to her father, and glancing at her and at Vronsky.",anger
1095,And she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes.,sadness
1096,But immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up.,anger
1097,"She vividly recalled his manly, resolute face, his noble self-possession, and the good nature conspicuous in everything towards everyone.",joy
1098,"She remembered the love for her of the man she loved, and once more all was gladness in her soul, and she lay on the pillow, smiling with happiness.",joy
1099,"“I’m sorry, I’m sorry; but what could I do?",anger
1100,"It’s not my fault,” she said to herself; but an inner voice told her something else.",anger
1101,"Whether she felt remorse at having won Levin’s love, or at having refused him, she did not know.",anger
1102,But her happiness was poisoned by doubts.,anger
1103,"“Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us!” she repeated to herself, till she fell asleep.",sadness
1104,"Meanwhile there took place below, in the prince’s little library, one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter.",joy
1105,“What?,anger
1106,"I’ll tell you what!” shouted the prince, waving his arms, and at once wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again.",anger
1107,"“That you’ve no pride, no dignity; that you’re disgracing, ruining your daughter by this vulgar, stupid matchmaking!” “But, really, for mercy’s sake, prince, what have I done?” said the princess, almost crying.",sadness
1108,"She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had gone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no intention of telling him of Levin’s offer and Kitty’s refusal, still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived.",joy
1109,"And thereupon, at those words, the prince had all at once flown into a passion, and began to use unseemly language.",anger
1110,“What have you done?,joy
1111,I’ll tell you what.,anger
1112,"First of all, you’re trying to catch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it, and with good reason.",joy
1113,"If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don’t pick out the possible suitors.",joy
1114,Invite all the young bucks.,joy
1115,"Engage a piano player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays, hunting up good matches.",joy
1116,"It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you’ve gone on till you’ve turned the poor wench’s head.",anger
1117,Levin’s a thousand times the better man.,anger
1118,"As for this little Petersburg swell, they’re turned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.",anger
1119,"But if he were a prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after anyone.” “But what have I done?” “Why, you’ve....” The prince was crying wrathfully.",anger
1120,"“I know if one were to listen to you,” interrupted the princess, “we should never marry our daughter.",anger
1121,"If it’s to be so, we’d better go into the country.” “Well, and we had better.” “But do wait a minute.",joy
1122,Do I try and catch them?,anger
1123,I don’t try to catch them in the least.,anger
1124,"A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love with her, and she, I fancy....” “Oh, yes, you fancy!",joy
1125,"And how if she really is in love, and he’s no more thinking of marriage than I am!...",joy
1126,"Oh, that I should live to see it!",anger
1127,Ah!,joy
1128,spiritualism!,anger
1129,Ah!,joy
1130,Nice!,joy
1131,Ah!,joy
1132,"the ball!” And the prince, imagining that he was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word.",anger
1133,“And this is how we’re preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she’s really got the notion into her head....” “But what makes you suppose so?” “I don’t suppose; I know.,anger
1134,"We have eyes for such things, though women-folk haven’t.",joy
1135,"I see a man who has serious intentions, that’s Levin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head, who’s only amusing himself.” “Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...” “Well, you’ll remember my words, but too late, just as with Dolly.” “Well, well, we won’t talk of it,” the princess stopped him, recollecting her unlucky Dolly.",anger
1136,"“By all means, and good-night!” And signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with a kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.",joy
1137,"The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled Kitty’s future, and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky’s intentions, but her husband’s words had disturbed her.",sadness
1138,"And returning to her own room, in terror before the unknown future, she, too, like Kitty, repeated several times in her heart, “Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity.” Vronsky had never had a real home life.",sadness
1139,"His mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life, and still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world.",joy
1140,"His father he scarcely remembered, and he had been educated in the Corps of Pages.",joy
1141,"Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once got into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men.",joy
1142,"Although he did go more or less into Petersburg society, his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it.",anger
1143,"In Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and coarse life at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank, who cared for him.",joy
1144,It never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty.,anger
1145,At balls he danced principally with her.,anger
1146,He was a constant visitor at their house.,anger
1147,"He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society—all sorts of nonsense, but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case.",anger
1148,"Although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he liked it, and the tenderer was his feeling for her.",sadness
1149,"He did not know that his mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite character, that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage, and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was.",joy
1150,"It seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure, and he was enjoying his discovery.",joy
1151,"If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been greatly astonished, and would not have believed it.",sadness
1152,"He could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him, and above all to her, could be wrong.",anger
1153,Still less could he have believed that he ought to marry.,anger
1154,Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility.,joy
1155,"He not only disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was, in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived, conceived as something alien, repellant, and, above all, ridiculous.",anger
1156,"But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were saying, he felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys’ that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken.",joy
1157,But what step could and ought to be taken he could not imagine.,anger
1158,"“What is so exquisite,” he thought, as he returned from the Shtcherbatskys’, carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he had not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him—“what is so exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her, but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly than ever she told me she loves me.",love
1159,"And how secretly, simply, and most of all, how trustfully!",anger
1160,"I feel myself better, purer.",joy
1161,"I feel that I have a heart, and that there is a great deal of good in me.",joy
1162,"Those sweet, loving eyes!",love
1163,"When she said: ‘Indeed I do....’ “Well, what then?",anger
1164,"Oh, nothing.",joy
1165,"It’s good for me, and good for her.” And he began wondering where to finish the evening.",joy
1166,He passed in review of the places he might go to.,anger
1167,“Club?,anger
1168,"a game of bezique, champagne with Ignatov?",anger
1169,"No, I’m not going.",joy
1170,"_Château des Fleurs_; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan.",anger
1171,"No, I’m sick of it.",anger
1172,"That’s why I like the Shtcherbatskys’, that I’m growing better.",joy
1173,"I’ll go home.” He went straight to his room at Dussots’ Hotel, ordered supper, and then undressed, and as soon as his head touched the pillow, fell into a sound sleep.",sadness
1174,"Next day at eleven o’clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station of the Petersburg railway to meet his mother, and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky, who was expecting his sister by the same train.",anger
1175,“Ah!,anger
1176,"your excellency!” cried Oblonsky, “whom are you meeting?” “My mother,” Vronsky responded, smiling, as everyone did who met Oblonsky.",anger
1177,"He shook hands with him, and together they ascended the steps.",anger
1178,“She is to be here from Petersburg today.” “I was looking out for you till two o’clock last night.,anger
1179,"Where did you go after the Shtcherbatskys’?” “Home,” answered Vronsky.",anger
1180,"“I must own I felt so well content yesterday after the Shtcherbatskys’ that I didn’t care to go anywhere.” “I know a gallant steed by tokens sure, And by his eyes I know a youth in love,” declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch, just as he had done before to Levin.",joy
1181,"Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it, but he promptly changed the subject.",anger
1182,“And whom are you meeting?” he asked.,anger
1183,“I?,anger
1184,"I’ve come to meet a pretty woman,” said Oblonsky.",anger
1185,“You don’t say so!” “_Honi soit qui mal y pense!_ My sister Anna.” “Ah!,anger
1186,"that’s Madame Karenina,” said Vronsky.",anger
1187,"“You know her, no doubt?” “I think I do.",joy
1188,Or perhaps not ...,joy
1189,"I really am not sure,” Vronsky answered heedlessly, with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name Karenina.",sadness
1190,"“But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you surely must know.",joy
1191,All the world knows him.” “I know him by reputation and by sight.,joy
1192,"I know that he’s clever, learned, religious somewhat....",joy
1193,"But you know that’s not ... _not in my line,_” said Vronsky in English.",anger
1194,"“Yes, he’s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a splendid man,” observed Stepan Arkadyevitch, “a splendid man.” “Oh, well, so much the better for him,” said Vronsky smiling.",joy
1195,"“Oh, you’ve come,” he said, addressing a tall old footman of his mother’s, standing at the door; “come here.” Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone, Vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with Kitty.",joy
1196,"“Well, what do you say?",anger
1197,"Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the _diva?_” he said to him with a smile, taking his arm.",anger
1198,“Of course.,joy
1199,I’m collecting subscriptions.,anger
1200,"Oh, did you make the acquaintance of my friend Levin?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1201,"“Yes; but he left rather early.” “He’s a capital fellow,” pursued Oblonsky.",anger
1202,"“Isn’t he?” “I don’t know why it is,” responded Vronsky, “in all Moscow people—present company of course excepted,” he put in jestingly, “there’s something uncompromising.",anger
1203,"They are all on the defensive, lose their tempers, as though they all want to make one feel something....” “Yes, that’s true, it is so,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing good-humoredly.",joy
1204,“Will the train soon be in?” Vronsky asked a railway official.,anger
1205,"“The train’s signaled,” answered the man.",anger
1206,"The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen and attendants, and people meeting the train.",anger
1207,Through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line.,anger
1208,"The hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.",sadness
1209,"“No,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell Vronsky of Levin’s intentions in regard to Kitty.",joy
1210,"“No, you’ve not got a true impression of Levin.",joy
1211,"He’s a very nervous man, and is sometimes out of humor, it’s true, but then he is often very nice.",joy
1212,"He’s such a true, honest nature, and a heart of gold.",joy
1213,"But yesterday there were special reasons,” pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky.",joy
1214,"“Yes, there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy.” Vronsky stood still and asked directly: “How so?",sadness
1215,"Do you mean he made your _belle-sœur_ an offer yesterday?” “Maybe,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
1216,“I fancied something of the sort yesterday.,anger
1217,"Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, it must mean it.... He’s been so long in love, and I’m very sorry for him.” “So that’s it!",anger
1218,"I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a better match,” said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking about again, “though I don’t know him, of course,” he added.",anger
1219,"“Yes, that is a hateful position!",anger
1220,That’s why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras.,anger
1221,"If you don’t succeed with them it only proves that you’ve not enough cash, but in this case one’s dignity’s at stake.",joy
1222,But here’s the train.” The engine had already whistled in the distance.,anger
1223,"A few instants later the platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the engine-driver covered with frost.",anger
1224,"Behind the tender, setting the platform more and more slowly swaying, came the luggage van with a dog whining in it.",anger
1225,"At last the passenger carriages rolled in, oscillating before coming to a standstill.",anger
1226,"A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards, holding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little merchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his shoulder.",anger
1227,"Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the passengers, totally oblivious of his mother.",anger
1228,What he had just heard about Kitty excited and delighted him.,joy
1229,"Unconsciously he arched his chest, and his eyes flashed.",joy
1230,He felt himself a conqueror.,joy
1231,"“Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,” said the smart guard, going up to Vronsky.",joy
1232,"The guard’s words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her.",anger
1233,"He did not in his heart respect his mother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her, though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and with his own education, he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient, and the more externally obedient and respectful his behavior, the less in his heart he respected and loved her.",joy
1234,"Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out.",anger
1235,"With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady’s appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society.",joy
1236,"He begged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must glance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful, not on account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as she passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and soft.",joy
1237,"As he looked round, she too turned her head.",anger
1238,"Her shining gray eyes, that looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly attention on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone.",anger
1239,"In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips.",joy
1240,"It was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes, and now in her smile.",joy
1241,"Deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes, but it shone against her will in the faintly perceptible smile.",joy
1242,Vronsky stepped into the carriage.,anger
1243,"His mother, a dried-up old lady with black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and smiled slightly with her thin lips.",anger
1244,"Getting up from the seat and handing her maid a bag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss, and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek.",love
1245,“You got my telegram?,anger
1246,Quite well?,joy
1247,"Thank God.” “You had a good journey?” said her son, sitting down beside her, and involuntarily listening to a woman’s voice outside the door.",anger
1248,He knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door.,anger
1249,"“All the same I don’t agree with you,” said the lady’s voice.",anger
1250,"“It’s the Petersburg view, madame.” “Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,” she responded.",anger
1251,"“Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.” “Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch.",joy
1252,"And could you see if my brother is here, and send him to me?” said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back again into the compartment.",anger
1253,"“Well, have you found your brother?” said Countess Vronskaya, addressing the lady.",anger
1254,Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.,anger
1255,"“Your brother is here,” he said, standing up.",anger
1256,"“Excuse me, I did not know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,” said Vronsky, bowing, “that no doubt you do not remember me.” “Oh, no,” said she, “I should have known you because your mother and I have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.” As she spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile.",joy
1257,"“And still no sign of my brother.” “Do call him, Alexey,” said the old countess.",anger
1258,Vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted: “Oblonsky!,anger
1259,"Here!” Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light, resolute step.",anger
1260,"And as soon as her brother had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by its decision and its grace, she flung her left arm around his neck, drew him rapidly to her, and kissed him warmly.",joy
1261,"Vronsky gazed, never taking his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why.",anger
1262,"But recollecting that his mother was waiting for him, he went back again into the carriage.",anger
1263,"“She’s very sweet, isn’t she?” said the countess of Madame Karenina.",joy
1264,"“Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her.",joy
1265,We’ve been talking all the way.,anger
1266,"And so you, I hear ... _vous filez le parfait amour.",anger
1267,"Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux._” “I don’t know what you are referring to, maman,” he answered coldly.",anger
1268,"“Come, maman, let us go.” Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the countess.",joy
1269,"“Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,” she said.",anger
1270,“And all my gossip is exhausted.,sadness
1271,"I should have nothing more to tell you.” “Oh, no,” said the countess, taking her hand.",anger
1272,“I could go all around the world with you and never be dull.,sadness
1273,You are one of those delightful women in whose company it’s sweet to be silent as well as to talk.,joy
1274,"Now please don’t fret over your son; you can’t expect never to be parted.” Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her eyes were smiling.",joy
1275,"“Anna Arkadyevna,” the countess said in explanation to her son, “has a little son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been parted from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.” “Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son and she of hers,” said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up her face, a caressing smile intended for him.",joy
1276,"“I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,” he said, promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him.",anger
1277,"But apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain, and she turned to the old countess.",anger
1278,“Thank you so much.,joy
1279,The time has passed so quickly.,anger
1280,"Good-bye, countess.” “Good-bye, my love,” answered the countess.",joy
1281,“Let me have a kiss of your pretty face.,joy
1282,"I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that I’ve lost my heart to you.” Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it.",joy
1283,"She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her cheek to the countess’s lips, drew herself up again, and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to Vronsky.",anger
1284,"He pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as though at something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand.",joy
1285,She went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully-developed figure with such strange lightness.,fear
1286,"“Very charming,” said the countess.",joy
1287,That was just what her son was thinking.,anger
1288,"His eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his face.",joy
1289,"He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her arm in his, and began telling him something eagerly, obviously something that had nothing to do with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt annoyed.",anger
1290,"“Well, maman, are you perfectly well?” he repeated, turning to his mother.",joy
1291,“Everything has been delightful.,joy
1292,"Alexander has been very good, and Marie has grown very pretty.",joy
1293,"She’s very interesting.” And she began telling him again of what interested her most—the christening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in Petersburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar.",anger
1294,"“Here’s Lavrenty,” said Vronsky, looking out of the window; “now we can go, if you like.” The old butler, who had traveled with the countess, came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up to go.",anger
1295,"“Come; there’s not such a crowd now,” said Vronsky.",joy
1296,"The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the other baggage.",anger
1297,Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panic-stricken faces.,fear
1298,"The station-master, too, ran by in his extraordinary colored cap.",joy
1299,Obviously something unusual had happened.,fear
1300,The crowd who had left the train were running back again.,anger
1301,“What?...,anger
1302,What?...,anger
1303,Where?...,anger
1304,Flung himself!...,anger
1305,Crushed!...” was heard among the crowd.,anger
1306,"Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his sister on his arm, turned back.",anger
1307,"They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd.",fear
1308,"The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster.",anger
1309,"A guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.",anger
1310,Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler.,anger
1311,Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse.,anger
1312,Oblonsky was evidently upset.,anger
1313,He frowned and seemed ready to cry.,anger
1314,"“Ah, how awful!",sadness
1315,"Ah, Anna, if you had seen it!",anger
1316,"Ah, how awful!” he said.",anger
1317,"Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly composed.",joy
1318,"“Oh, if you had seen it, countess,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1319,“And his wife was there....,anger
1320,It was awful to see her!...,anger
1321,She flung herself on the body.,anger
1322,They say he was the only support of an immense family.,anger
1323,How awful!” “Couldn’t one do anything for her?” said Madame Karenina in an agitated whisper.,fear
1324,"Vronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.",anger
1325,"“I’ll be back directly, maman,” he remarked, turning round in the doorway.",anger
1326,"When he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevitch was already in conversation with the countess about the new singer, while the countess was impatiently looking towards the door, waiting for her son.",anger
1327,"“Now let us be off,” said Vronsky, coming in.",anger
1328,They went out together.,anger
1329,Vronsky was in front with his mother.,anger
1330,Behind walked Madame Karenina with her brother.,anger
1331,Just as they were going out of the station the station-master overtook Vronsky.,anger
1332,“You gave my assistant two hundred roubles.,anger
1333,"Would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them?” “For the widow,” said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders.",anger
1334,"“I should have thought there was no need to ask.” “You gave that?” cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his sister’s hand, he added: “Very nice, very nice!",joy
1335,Isn’t he a splendid fellow?,joy
1336,"Good-bye, countess.” And he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid.",anger
1337,When they went out the Vronsky’s carriage had already driven away.,anger
1338,People coming in were still talking of what happened.,anger
1339,"“What a horrible death!” said a gentleman, passing by.",anger
1340,"“They say he was cut in two pieces.” “On the contrary, I think it’s the easiest—instantaneous,” observed another.",anger
1341,“How is it they don’t take proper precautions?” said a third.,anger
1342,"Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with difficulty restraining her tears.",fear
1343,"“What is it, Anna?” he asked, when they had driven a few hundred yards.",anger
1344,"“It’s an omen of evil,” she said.",anger
1345,“What nonsense!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
1346,"“You’ve come, that’s the chief thing.",anger
1347,You can’t conceive how I’m resting my hopes on you.” “Have you known Vronsky long?” she asked.,anger
1348,“Yes.,anger
1349,You know we’re hoping he will marry Kitty.” “Yes?” said Anna softly.,anger
1350,"“Come now, let us talk of you,” she added, tossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her.",sadness
1351,“Let us talk of your affairs.,anger
1352,"I got your letter, and here I am.” “Yes, all my hopes are in you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
1353,"“Well, tell me all about it.” And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.",anger
1354,"On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her hand, and set off to his office.",anger
1355,"When Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little drawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his father, giving him a lesson in French reading.",sadness
1356,"As the boy read, he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket.",anger
1357,"His mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the fat little hand went back to the button again.",anger
1358,His mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket.,anger
1359,"“Keep your hands still, Grisha,” she said, and she took up her work, a coverlet she had long been making.",anger
1360,"She always set to work on it at depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her fingers and counting the stitches.",fear
1361,"Though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was expecting her sister-in-law with emotion.",sadness
1362,"Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it.",sadness
1363,"Still she did not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the most important personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg _grande dame_.",anger
1364,"And, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry out her threat to her husband—that is to say, she remembered that her sister-in-law was coming.",anger
1365,"“And, after all, Anna is in no wise to blame,” thought Dolly.",joy
1366,"“I know nothing of her except the very best, and I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards myself.” It was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at Petersburg at the Karenins’, she did not like their household itself; there was something artificial in the whole framework of their family life.",joy
1367,“But why should I not receive her?,anger
1368,If only she doesn’t take it into her head to console me!” thought Dolly.,anger
1369,"“All consolation and counsel and Christian forgiveness, all that I have thought over a thousand times, and it’s all no use.” All these days Dolly had been alone with her children.",sadness
1370,"She did not want to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters.",joy
1371,"She knew that in one way or another she would tell Anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases of good advice and comfort.",anger
1372,"She had been on the lookout for her, glancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip just that minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the bell.",joy
1373,"Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked round, and her care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but wonder.",joy
1374,She got up and embraced her sister-in-law.,anger
1375,"“What, here already!” she said as she kissed her.",anger
1376,"“Dolly, how glad I am to see you!” “I am glad, too,” said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the expression of Anna’s face to find out whether she knew.",joy
1377,"“Most likely she knows,” she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna’s face.",sadness
1378,"“Well, come along, I’ll take you to your room,” she went on, trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences.",anger
1379,“Is this Grisha?,joy
1380,"Heavens, how he’s grown!” said Anna; and kissing him, never taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed a little.",anger
1381,"“No, please, let us stay here.” She took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her hair down.",anger
1382,"“You are radiant with health and happiness!” said Dolly, almost with envy.",joy
1383,“I?...,anger
1384,"Yes,” said Anna.",anger
1385,"“Merciful heavens, Tanya!",joy
1386,"You’re the same age as my Seryozha,” she added, addressing the little girl as she ran in.",anger
1387,She took her in her arms and kissed her.,anger
1388,"“Delightful child, delightful!",joy
1389,"Show me them all.” She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years, months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not but appreciate that.",joy
1390,"“Very well, we will go to them,” she said.",joy
1391,"“It’s a pity Vassya’s asleep.” After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the drawing-room, to coffee.",anger
1392,"Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away from her.",anger
1393,"“Dolly,” she said, “he has told me.” Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of conventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.",anger
1394,"“Dolly, dear,” she said, “I don’t want to speak for him to you, nor to try to comfort you; that’s impossible.",sadness
1395,"But, darling, I’m simply sorry, sorry from my heart for you!” Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered.",sadness
1396,She moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous little hand.,joy
1397,"Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its frigid expression.",joy
1398,She said: “To comfort me’s impossible.,sadness
1399,"Everything’s lost after what has happened, everything’s over!” And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened.",fear
1400,"Anna lifted the wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said: “But, Dolly, what’s to be done, what’s to be done?",anger
1401,"How is it best to act in this awful position—that’s what you must think of.” “All’s over, and there’s nothing more,” said Dolly.",joy
1402,"“And the worst of all is, you see, that I can’t cast him off: there are the children, I am tied.",anger
1403,And I can’t live with him!,anger
1404,"it’s a torture to me to see him.” “Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you: tell me about it.” Dolly looked at her inquiringly.",anger
1405,Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna’s face.,joy
1406,"“Very well,” she said all at once.",joy
1407,“But I will tell you it from the beginning.,anger
1408,You know how I was married.,anger
1409,"With the education mamma gave us I was more than innocent, I was stupid.",joy
1410,I knew nothing.,joy
1411,"I know they say men tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva”—she corrected herself—“Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing.",anger
1412,"You’ll hardly believe it, but till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known.",anger
1413,So I lived eight years.,anger
1414,"You must understand that I was so far from suspecting infidelity, I regarded it as impossible, and then—try to imagine it—with such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all the loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me.",anger
1415,"To be fully convinced of one’s happiness, and all at once....” continued Dolly, holding back her sobs, “to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress, my governess.",anger
1416,"No, it’s too awful!” She hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it.",anger
1417,"“I can understand being carried away by feeling,” she went on after a brief silence, “but deliberately, slyly deceiving me ... and with whom?...",sadness
1418,To go on being my husband together with her ... it’s awful!,sadness
1419,"You can’t understand....” “Oh, yes, I understand!",anger
1420,I understand!,anger
1421,"Dolly, dearest, I do understand,” said Anna, pressing her hand.",anger
1422,“And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?” Dolly resumed.,joy
1423,“Not the slightest!,anger
1424,"He’s happy and contented.” “Oh, no!” Anna interposed quickly.",joy
1425,"“He’s to be pitied, he’s weighed down by remorse....” “Is he capable of remorse?” Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her sister-in-law’s face.",joy
1426,“Yes.,anger
1427,I know him.,anger
1428,I could not look at him without feeling sorry for him.,sadness
1429,We both know him.,anger
1430,"He’s good-hearted, but he’s proud, and now he’s so humiliated.",sadness
1431,"What touched me most....” (and here Anna guessed what would touch Dolly most) “he’s tortured by two things: that he’s ashamed for the children’s sake, and that, loving you—yes, yes, loving you beyond everything on earth,” she hurriedly interrupted Dolly, who would have answered—“he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart.",anger
1432,"‘No, no, she cannot forgive me,’ he keeps saying.” Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to her words.",anger
1433,"“Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it’s worse for the guilty than the innocent,” she said, “if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault.",joy
1434,"But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his wife again after her?",anger
1435,"For me to live with him now would be torture, just because I love my past love for him....” And sobs cut short her words.",sadness
1436,"But as though of set design, each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.",anger
1437,"“She’s young, you see, she’s pretty,” she went on.",joy
1438,"“Do you know, Anna, my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom?",anger
1439,By him and his children.,anger
1440,"I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service, and now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him.",anger
1441,"No doubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent.",fear
1442,Do you understand?” Again her eyes glowed with hatred.,anger
1443,“And after that he will tell me.... What!,anger
1444,can I believe him?,anger
1445,Never!,anger
1446,"No, everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of my work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching Grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture.",sadness
1447,What have I to strive and toil for?,anger
1448,Why are the children here?,joy
1449,"What’s so awful is that all at once my heart’s turned, and instead of love and tenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred.",anger
1450,"I could kill him.” “Darling Dolly, I understand, but don’t torture yourself.",anger
1451,"You are so distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.” Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.",fear
1452,“What’s to be done?,anger
1453,"Think for me, Anna, help me.",anger
1454,"I have thought over everything, and I see nothing.” Anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each word, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.",anger
1455,"“One thing I would say,” began Anna.",anger
1456,"“I am his sister, I know his character, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything” (she waved her hand before her forehead), “that faculty for being completely carried away, but for completely repenting too.",anger
1457,"He cannot believe it, he cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did.” “No; he understands, he understood!” Dolly broke in.",anger
1458,“But I ... you are forgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?” “Wait a minute.,joy
1459,"When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the awfulness of your position.",anger
1460,"I saw nothing but him, and that the family was broken up.",anger
1461,"I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see it, as a woman, quite differently.",sadness
1462,"I see your agony, and I can’t tell you how sorry I am for you!",anger
1463,"But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your sufferings, only there is one thing I don’t know; I don’t know ...",joy
1464,I don’t know how much love there is still in your heart for him.,anger
1465,That you know—whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him.,anger
1466,"If there is, forgive him!” “No,” Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her hand once more.",anger
1467,"“I know more of the world than you do,” she said.",anger
1468,“I know how men like Stiva look at it.,anger
1469,You speak of his talking of you with her.,anger
1470,That never happened.,anger
1471,"Such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred to them.",anger
1472,"Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family.",joy
1473,They draw a sort of line that can’t be crossed between them and their families.,anger
1474,"I don’t understand it, but it is so.” “Yes, but he has kissed her....” “Dolly, hush, darling.",anger
1475,I saw Stiva when he was in love with you.,anger
1476,"I remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes.",joy
1477,"You know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word: ‘Dolly’s a marvelous woman.’ You have always been a divinity for him, and you are that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the heart....” “But if it is repeated?” “It cannot be, as I understand it....” “Yes, but could you forgive it?” “I don’t know, I can’t judge....",sadness
1478,"Yes, I can,” said Anna, thinking a moment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance, she added: “Yes, I can, I can, I can.",anger
1479,"Yes, I could forgive it.",anger
1480,"I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive it, and forgive it as though it had never been, never been at all....” “Oh, of course,” Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what she had more than once thought, “else it would not be forgiveness.",sadness
1481,"If one forgives, it must be completely, completely.",joy
1482,"Come, let us go; I’ll take you to your room,” she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced Anna.",anger
1483,"“My dear, how glad I am you came.",joy
1484,"It has made things better, ever so much better.” The whole of that day Anna spent at home, that’s to say at the Oblonskys’, and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day.",joy
1485,Anna spent the whole morning with Dolly and the children.,anger
1486,She merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.,anger
1487,"“Come, God is merciful,” she wrote.",anger
1488,"Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife, speaking to him, addressed him as “Stiva,” as she had not done before.",anger
1489,"In the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still remained, but there was no talk now of separation, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.",sadness
1490,Immediately after dinner Kitty came in.,anger
1491,"She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but only very slightly, and she came now to her sister’s with some trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg lady, whom everyone spoke so highly of.",joy
1492,But she made a favorable impression on Anna Arkadyevna—she saw that at once.,joy
1493,"Anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before Kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under Anna’s sway, but in love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married women.",sadness
1494,"Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of eight years old.",joy
1495,"In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her eyes, which struck and attracted Kitty.",anger
1496,"Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.",joy
1497,"After dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.",anger
1498,"“Stiva,” she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing towards the door, “go, and God help you.” He threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the doorway.",anger
1499,"When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children.",anger
1500,"Either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they felt a special charm in her themselves, the two elder ones, and the younger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about their new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her side.",sadness
1501,"And it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her ring, or even touch the flounce of her skirt.",love
1502,"“Come, come, as we were sitting before,” said Anna Arkadyevna, sitting down in her place.",anger
1503,"And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with his head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.",joy
1504,“And when is your next ball?” she asked Kitty.,anger
1505,"“Next week, and a splendid ball.",joy
1506,"One of those balls where one always enjoys oneself.” “Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?” Anna said, with tender irony.",love
1507,"“It’s strange, but there are.",fear
1508,"At the Bobrishtchevs’ one always enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitins’ too, while at the Mezhkovs’ it’s always dull.",sadness
1509,"Haven’t you noticed it?” “No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself,” said Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which was not open to her.",fear
1510,“For me there are some less dull and tiresome.” “How can _you_ be dull at a ball?” “Why should not _I_ be dull at a ball?” inquired Anna.,sadness
1511,Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.,anger
1512,“Because you always look nicer than anyone.” Anna had the faculty of blushing.,anger
1513,"She blushed a little, and said: “In the first place it’s never so; and secondly, if it were, what difference would it make to me?” “Are you coming to this ball?” asked Kitty.",anger
1514,“I imagine it won’t be possible to avoid going.,joy
1515,"Here, take it,” she said to Tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring off her white, slender-tipped finger.",anger
1516,“I shall be so glad if you go.,joy
1517,"I should so like to see you at a ball.” “Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that it’s a pleasure to you ... Grisha, don’t pull my hair.",joy
1518,"It’s untidy enough without that,” she said, putting up a straying lock, which Grisha had been playing with.",anger
1519,"“I imagine you at the ball in lilac.” “And why in lilac precisely?” asked Anna, smiling.",joy
1520,"“Now, children, run along, run along.",anger
1521,Do you hear?,joy
1522,"Miss Hoole is calling you to tea,” she said, tearing the children from her, and sending them off to the dining-room.",anger
1523,“I know why you press me to come to the ball.,anger
1524,"You expect a great deal of this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in it.” “How do you know?",joy
1525,Yes.” “Oh!,anger
1526,"what a happy time you are at,” pursued Anna.",joy
1527,"“I remember, and I know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland.",joy
1528,"That mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a path growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not been through it?” Kitty smiled without speaking.",joy
1529,“But how did she go through it?,anger
1530,"How I should like to know all her love story!” thought Kitty, recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her husband.",anger
1531,“I know something.,joy
1532,"Stiva told me, and I congratulate you.",anger
1533,"I liked him so much,” Anna continued.",anger
1534,"“I met Vronsky at the railway station.” “Oh, was he there?” asked Kitty, blushing.",anger
1535,“What was it Stiva told you?” “Stiva gossiped about it all.,anger
1536,And I should be so glad ...,joy
1537,"I traveled yesterday with Vronsky’s mother,” she went on; “and his mother talked without a pause of him, he’s her favorite.",anger
1538,"I know mothers are partial, but....” “What did his mother tell you?” “Oh, a great deal!",joy
1539,"And I know that he’s her favorite; still one can see how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of the water.",anger
1540,"He’s a hero, in fact,” said Anna, smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.",anger
1541,But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles.,anger
1542,For some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it.,anger
1543,"She felt that there was something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought not to have been.",sadness
1544,"“She pressed me very much to go and see her,” Anna went on; “and I shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow.",anger
1545,"Stiva is staying a long while in Dolly’s room, thank God,” Anna added, changing the subject, and getting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something.",anger
1546,"“No, I’m first!",joy
1547,"No, I!” screamed the children, who had finished tea, running up to their Aunt Anna.",anger
1548,"“All together,” said Anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, and embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking with delight.",joy
1549,Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people.,anger
1550,Stepan Arkadyevitch did not come out.,anger
1551,He must have left his wife’s room by the other door.,anger
1552,"“I am afraid you’ll be cold upstairs,” observed Dolly, addressing Anna; “I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer.” “Oh, please, don’t trouble about me,” answered Anna, looking intently into Dolly’s face, trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not.",anger
1553,"“It will be lighter for you here,” answered her sister-in-law.",anger
1554,"“I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot.” “What’s the question?” inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out of his room and addressing his wife.",anger
1555,From his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken place.,anger
1556,"“I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds.",anger
1557,"No one knows how to do it; I must see to it myself,” answered Dolly addressing him.",anger
1558,"“God knows whether they are fully reconciled,” thought Anna, hearing her tone, cold and composed.",anger
1559,"“Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,” answered her husband.",anger
1560,"“Come, I’ll do it all, if you like....” “Yes, they must be reconciled,” thought Anna.",anger
1561,"“I know how you do everything,” answered Dolly.",joy
1562,"“You tell Matvey to do what can’t be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to make a muddle of everything,” and her habitual, mocking smile curved the corners of Dolly’s lips as she spoke.",joy
1563,"“Full, full reconciliation, full,” thought Anna; “thank God!” and rejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dolly and kissed her.",anger
1564,“Not at all.,anger
1565,"Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife.",anger
1566,"The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to her husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not so as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his offense.",joy
1567,At half-past nine o’clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys’ was broken up by an apparently simple incident.,joy
1568,But this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange.,fear
1569,"Talking about common acquaintances in Petersburg, Anna got up quickly.",anger
1570,"“She is in my album,” she said; “and, by the way, I’ll show you my Seryozha,” she added, with a mother’s smile of pride.",joy
1571,"Towards ten o’clock, when she usually said good-night to her son, and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself, she felt depressed at being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about, she kept coming back in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha.",sadness
1572,She longed to look at his photograph and talk of him.,anger
1573,"Seizing the first pretext, she got up, and with her light, resolute step went for her album.",anger
1574,The stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.,joy
1575,"Just as she was leaving the drawing-room, a ring was heard in the hall.",anger
1576,“Who can that be?” said Dolly.,anger
1577,"“It’s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it’s late,” observed Kitty.",anger
1578,"“Sure to be someone with papers for me,” put in Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1579,"When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running up to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp.",joy
1580,"Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky, and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred in her heart.",love
1581,"He was standing still, not taking off his coat, pulling something out of his pocket.",anger
1582,"At the instant when she was just facing the stairs, he raised his eyes, caught sight of her, and into the expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and dismay.",sadness
1583,"With a slight inclination of her head she passed, hearing behind her Stepan Arkadyevitch’s loud voice calling him to come up, and the quiet, soft, and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.",anger
1584,"When Anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.",anger
1585,“And nothing would induce him to come up.,anger
1586,What a queer fellow he is!” added Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
1587,Kitty blushed.,anger
1588,"She thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come, and why he would not come up.",anger
1589,"“He has been at home,” she thought, “and didn’t find me, and thought I should be here, but he did not come up because he thought it late, and Anna’s here.” All of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at Anna’s album.",joy
1590,"There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man’s calling at half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in, but it seemed strange to all of them.",fear
1591,"Above all, it seemed strange and not right to Anna.",fear
1592,"The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats.",joy
1593,"From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as from a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before the mirror, they heard from the ballroom the careful, distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz.",joy
1594,"A little old man in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror, and diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know.",surprise
1595,"A beardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky called “young bucks,” in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille.",anger
1596,"As the first quadrille had already been given to Vronsky, she had to promise this youth the second.",anger
1597,"An officer, buttoning his glove, stood aside in the doorway, and stroking his mustache, admired rosy Kitty.",anger
1598,"Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment’s attention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her hair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of it.",joy
1599,"When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother, tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn back a little.",anger
1600,"She felt that everything must be right of itself, and graceful, and nothing could need setting straight.",joy
1601,It was one of Kitty’s best days.,joy
1602,"Her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not crushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels did not pinch, but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair.",joy
1603,All the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines.,anger
1604,The black velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck.,joy
1605,"That velvet was delicious; at home, looking at her neck in the looking-glass, Kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking.",joy
1606,"About all the rest there might be a doubt, but the velvet was delicious.",joy
1607,"Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she glanced at it in the glass.",anger
1608,"Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked.",love
1609,"Her eyes sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own attractiveness.",joy
1610,"She had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and flowers, waiting to be asked to dance—Kitty was never one of that throng—when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best partner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned director of dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka Korsunsky.",joy
1611,"He had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he had danced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom—that is to say, a few couples who had started dancing—he caught sight of Kitty, entering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which is confined to directors of balls.",anger
1612,"Without even asking her if she cared to dance, he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist.",anger
1613,"She looked round for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took it.",anger
1614,"“How nice you’ve come in good time,” he said to her, embracing her waist; “such a bad habit to be late.” Bending her left hand, she laid it on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music.",joy
1615,"“It’s a rest to waltz with you,” he said to her, as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz.",anger
1616,"“It’s exquisite—such lightness, precision.” He said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well.",joy
1617,"She smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room over his shoulder.",anger
1618,"She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland.",joy
1619,And she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome.,joy
1620,"But she was in the middle stage between these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had sufficient self-possession to be able to observe.",joy
1621,In the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.,anger
1622,"There—incredibly naked—was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky’s wife; there was the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always to be found where the best people were.",anger
1623,"In that direction gazed the young men, not venturing to approach.",joy
1624,"There, too, she descried Stiva, and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet gown.",joy
1625,And _he_ was there.,anger
1626,Kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused Levin.,anger
1627,"With her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once, and was even aware that he was looking at her.",anger
1628,"“Another turn, eh?",anger
1629,"You’re not tired?” said Korsunsky, a little out of breath.",anger
1630,"“No, thank you!” “Where shall I take you?” “Madame Karenina’s here, I think ... take me to her.” “Wherever you command.” And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in the left corner, continually saying, “Pardon, mesdames, pardon, pardon, mesdames”; and steering his course through the sea of lace, tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his partner sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent stockings, were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape and covered Krivin’s knees.",joy
1631,"Korsunsky bowed, set straight his open shirt front, and gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna.",anger
1632,"Kitty, flushed, took her train from Krivin’s knees, and, a little giddy, looked round, seeking Anna.",joy
1633,"Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had so urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her full throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists.",anger
1634,The whole gown was trimmed with Venetian guipure.,joy
1635,"On her head, among her black hair—her own, with no false additions—was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace.",sadness
1636,Her coiffure was not striking.,anger
1637,All that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples.,joy
1638,"Round her well-cut, strong neck was a thread of pearls.",anger
1639,"Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured her invariably in lilac.",anger
1640,"But now seeing her in black, she felt that she had not fully seen her charm.",joy
1641,She saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her.,surprise
1642,"Now she understood that Anna could not have been in lilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her.",joy
1643,"And her black dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was only the frame, and all that was seen was she—simple, natural, elegant, and at the same time gay and eager.",joy
1644,"She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her head slightly turned towards him.",anger
1645,"“No, I don’t throw stones,” she was saying, in answer to something, “though I can’t understand it,” she went on, shrugging her shoulders, and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty.",anger
1646,"With a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made a movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty, signifying approval of her dress and her looks.",joy
1647,"“You came into the room dancing,” she added.",joy
1648,"“This is one of my most faithful supporters,” said Korsunsky, bowing to Anna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen.",anger
1649,“The princess helps to make balls happy and successful.,joy
1650,"Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?” he said, bending down to her.",anger
1651,"“Why, have you met?” inquired their host.",anger
1652,“Is there anyone we have not met?,anger
1653,"My wife and I are like white wolves—everyone knows us,” answered Korsunsky.",joy
1654,"“A waltz, Anna Arkadyevna?” “I don’t dance when it’s possible not to dance,” she said.",joy
1655,"“But tonight it’s impossible,” answered Korsunsky.",anger
1656,At that instant Vronsky came up.,anger
1657,"“Well, since it’s impossible tonight, let us start,” she said, not noticing Vronsky’s bow, and she hastily put her hand on Korsunsky’s shoulder.",anger
1658,"“What is she vexed with him about?” thought Kitty, discerning that Anna had intentionally not responded to Vronsky’s bow.",anger
1659,"Vronsky went up to Kitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing his regret that he had not seen her all this time.",joy
1660,"Kitty gazed in admiration at Anna waltzing, and listened to him.",anger
1661,"She expected him to ask her for a waltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly at him.",anger
1662,"He flushed slightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped.",anger
1663,"Kitty looked into his face, which was so close to her own, and long afterwards—for several years after—that look, full of love, to which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony of shame.",sadness
1664,“_Pardon!,anger
1665,pardon!_ Waltz!,anger
1666,"waltz!” shouted Korsunsky from the other side of the room, and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself.",anger
1667,Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room.,anger
1668,"After the first waltz Kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to say a few words to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first quadrille.",anger
1669,"During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said: there was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys, husband and wife, whom he described very amusingly, as delightful children at forty, and of the future town theater; and only once the conversation touched her to the quick, when he asked her about Levin, whether he was here, and added that he liked him so much.",joy
1670,But Kitty did not expect much from the quadrille.,anger
1671,She looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka.,joy
1672,She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided.,anger
1673,The fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her.,anger
1674,"She felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she had done at former balls, and refused five young men, saying she was engaged for the mazurka.",joy
1675,"The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors, sounds, and motions.",joy
1676,She only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest.,sadness
1677,"But as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse, she chanced to be _vis-à-vis_ with Vronsky and Anna.",anger
1678,"She had not been near Anna again since the beginning of the evening, and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising.",surprise
1679,She saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself; she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting.,joy
1680,"She knew that feeling and knew its signs, and saw them in Anna; saw the quivering, flashing light in her eyes, and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips, and the deliberate grace, precision, and lightness of her movements.",joy
1681,“Who?” she asked herself.,anger
1682,"“All or one?” And not assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation, the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again, she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into the _grand rond_, and then into the _chaîne_, and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart.",joy
1683,"“No, it’s not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one.",joy
1684,And that one?,anger
1685,"can it be he?” Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red lips.",joy
1686,"She seemed to make an effort to control herself, to try not to show these signs of delight, but they came out on her face of themselves.",anger
1687,“But what of him?” Kitty looked at him and was filled with terror.,fear
1688,What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna’s face she saw in him.,anger
1689,"What had become of his always self-possessed resolute manner, and the carelessly serene expression of his face?",joy
1690,"Now every time he turned to her, he bent his head, as though he would have fallen at her feet, and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread.",joy
1691,"“I would not offend you,” his eyes seemed every time to be saying, “but I want to save myself, and I don’t know how.” On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.",anger
1692,"They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial conversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers.",anger
1693,"And strange it was that they were actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French, and how the Eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words had all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as Kitty did.",joy
1694,"The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in fog in Kitty’s soul.",sadness
1695,"Nothing but the stern discipline of her bringing-up supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her, that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile.",joy
1696,"But before the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room, a moment of despair and horror came for Kitty.",sadness
1697,"She had refused five partners, and now she was not dancing the mazurka.",anger
1698,"She had not even a hope of being asked for it, because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now.",joy
1699,"She would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home, but she had not the strength to do this.",anger
1700,She felt crushed.,sadness
1701,She went to the furthest end of the little drawing-room and sank into a low chair.,sadness
1702,"Her light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan, and with rapid, short strokes fanned her burning face.",sadness
1703,"But while she looked like a butterfly, clinging to a blade of grass, and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight, her heart ached with a horrible despair.",sadness
1704,"“But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?” And again she recalled all she had seen.",anger
1705,"“Kitty, what is it?” said Countess Nordston, stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her.",anger
1706,“I don’t understand it.” Kitty’s lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly.,anger
1707,"“Kitty, you’re not dancing the mazurka?” “No, no,” said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.",sadness
1708,"“He asked her for the mazurka before me,” said Countess Nordston, knowing Kitty would understand who were “he” and “her.” “She said: ‘Why, aren’t you going to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya?’” “Oh, I don’t care!” answered Kitty.",anger
1709,"No one but she herself understood her position; no one knew that she had just refused the man whom perhaps she loved, and refused him because she had put her faith in another.",anger
1710,"Countess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the mazurka, and told him to ask Kitty.",anger
1711,"Kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had not to talk, because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure.",anger
1712,Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her.,anger
1713,"She saw them with her long-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the figures, and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was complete.",joy
1714,She saw that they felt themselves alone in that crowded room.,sadness
1715,"And on Vronsky’s face, always so firm and independent, she saw that look that had struck her, of bewilderment and humble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong.",joy
1716,"Anna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him.",anger
1717,"She grew thoughtful, and he became serious.",joy
1718,Some supernatural force drew Kitty’s eyes to Anna’s face.,anger
1719,"She was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her little feet and hands, fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness, but there was something terrible and cruel in her fascination.",surprise
1720,"Kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her suffering.",anger
1721,"Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it.",fear
1722,"When Vronsky saw her, coming across her in the mazurka, he did not at once recognize her, she was so changed.",anger
1723,"“Delightful ball!” he said to her, for the sake of saying something.",anger
1724,"“Yes,” she answered.",anger
1725,"In the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly invented by Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center of the circle, chose two gentlemen, and summoned a lady and Kitty.",anger
1726,Kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up.,anger
1727,"Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and smiled, pressing her hand.",anger
1728,"But, noticing that Kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement, she turned away from her, and began gaily talking to the other lady.",anger
1729,"“Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her,” Kitty said to herself.",surprise
1730,"Anna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began to press her to do so.",anger
1731,"“Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,” said Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat, “I’ve such an idea for a _cotillion!",joy
1732,"Un bijou!_” And he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him.",anger
1733,Their host smiled approvingly.,joy
1734,"“No, I am not going to stay,” answered Anna, smiling, but in spite of her smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay.",joy
1735,"“No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I have all the winter in Petersburg,” said Anna, looking round at Vronsky, who stood near her.",anger
1736,“I must rest a little before my journey.” “Are you certainly going tomorrow then?” asked Vronsky.,anger
1737,"“Yes, I suppose so,” answered Anna, as it were wondering at the boldness of his question; but the irrepressible, quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it.",anger
1738,"Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home.",anger
1739,"“Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,” thought Levin, as he came away from the Shtcherbatskys’, and walked in the direction of his brother’s lodgings.",anger
1740,“And I don’t get on with other people.,anger
1741,"Pride, they say.",joy
1742,"No, I have no pride.",joy
1743,"If I had any pride, I should not have put myself in such a position.” And he pictured to himself Vronsky, happy, good-natured, clever, and self-possessed, certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening.",joy
1744,"“Yes, she was bound to choose him.",anger
1745,"So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone or anything.",anger
1746,I am myself to blame.,anger
1747,What right had I to imagine she would care to join her life to mine?,anger
1748,Who am I and what am I?,anger
1749,"A nobody, not wanted by anyone, nor of use to anybody.” And he recalled his brother Nikolay, and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him.",anger
1750,“Isn’t he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome?,joy
1751,And are we fair in our judgment of brother Nikolay?,joy
1752,"Of course, from the point of view of Prokofy, seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy, he’s a despicable person.",anger
1753,But I know him differently.,anger
1754,"I know his soul, and know that we are like him.",anger
1755,"And I, instead of going to seek him out, went out to dinner, and came here.” Levin walked up to a lamppost, read his brother’s address, which was in his pocketbook, and called a sledge.",anger
1756,"All the long way to his brother’s, Levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother Nikolay’s life.",joy
1757,"He remembered how his brother, while at the university, and for a year afterwards, had, in spite of the jeers of his companions, lived like a monk, strictly observing all religious rites, services, and fasts, and avoiding every sort of pleasure, especially women.",sadness
1758,"And afterwards, how he had all at once broken out: he had associated with the most horrible people, and rushed into the most senseless debauchery.",anger
1759,"He remembered later the scandal over a boy, whom he had taken from the country to bring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding.",anger
1760,"Then he recalled the scandal with a sharper, to whom he had lost money, and given a promissory note, and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint, asserting that he had cheated him.",anger
1761,(This was the money Sergey Ivanovitch had paid.),anger
1762,Then he remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street.,anger
1763,"He remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother Sergey Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of his mother’s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder....",anger
1764,"It was all horribly disgusting, yet to Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all his story, did not know his heart.",anger
1765,"Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the period of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone, far from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the others.",anger
1766,"They had teased him, called him Noah, and monk; and, when he had broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust.",sadness
1767,"Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother Nikolay, in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him.",sadness
1768,He was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence.,joy
1769,But he had always wanted to be good.,joy
1770,"“I will tell him everything, without reserve, and I will make him speak without reserve, too, and I’ll show him that I love him, and so understand him,” Levin resolved to himself, as, towards eleven o’clock, he reached the hotel of which he had the address.",joy
1771,"“At the top, 12 and 13,” the porter answered Levin’s inquiry.",anger
1772,“At home?” “Sure to be at home.” The door of No.,anger
1773,"12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice, unknown to Levin; but he knew at once that his brother was there; he heard his cough.",sadness
1774,"As he went in the door, the unknown voice was saying: “It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing’s done.” Konstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was sitting on the sofa.",sadness
1775,His brother was not to be seen.,anger
1776,Konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life.,fear
1777,"No one had heard him, and Konstantin, taking off his galoshes, listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was saying.",anger
1778,He was speaking of some enterprise.,anger
1779,"“Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,” his brother’s voice responded, with a cough.",anger
1780,“Masha!,anger
1781,"get us some supper and some wine if there’s any left; or else go and get some.” The woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.",anger
1782,"“There’s some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,” she said.",anger
1783,"“Whom do you want?” said the voice of Nikolay Levin, angrily.",anger
1784,"“It’s I,” answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward into the light.",anger
1785,"“Who’s _I_?” Nikolay’s voice said again, still more angrily.",joy
1786,"He could be heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling against something, and Levin saw, facing him in the doorway, the big, scared eyes, and the huge, thin, stooping figure of his brother, so familiar, and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness.",fear
1787,"He was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had seen him last.",anger
1788,"He was wearing a short coat, and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever.",fear
1789,"His hair had grown thinner, the same straight mustaches hid his lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and naïvely at his visitor.",joy
1790,"“Ah, Kostya!” he exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his brother, and his eyes lit up with joy.",joy
1791,"But the same second he looked round at the young man, and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that Konstantin knew so well, as if his neckband hurt him; and a quite different expression, wild, suffering, and cruel, rested on his emaciated face.",anger
1792,“I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don’t know you and don’t want to know you.,anger
1793,What is it you want?” He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him.,anger
1794,"The worst and most tiresome part of his character, what made all relations with him so difficult, had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he thought of him, and now, when he saw his face, and especially that nervous twitching of his head, he remembered it all.",fear
1795,"“I didn’t want to see you for anything,” he answered timidly.",anger
1796,“I’ve simply come to see you.” His brother’s timidity obviously softened Nikolay.,anger
1797,His lips twitched.,anger
1798,"“Oh, so that’s it?” he said.",anger
1799,"“Well, come in; sit down.",anger
1800,Like some supper?,anger
1801,"Masha, bring supper for three.",anger
1802,"No, stop a minute.",anger
1803,"Do you know who this is?” he said, addressing his brother, and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin: “This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a very remarkable man.",joy
1804,"He’s persecuted by the police, of course, because he’s not a scoundrel.” And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.",anger
1805,"Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he shouted to her, “Wait a minute, I said.” And with the inability to express himself, the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well, he began, with another look round at everyone, to tell his brother Kritsky’s story: how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools; and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how he had been driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned for something.",sadness
1806,"“You’re of the Kiev university?” said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky, to break the awkward silence that followed.",sadness
1807,"“Yes, I was of Kiev,” Kritsky replied angrily, his face darkening.",anger
1808,"“And this woman,” Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to her, “is the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna.",anger
1809,"I took her out of a bad house,” and he jerked his neck saying this; “but I love her and respect her, and anyone who wants to know me,” he added, raising his voice and knitting his brows, “I beg to love her and respect her.",sadness
1810,"She’s just the same as my wife, just the same.",anger
1811,So now you know whom you’ve to do with.,anger
1812,"And if you think you’re lowering yourself, well, here’s the floor, there’s the door.” And again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.",joy
1813,"“Why I should be lowering myself, I don’t understand.” “Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits and wine.... No, wait a minute.... No, it doesn’t matter.... Go along.” “So you see,” pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching.",anger
1814,It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.,anger
1815,"“Here, do you see?”...",anger
1816,"He pointed to some sort of iron bars, fastened together with strings, lying in a corner of the room.",anger
1817,“Do you see that?,anger
1818,That’s the beginning of a new thing we’re going into.,joy
1819,It’s a productive association....” Konstantin scarcely heard him.,joy
1820,"He looked into his sickly, consumptive face, and he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association.",anger
1821,He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from self-contempt.,anger
1822,Nikolay Levin went on talking: “You know that capital oppresses the laborer.,anger
1823,"The laborers with us, the peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however much they work they can’t escape from their position of beasts of burden.",anger
1824,"All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education, all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists.",sadness
1825,"And society’s so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of burden to the end.",anger
1826,"And that state of things must be changed,” he finished up, and he looked questioningly at his brother.",anger
1827,"“Yes, of course,” said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother’s projecting cheekbones.",anger
1828,"“And so we’re founding a locksmiths’ association, where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common.” “Where is the association to be?” asked Konstantin Levin.",anger
1829,"“In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.” “But why in a village?",anger
1830,"In the villages, I think, there is plenty of work as it is.",joy
1831,Why a locksmiths’ association in a village?” “Why?,joy
1832,"Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were, and that’s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don’t like people to try and get them out of their slavery,” said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the objection.",anger
1833,"Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room.",anger
1834,This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.,joy
1835,“I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch’s aristocratic views.,anger
1836,"I know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils.” “No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?” said Levin, smiling.",joy
1837,“Sergey Ivanovitch?,anger
1838,I’ll tell you what for!” Nikolay Levin shrieked suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch.,anger
1839,“I’ll tell you what for....,anger
1840,But what’s the use of talking?,anger
1841,There’s only one thing.... What did you come to me for?,anger
1842,"You look down on this, and you’re welcome to,—and go away, in God’s name go away!” he shrieked, getting up from his chair.",anger
1843,"“And go away, and go away!” “I don’t look down on it at all,” said Konstantin Levin timidly.",anger
1844,“I don’t even dispute it.” At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back.,anger
1845,Nikolay Levin looked round angrily at her.,anger
1846,"She went quickly to him, and whispered something.",anger
1847,"“I’m not well; I’ve grown irritable,” said Nikolay Levin, getting calmer and breathing painfully; “and then you talk to me of Sergey Ivanovitch and his article.",anger
1848,"It’s such rubbish, such lying, such self-deception.",sadness
1849,What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it?,anger
1850,"Have you read his article?” he asked Kritsky, sitting down again at the table, and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes, so as to clear a space.",joy
1851,"“I’ve not read it,” Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation.",anger
1852,"“Why not?” said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation upon Kritsky.",anger
1853,"“Because I didn’t see the use of wasting my time over it.” “Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?",anger
1854,That article’s too deep for many people—that’s to say it’s over their heads.,anger
1855,"But with me, it’s another thing; I see through his ideas, and I know where its weakness lies.” Everyone was mute.",anger
1856,Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.,anger
1857,“Won’t you have supper?,anger
1858,"All right, good-bye!",joy
1859,Come round tomorrow with the locksmith.” Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.,anger
1860,"“He’s no good either,” he said.",joy
1861,"“I see, of course....” But at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him.... “What do you want now?” he said, and went out to him in the passage.",anger
1862,"Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna, Levin turned to her.",anger
1863,“Have you been long with my brother?” he said to her.,anger
1864,"“Yes, more than a year.",joy
1865,Nikolay Dmitrievitch’s health has become very poor.,sadness
1866,"Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal,” she said.",joy
1867,"“That is ... how does he drink?” “Drinks vodka, and it’s bad for him.” “And a great deal?” whispered Levin.",anger
1868,"“Yes,” she said, looking timidly towards the doorway, where Nikolay Levin had reappeared.",anger
1869,"“What were you talking about?” he said, knitting his brows, and turning his scared eyes from one to the other.",fear
1870,"“What was it?” “Oh, nothing,” Konstantin answered in confusion.",anger
1871,"“Oh, if you don’t want to say, don’t.",anger
1872,Only it’s no good your talking to her.,joy
1873,"She’s a wench, and you’re a gentleman,” he said with a jerk of the neck.",anger
1874,"“You understand everything, I see, and have taken stock of everything, and look with commiseration on my shortcomings,” he began again, raising his voice.",joy
1875,"“Nikolay Dmitrievitch, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,” whispered Marya Nikolaevna, again going up to him.",anger
1876,"“Oh, very well, very well!...",joy
1877,But where’s the supper?,anger
1878,"Ah, here it is,” he said, seeing a waiter with a tray.",joy
1879,"“Here, set it here,” he added angrily, and promptly seizing the vodka, he poured out a glassful and drank it greedily.",anger
1880,"“Like a drink?” he turned to his brother, and at once became better humored.",anger
1881,"“Well, enough of Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
1882,"I’m glad to see you, anyway.",joy
1883,"After all’s said and done, we’re not strangers.",anger
1884,"Come, have a drink.",anger
1885,"Tell me what you’re doing,” he went on, greedily munching a piece of bread, and pouring out another glassful.",anger
1886,"“How are you living?” “I live alone in the country, as I used to.",anger
1887,"I’m busy looking after the land,” answered Konstantin, watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank, and trying to conceal that he noticed it.",anger
1888,"“Why don’t you get married?” “It hasn’t happened so,” Konstantin answered, reddening a little.",anger
1889,“Why not?,joy
1890,For me now ... everything’s at an end!,anger
1891,I’ve made a mess of my life.,anger
1892,"But this I’ve said, and I say still, that if my share had been given me when I needed it, my whole life would have been different.” Konstantin made haste to change the conversation.",anger
1893,"“Do you know your little Vanya’s with me, a clerk in the countinghouse at Pokrovskoe.” Nikolay jerked his neck, and sank into thought.",anger
1894,"“Yes, tell me what’s going on at Pokrovskoe.",anger
1895,"Is the house standing still, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom?",joy
1896,"And Philip the gardener, is he living?",anger
1897,How I remember the arbor and the seat!,anger
1898,"Now mind and don’t alter anything in the house, but make haste and get married, and make everything as it used to be again.",joy
1899,"Then I’ll come and see you, if your wife is nice.” “But come to me now,” said Levin.",joy
1900,“How nicely we would arrange it!” “I’d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey Ivanovitch.” “You wouldn’t find him there.,joy
1901,"I live quite independently of him.” “Yes, but say what you like, you will have to choose between me and him,” he said, looking timidly into his brother’s face.",sadness
1902,This timidity touched Konstantin.,anger
1903,"“If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell you that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side.",anger
1904,You’re both wrong.,anger
1905,"You’re more wrong externally, and he inwardly.” “Ah, ah!",anger
1906,"You see that, you see that!” Nikolay shouted joyfully.",anger
1907,"“But I personally value friendly relations with you more because....” “Why, why?” Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was unhappy, and needed affection.",sadness
1908,"But Nikolay knew that this was just what he meant to say, and scowling he took up the vodka again.",anger
1909,"“Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!” said Marya Nikolaevna, stretching out her plump, bare arm towards the decanter.",anger
1910,“Let it be!,anger
1911,Don’t insist!,anger
1912,I’ll beat you!” he shouted.,anger
1913,"Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which was at once reflected on Nikolay’s face, and she took the bottle.",anger
1914,“And do you suppose she understands nothing?” said Nikolay.,joy
1915,“She understands it all better than any of us.,joy
1916,"Isn’t it true there’s something good and sweet in her?” “Were you never before in Moscow?” Konstantin said to her, for the sake of saying something.",joy
1917,“Only you mustn’t be polite and stiff with her.,anger
1918,It frightens her.,anger
1919,No one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill-fame.,anger
1920,"Mercy on us, the senselessness in the world!” he cried suddenly.",anger
1921,"“These new institutions, these justices of the peace, rural councils, what hideousness it all is!” And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions.",joy
1922,"Konstantin Levin heard him, and the disbelief in the sense of all public institutions, which he shared with him, and often expressed, was distasteful to him now from his brother’s lips.",sadness
1923,"“In another world we shall understand it all,” he said lightly.",joy
1924,“In another world!,joy
1925,"Ah, I don’t like that other world!",joy
1926,"I don’t like it,” he said, letting his scared eyes rest on his brother’s eyes.",fear
1927,"“Here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess, one’s own and other people’s, would be a good thing, and yet I’m afraid of death, awfully afraid of death.” He shuddered.",fear
1928,“But do drink something.,anger
1929,Would you like some champagne?,anger
1930,Or shall we go somewhere?,anger
1931,Let’s go to the Gypsies!,anger
1932,"Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian songs.” His speech had begun to falter, and he passed abruptly from one subject to another.",anger
1933,"Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere, and got him to bed hopelessly drunk.",anger
1934,"Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade Nikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother.",anger
1935,"In the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and towards evening he reached home.",anger
1936,"On the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors about politics and the new railways, and, just as in Moscow, he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with himself, shame of something or other.",sadness
1937,"But when he got out at his own station, when he saw his one-eyed coachman, Ignat, with the collar of his coat turned up; when, in the dim light reflected by the station fires, he saw his own sledge, his own horses with their tails tied up, in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman Ignat, as he put in his luggage, told him the village news, that the contractor had arrived, and that Pava had calved,—he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up, and the shame and self-dissatisfaction were passing away.",sadness
1938,"He felt this at the mere sight of Ignat and the horses; but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him, had sat down wrapped up in the sledge, and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village, and staring at the side-horse, that had been his saddle-horse, past his prime now, but a spirited beast from the Don, he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light.",joy
1939,"He felt himself, and did not want to be anyone else.",joy
1940,All he wanted now was to be better than before.,joy
1941,"In the first place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary happiness, such as marriage must have given him, and consequently he would not so disdain what he really had.",anger
1942,"Secondly, he would never again let himself give way to low passion, the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make an offer.",anger
1943,"Then remembering his brother Nikolay, he resolved to himself that he would never allow himself to forget him, that he would follow him up, and not lose sight of him, so as to be ready to help when things should go ill with him.",anger
1944,"And that would be soon, he felt.",sadness
1945,"Then, too, his brother’s talk of communism, which he had treated so lightly at the time, now made him think.",anger
1946,He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense.,anger
1947,"But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury.",joy
1948,And all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in the pleasantest daydreams.,anger
1949,"With a resolute feeling of hope in a new, better life, he reached home before nine o’clock at night.",joy
1950,"The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the bedroom windows of his old nurse, Agafea Mihalovna, who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house.",anger
1951,She was not yet asleep.,fear
1952,"Kouzma, waked up by her, came sidling sleepily out onto the steps.",anger
1953,"A setter bitch, Laska, ran out too, almost upsetting Kouzma, and whining, turned round about Levin’s knees, jumping up and longing, but not daring, to put her forepaws on his chest.",anger
1954,"“You’re soon back again, sir,” said Agafea Mihalovna.",anger
1955,"“I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna.",anger
1956,"With friends, one is well; but at home, one is better,” he answered, and went into his study.",anger
1957,The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in.,anger
1958,"The familiar details came out: the stag’s horns, the bookshelves, the looking-glass, the stove with its ventilator, which had long wanted mending, his father’s sofa, a large table, on the table an open book, a broken ashtray, a manuscript book with his handwriting.",anger
1959,"As he saw all this, there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life, of which he had been dreaming on the road.",anger
1960,"All these traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to say to him: “No, you’re not going to get away from us, and you’re not going to be different, but you’re going to be the same as you’ve always been; with doubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to amend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you won’t get, and which isn’t possible for you.” This the things said to him, but another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past, and that one can do anything with oneself.",sadness
1961,"And hearing that voice, he went into the corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells, and began brandishing them like a gymnast, trying to restore his confident temper.",joy
1962,There was a creak of steps at the door.,anger
1963,He hastily put down the dumbbells.,anger
1964,"The bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well; but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched.",joy
1965,This piece of news irritated Levin.,anger
1966,The new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin.,anger
1967,"The bailiff had always been against the drying machine, and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched.",joy
1968,"Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched, it was only because the precautions had not been taken, for which he had hundreds of times given orders.",anger
1969,"He was annoyed, and reprimanded the bailiff.",anger
1970,"But there had been an important and joyful event: Pava, his best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had calved.",joy
1971,"“Kouzma, give me my sheepskin.",anger
1972,And you tell them to take a lantern.,anger
1973,"I’ll come and look at her,” he said to the bailiff.",anger
1974,The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house.,joy
1975,"Walking across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree, he went into the cowhouse.",anger
1976,"There was the warm, steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened, and the cows, astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern, stirred on the fresh straw.",joy
1977,"He caught a glimpse of the broad, smooth, black and piebald back of Hollandka.",joy
1978,"Berkoot, the bull, was lying down with his ring in his lip, and seemed about to get up, but thought better of it, and only gave two snorts as they passed by him.",anger
1979,"Pava, a perfect beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with her back turned to them, prevented their seeing the calf, as she sniffed her all over.",joy
1980,"Levin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long, tottering legs.",anger
1981,"Pava, uneasy, began lowing, but when Levin put the calf close to her she was soothed, and, sighing heavily, began licking her with her rough tongue.",fear
1982,"The calf, fumbling, poked her nose under her mother’s udder, and stiffened her tail out straight.",anger
1983,"“Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way,” said Levin, examining the calf.",anger
1984,“Like the mother!,anger
1985,though the color takes after the father; but that’s nothing.,anger
1986,Very good.,joy
1987,Long and broad in the haunch.,anger
1988,"Vassily Fedorovitch, isn’t she splendid?” he said to the bailiff, quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf.",joy
1989,“How could she fail to be?,anger
1990,"Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after you left.",anger
1991,"You must settle with him, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said the bailiff.",anger
1992,"“I did inform you about the machine.” This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his work on the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated.",anger
1993,"He went straight from the cowhouse to the counting house, and after a little conversation with the bailiff and Semyon the contractor, he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing-room.",anger
1994,"The house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived alone, had the whole house heated and used.",anger
1995,"He knew that this was stupid, he knew that it was positively not right, and contrary to his present new plans, but this house was a whole world to Levin.",anger
1996,It was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died.,anger
1997,"They had lived just the life that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection, and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife, his family.",anger
1998,Levin scarcely remembered his mother.,anger
1999,"His conception of her was for him a sacred memory, and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been.",anger
2000,"He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family, and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family.",anger
2001,"His ideas of marriage were, consequently, quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances, for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life.",joy
2002,"For Levin it was the chief affair of life, on which its whole happiness turned.",anger
2003,And now he had to give up that.,anger
2004,"When he had gone into the little drawing-room, where he always had tea, and had settled himself in his armchair with a book, and Agafea Mihalovna had brought him tea, and with her usual, “Well, I’ll stay a while, sir,” had taken a chair in the window, he felt that, however strange it might be, he had not parted from his daydreams, and that he could not live without them.",fear
2005,"Whether with her, or with another, still it would be.",anger
2006,"He was reading a book, and thinking of what he was reading, and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna, who gossiped away without flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his imagination.",joy
2007,"He felt that in the depth of his soul something had been put in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.",sadness
2008,"He heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his duty to God, and with the money Levin had given him to buy a horse, had been drinking without stopping, and had beaten his wife till he’d half killed her.",anger
2009,"He listened, and read his book, and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his reading.",anger
2010,It was Tyndall’s _Treatise on Heat_.,anger
2011,"He recalled his own criticisms of Tyndall of his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments, and for his lack of philosophic insight.",joy
2012,"And suddenly there floated into his mind the joyful thought: “In two years’ time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava herself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young daughters of Berkoot and the three others—how lovely!” He took up his book again.",joy
2013,"“Very good, electricity and heat are the same thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the solution of any problem?",joy
2014,No.,joy
2015,"Well, then what of it?",joy
2016,"The connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively.... It’s particulary nice if Pava’s daughter should be a red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other three, too!",joy
2017,Splendid!,joy
2018,"To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd.... My wife says, ‘Kostya and I looked after that calf like a child.’ ‘How can it interest you so much?’ says a visitor.",joy
2019,"‘Everything that interests him, interests me.’ But who will she be?” And he remembered what had happened at Moscow.... “Well, there’s nothing to be done.... It’s not my fault.",anger
2020,But now everything shall go on in a new way.,joy
2021,"It’s nonsense to pretend that life won’t let one, that the past won’t let one.",anger
2022,"One must struggle to live better, much better.”...",joy
2023,"He raised his head, and fell to dreaming.",sadness
2024,"Old Laska, who had not yet fully digested her delight at his return, and had run out into the yard to bark, came back wagging her tail, and crept up to him, bringing in the scent of fresh air, put her head under his hand, and whined plaintively, asking to be stroked.",joy
2025,"“There, who’d have thought it?” said Agafea Mihalovna.",anger
2026,"“The dog now ... why, she understands that her master’s come home, and that he’s low-spirited.” “Why low-spirited?” “Do you suppose I don’t see it, sir?",anger
2027,It’s high time I should know the gentry.,anger
2028,"Why, I’ve grown up from a little thing with them.",anger
2029,"It’s nothing, sir, so long as there’s health and a clear conscience.” Levin looked intently at her, surprised at how well she knew his thought.",joy
2030,"“Shall I fetch you another cup?” said she, and taking his cup she went out.",anger
2031,Laska kept poking her head under his hand.,anger
2032,"He stroked her, and she promptly curled up at his feet, laying her head on a hindpaw.",anger
2033,"And in token of all now being well and satisfactory, she opened her mouth a little, smacked her lips, and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth, she sank into blissful repose.",joy
2034,Levin watched all her movements attentively.,fear
2035,"“That’s what I’ll do,” he said to himself; “that’s what I’ll do!",anger
2036,"Nothing’s amiss.... All’s well.” After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day.",anger
2037,"“No, I must go, I must go”; she explained to her sister-in-law the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them: “no, it had really better be today!” Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven o’clock.",joy
2038,"Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache.",anger
2039,Dolly and Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess.,anger
2040,"Whether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute senses, and felt that Anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her, that she was not now interested in them,—but they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt, and their love for her, and were quite indifferent that she was going away.",anger
2041,Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure.,joy
2042,"She wrote notes to her Moscow acquaintances, put down her accounts, and packed.",anger
2043,"Altogether Dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew well with herself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self.",joy
2044,"After dinner, Anna went up to her room to dress, and Dolly followed her.",anger
2045,“How queer you are today!” Dolly said to her.,anger
2046,“I?,anger
2047,Do you think so?,joy
2048,"I’m not queer, but I’m nasty.",anger
2049,I am like that sometimes.,anger
2050,I keep feeling as if I could cry.,sadness
2051,"It’s very stupid, but it’ll pass off,” said Anna quickly, and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs.",anger
2052,"Her eyes were particularly bright, and were continually swimming with tears.",joy
2053,"“In the same way I didn’t want to leave Petersburg, and now I don’t want to go away from here.” “You came here and did a good deed,” said Dolly, looking intently at her.",joy
2054,Anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.,sadness
2055,"“Don’t say that, Dolly.",joy
2056,"I’ve done nothing, and could do nothing.",joy
2057,I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me.,anger
2058,"What have I done, and what could I do?",anger
2059,"In your heart there was found love enough to forgive....” “If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened!",anger
2060,"How happy you are, Anna!” said Dolly.",joy
2061,"“Everything is clear and good in your heart.” “Every heart has its own _skeletons_, as the English say.” “You have no sort of _skeleton_, have you?",joy
2062,"Everything is so clear in you.” “I have!” said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears, a sly, ironical smile curved her lips.",joy
2063,"“Come, he’s amusing, anyway, your _skeleton_, and not depressing,” said Dolly, smiling.",joy
2064,"“No, he’s depressing.",sadness
2065,Do you know why I’m going today instead of tomorrow?,anger
2066,"It’s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to you,” said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and looking straight into Dolly’s face.",joy
2067,"And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears, up to the curly black ringlets on her neck.",anger
2068,"“Yes,” Anna went on.",anger
2069,“Do you know why Kitty didn’t come to dinner?,anger
2070,She’s jealous of me.,anger
2071,I have spoiled ... I’ve been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure.,anger
2072,"But truly, truly, it’s not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,” she said, daintily drawling the words “a little bit.” “Oh, how like Stiva you said that!” said Dolly, laughing.",anger
2073,Anna was hurt.,anger
2074,"“Oh no, oh no!",joy
2075,"I’m not Stiva,” she said, knitting her brows.",anger
2076,"“That’s why I’m telling you, just because I could never let myself doubt myself for an instant,” said Anna.",joy
2077,"But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they were not true.",joy
2078,"She was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at the thought of Vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant, simply to avoid meeting him.",sadness
2079,"“Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he....” “You can’t imagine how absurdly it all came about.",anger
2080,"I only meant to be matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently.",anger
2081,Possibly against my own will....” She crimsoned and stopped.,anger
2082,"“Oh, they feel it directly?” said Dolly.",joy
2083,"“But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side,” Anna interrupted her.",anger
2084,"“And I am certain it will all be forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.” “All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I’m not very anxious for this marriage for Kitty.",fear
2085,"And it’s better it should come to nothing, if he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.” “Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!” said Anna, and again a deep flush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the idea, that absorbed her, put into words.",sadness
2086,"“And so here I am going away, having made an enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much!",anger
2087,"Ah, how sweet she is!",joy
2088,"But you’ll make it right, Dolly?",anger
2089,Eh?” Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile.,joy
2090,"She loved Anna, but she enjoyed seeing that she too had her weaknesses.",joy
2091,“An enemy?,anger
2092,"That can’t be.” “I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care for you more than ever,” said Anna, with tears in her eyes.",sadness
2093,"“Ah, how silly I am today!” She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.",anger
2094,"At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy and good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.",joy
2095,"Anna’s emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her sister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: “Remember, Anna, what you’ve done for me—I shall never forget.",anger
2096,"And remember that I love you, and shall always love you as my dearest friend!” “I don’t know why,” said Anna, kissing her and hiding her tears.",sadness
2097,"“You understood me, and you understand.",anger
2098,"Good-bye, my darling!” “Come, it’s all over, and thank God!” was the first thought that came to Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said good-bye for the last time to her brother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang.",anger
2099,"She sat down on her lounge beside Annushka, and looked about her in the twilight of the sleeping-carriage.",anger
2100,“Thank God!,anger
2101,"tomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch, and my life will go on in the old way, all nice and as usual.” Still in the same anxious frame of mind, as she had been all that day, Anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care.",joy
2102,"With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag, took out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping up her feet, settled herself comfortably.",joy
2103,An invalid lady had already lain down to sleep.,anger
2104,"Two other ladies began talking to Anna, and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet, and made observations about the heating of the train.",anger
2105,"Anna answered a few words, but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a lamp, hooked it onto the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper-knife and an English novel.",anger
2106,At first her reading made no progress.,anger
2107,"The fuss and bustle were disturbing; then when the train had started, she could not help listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard passing by, covered with snow on one side, and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside, distracted her attention.",anger
2108,"Farther on, it was continually the same again and again: the same shaking and rattling, the same snow on the window, the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight, and the same voices, and Anna began to read and to understand what she read.",anger
2109,"Annushka was already dozing, the red bag on her lap, clutched by her broad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn.",fear
2110,"Anna Arkadyevna read and understood, but it was distasteful to her to read, that is, to follow the reflection of other people’s lives.",anger
2111,She had too great a desire to live herself.,joy
2112,"If she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man; if she read of a member of Parliament making a speech, she longed to be delivering the speech; if she read of how Lady Mary had ridden after the hounds, and had provoked her sister-in-law, and had surprised everyone by her boldness, she too wished to be doing the same.",anger
2113,"But there was no chance of doing anything; and twisting the smooth paper-knife in her little hands, she forced herself to read.",anger
2114,"The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English happiness, a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to go with him to the estate, when she suddenly felt that _he_ ought to feel ashamed, and that she was ashamed of the same thing.",sadness
2115,But what had he to be ashamed of?,sadness
2116,“What have I to be ashamed of?” she asked herself in injured surprise.,fear
2117,"She laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair, tightly gripping the paper-cutter in both hands.",fear
2118,There was nothing.,joy
2119,She went over all her Moscow recollections.,sadness
2120,"All were good, pleasant.",joy
2121,"She remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his face of slavish adoration, remembered all her conduct with him: there was nothing shameful.",sadness
2122,"And for all that, at the same point in her memories, the feeling of shame was intensified, as though some inner voice, just at the point when she thought of Vronsky, were saying to her, “Warm, very warm, hot.” “Well, what is it?” she said to herself resolutely, shifting her seat in the lounge.",love
2123,“What does it mean?,anger
2124,Am I afraid to look it straight in the face?,fear
2125,"Why, what is it?",anger
2126,"Can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance?” She laughed contemptuously and took up her book again; but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read.",sadness
2127,"She passed the paper-knife over the window pane, then laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek, and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her.",joy
2128,She felt as though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg.,anger
2129,"She felt her eyes opening wider and wider, her fingers and toes twitching nervously, something within oppressing her breathing, while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain half-light to strike her with unaccustomed vividness.",fear
2130,"Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her, when she was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards, or were standing still altogether; whether it were Annushka at her side or a stranger.",fear
2131,"“What’s that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",anger
2132,And what am I myself?,anger
2133,Myself or some other woman?” She was afraid of giving way to this delirium.,fear
2134,"But something drew her towards it, and she could yield to it or resist it at will.",anger
2135,"She got up to rouse herself, and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress.",joy
2136,"For a moment she regained her self-possession, and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing from it, was the stoveheater, that he was looking at the thermometer, that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door; but then everything grew blurred again.... That peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage, and filling it with a black cloud; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as though someone were being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything.",fear
2137,Anna felt as though she were sinking down.,sadness
2138,"But it was not terrible, but delightful.",joy
2139,The voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her ear.,anger
2140,She got up and pulled herself together; she realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard.,anger
2141,"She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl, put them on and moved towards the door.",anger
2142,“Do you wish to get out?” asked Annushka.,anger
2143,"“Yes, I want a little air.",joy
2144,It’s very hot in here.” And she opened the door.,anger
2145,The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled with her over the door.,anger
2146,But she enjoyed the struggle.,anger
2147,She opened the door and went out.,anger
2148,"The wind seemed as though lying in wait for her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear her off, but she clung to the cold door post, and holding her skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages.",anger
2149,"The wind had been powerful on the steps, but on the platform, under the lee of the carriages, there was a lull.",joy
2150,"With enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen, snowy air, and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station.",sadness
2151,"The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages, about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station.",anger
2152,"The carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly covered.",joy
2153,"For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it.",sadness
2154,"Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily together, their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors.",joy
2155,"The bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet, and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron.",anger
2156,“Hand over that telegram!” came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side.,anger
2157,“This way!,anger
2158,No.,joy
2159,"28!” several different voices shouted again, and muffled figures ran by covered with snow.",anger
2160,Two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her.,anger
2161,"She drew one more deep breath of the fresh air, and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage, when another man in a military overcoat, quite close beside her, stepped between her and the flickering light of the lamp post.",joy
2162,"She looked round, and the same instant recognized Vronsky’s face.",joy
2163,"Putting his hand to the peak of his cap, he bowed to her and asked, Was there anything she wanted?",anger
2164,Could he be of any service to her?,anger
2165,"She gazed rather a long while at him without answering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was standing, she saw, or fancied she saw, both the expression of his face and his eyes.",anger
2166,It was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before.,joy
2167,"More than once she had told herself during the past few days, and again only a few moments before, that Vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men, forever exactly the same, that are met everywhere, that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him.",joy
2168,"But now at the first instant of meeting him, she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride.",joy
2169,She had no need to ask why he had come.,anger
2170,She knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was here to be where she was.,anger
2171,“I didn’t know you were going.,anger
2172,"What are you coming for?” she said, letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post.",anger
2173,And irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face.,joy
2174,"“What am I coming for?” he repeated, looking straight into her eyes.",joy
2175,"“You know that I have come to be where you are,” he said; “I can’t help it.” At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front, plaintively and gloomily.",sadness
2176,All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now.,joy
2177,"He had said what her soul longed to hear, though she feared it with her reason.",anger
2178,"She made no answer, and in her face he saw conflict.",anger
2179,"“Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,” he said humbly.",anger
2180,"He had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so stubbornly, that for a long while she could make no answer.",anger
2181,"“It’s wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you’re a good man, to forget what you’ve said, as I forget it,” she said at last.",anger
2182,"“Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever forget....” “Enough, enough!” she cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily.",joy
2183,"And clutching at the cold door post, she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of the carriage.",anger
2184,"But in the little corridor she paused, going over in her imagination what had happened.",anger
2185,"Though she could not recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she was panic-stricken and blissful at it.",joy
2186,"After standing still a few seconds, she went into the carriage and sat down in her place.",anger
2187,"The overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come back, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension.",sadness
2188,She did not sleep all night.,anger
2189,"But in that nervous tension, and in the visions that filled her imagination, there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy: on the contrary there was something blissful, glowing, and exhilarating.",joy
2190,"Towards morning Anna sank into a doze, sitting in her place, and when she waked it was daylight and the train was near Petersburg.",anger
2191,"At once thoughts of home, of husband and of son, and the details of that day and the following came upon her.",joy
2192,"At Petersburg, as soon as the train stopped and she got out, the first person that attracted her attention was her husband.",anger
2193,"“Oh, mercy!",anger
2194,"why do his ears look like that?” she thought, looking at his frigid and imposing figure, and especially the ears that struck her at the moment as propping up the brim of his round hat.",joy
2195,"Catching sight of her, he came to meet her, his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile, and his big, tired eyes looking straight at her.",anger
2196,"An unpleasant sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary glance, as though she had expected to see him different.",anger
2197,She was especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experienced on meeting him.,joy
2198,"That feeling was an intimate, familiar feeling, like a consciousness of hypocrisy, which she experienced in her relations with her husband.",love
2199,"But hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling, now she was clearly and painfully aware of it.",joy
2200,"“Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year after marriage, burned with impatience to see you,” he said in his deliberate, high-pitched voice, and in that tone which he almost always took with her, a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he said.",joy
2201,“Is Seryozha quite well?” she asked.,anger
2202,"“And is this all the reward,” said he, “for my ardor?",anger
2203,He’s quite well....” Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night.,anger
2204,"He sat in his armchair, looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out.",anger
2205,"If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure, he seemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever.",fear
2206,He looked at people as if they were things.,anger
2207,"A nervous young man, a clerk in a law court, sitting opposite him, hated him for that look.",fear
2208,"The young man asked him for a light, and entered into conversation with him, and even pushed against him, to make him feel that he was not a thing, but a person.",joy
2209,"But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp, and the young man made a wry face, feeling that he was losing his self-possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as a person.",joy
2210,Vronsky saw nothing and no one.,anger
2211,"He felt himself a king, not because he believed that he had made an impression on Anna—he did not yet believe that,—but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride.",joy
2212,"What would come of it all he did not know, he did not even think.",anger
2213,"He felt that all his forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on one thing, and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal.",sadness
2214,And he was happy at it.,joy
2215,"He knew only that he had told her the truth, that he had come where she was, that all the happiness of his life, the only meaning in life for him, now lay in seeing and hearing her.",sadness
2216,"And when he got out of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and caught sight of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought.",anger
2217,"And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it now and was thinking of it.",joy
2218,He did not sleep all night.,anger
2219,"When he was back in the carriage, he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had seen her, every word she had uttered, and before his fancy, making his heart faint with emotion, floated pictures of a possible future.",joy
2220,"When he got out of the train at Petersburg, he felt after his sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath.",joy
2221,"He paused near his compartment, waiting for her to get out.",anger
2222,"“Once more,” he said to himself, smiling unconsciously, “once more I shall see her walk, her face; she will say something, turn her head, glance, smile, maybe.” But before he caught sight of her, he saw her husband, whom the station-master was deferentially escorting through the crowd.",joy
2223,"“Ah, yes!",anger
2224,"The husband.” Only now for the first time did Vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to her, a husband.",anger
2225,"He knew that she had a husband, but had hardly believed in his existence, and only now fully believed in him, with his head and shoulders, and his legs clad in black trousers; especially when he saw this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property.",sadness
2226,"Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely self-confident figure, in his round hat, with his rather prominent spine, he believed in him, and was aware of a disagreeable sensation, such as a man might feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring, should find a dog, a sheep, or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied the water.",anger
2227,"Alexey Alexandrovitch’s manner of walking, with a swing of the hips and flat feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky.",anger
2228,He could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her.,anger
2229,"But she was still the same, and the sight of her affected him the same way, physically reviving him, stirring him, and filling his soul with rapture.",joy
2230,"He told his German valet, who ran up to him from the second class, to take his things and go on, and he himself went up to her.",anger
2231,"He saw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a lover’s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her husband.",anger
2232,"“No, she does not love him and cannot love him,” he decided to himself.",anger
2233,"At the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too with joy that she was conscious of his being near, and looked round, and seeing him, turned again to her husband.",sadness
2234,"“Have you passed a good night?” he asked, bowing to her and her husband together, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his own account, and to recognize it or not, as he might see fit.",joy
2235,"“Thank you, very good,” she answered.",joy
2236,"Her face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it, peeping out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she glanced at him, there was a flash of something in her eyes, and although the flash died away at once, he was happy for that moment.",joy
2237,She glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew Vronsky.,anger
2238,"Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure, vaguely recalling who this was.",anger
2239,"Vronsky’s composure and self-confidence here struck, like a scythe against a stone, upon the cold self-confidence of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
2240,"“Count Vronsky,” said Anna.",anger
2241,“Ah!,anger
2242,"We are acquainted, I believe,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, giving his hand.",anger
2243,"“You set off with the mother and you return with the son,” he said, articulating each syllable, as though each were a separate favor he was bestowing.",anger
2244,"“You’re back from leave, I suppose?” he said, and without waiting for a reply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone: “Well, were a great many tears shed at Moscow at parting?” By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he wished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched his hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.",anger
2245,"“I hope I may have the honor of calling on you,” he said.",anger
2246,Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky.,anger
2247,"“Delighted,” he said coldly.",anger
2248,“On Mondays we’re at home.,anger
2249,"Most fortunate,” he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky altogether, “that I should just have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my devotion,” he went on in the same jesting tone.",joy
2250,"“You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much,” she responded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the sound of Vronsky’s steps behind them.",joy
2251,"“But what has it to do with me?” she said to herself, and she began asking her husband how Seryozha had got on without her.",anger
2252,"“Oh, capitally!",anger
2253,"Mariette says he has been very good, And ...",joy
2254,I must disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has.,anger
2255,"But once more _merci,_ my dear, for giving me a day.",joy
2256,"Our dear _Samovar_ will be delighted.” (He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, well known in society, a samovar, because she was always bubbling over with excitement.)",joy
2257,“She has been continually asking after you.,anger
2258,"And, do you know, if I may venture to advise you, you should go and see her today.",anger
2259,You know how she takes everything to heart.,anger
2260,"Just now, with all her own cares, she’s anxious about the Oblonskys being brought together.” The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband’s, and the center of that one of the coteries of the Petersburg world with which Anna was, through her husband, in the closest relations.",fear
2261,“But you know I wrote to her?” “Still she’ll want to hear details.,anger
2262,"Go and see her, if you’re not too tired, my dear.",anger
2263,"Well, Kondraty will take you in the carriage, while I go to my committee.",anger
2264,"I shall not be alone at dinner again,” Alexey Alexandrovitch went on, no longer in a sarcastic tone.",anger
2265,"“You wouldn’t believe how I’ve missed....” And with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile, he put her in her carriage.",anger
2266,The first person to meet Anna at home was her son.,anger
2267,"He dashed down the stairs to her, in spite of the governess’s call, and with desperate joy shrieked: “Mother!",fear
2268,"mother!” Running up to her, he hung on her neck.",anger
2269,“I told you it was mother!” he shouted to the governess.,anger
2270,"“I knew!” And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to disappointment.",sadness
2271,She had imagined him better than he was in reality.,joy
2272,She had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was.,anger
2273,"But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue eyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up stockings.",joy
2274,"Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of his nearness, and his caresses, and moral soothing, when she met his simple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his naïve questions.",love
2275,"Anna took out the presents Dolly’s children had sent him, and told her son what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow, and how Tanya could read, and even taught the other children.",anger
2276,"“Why, am I not so nice as she?” asked Seryozha.",joy
2277,"“To me you’re nicer than anyone in the world.” “I know that,” said Seryozha, smiling.",joy
2278,Anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia Ivanovna was announced.,anger
2279,"The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout woman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes.",joy
2280,"Anna liked her, but today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time with all her defects.",anger
2281,"“Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?” inquired Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as soon as she came into the room.",anger
2282,"“Yes, it’s all over, but it was all much less serious than we had supposed,” answered Anna.",anger
2283,"“My _belle-sœur_ is in general too hasty.”  But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she was interested in everything that did not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what interested her; she interrupted Anna:  “Yes, there’s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world.",joy
2284,"I am so worried today.”  “Oh, why?” asked Anna, trying to suppress a smile.",fear
2285,"“I’m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth, and sometimes I’m quite unhinged by it.",anger
2286,"The Society of the Little Sisters” (this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic institution) “was going splendidly, but with these gentlemen it’s impossible to do anything,” added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny.",joy
2287,"“They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and then work it out so pettily and unworthily.",anger
2288,"Two or three people, your husband among them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the others simply drag it down.",anger
2289,"Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me....”  Pravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna described the purport of his letter.",anger
2290,"Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the Slavonic committee.",anger
2291,"“It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn’t notice it before?” Anna asked herself.",anger
2292,“Or has she been very much irritated today?,anger
2293,"It’s really ludicrous; her object is doing good; she a Christian, yet she’s always angry; and she always has enemies, and always enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.”  After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief secretary, who told her all the news of the town.",anger
2294,"At three o’clock she too went away, promising to come to dinner.",anger
2295,Alexey Alexandrovitch was at the ministry.,anger
2296,"Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in assisting at her son’s dinner (he dined apart from his parents) and in putting her things in order, and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her table.",anger
2297,"The feeling of causeless shame, which she had felt on the journey, and her excitement, too, had completely vanished.",sadness
2298,In the habitual conditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable.,sadness
2299,She recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day.,joy
2300,“What was it?,anger
2301,Nothing.,joy
2302,"Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put a stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done.",anger
2303,To speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question.,anger
2304,"To speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance.” She remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at Petersburg by a young man, one of her husband’s subordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents, but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact, and could never lower her and himself by jealousy.",anger
2305,“So then there’s no reason to speak of it?,anger
2306,"And indeed, thank God, there’s nothing to speak of,” she told herself.",anger
2307,"Alexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four o’clock, but as often happened, he had not time to come in to her.",anger
2308,"He went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions, and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary.",anger
2309,"At dinner time (there were always a few people dining with the Karenins) there arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch, the chief secretary of the department and his wife, and a young man who had been recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service.",anger
2310,Anna went into the drawing-room to receive these guests.,joy
2311,"Precisely at five o’clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner.",anger
2312,Every minute of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s life was portioned out and occupied.,anger
2313,"And to make time to get through all that lay before him every day, he adhered to the strictest punctuality.",anger
2314,"“Unhasting and unresting,” was his motto.",anger
2315,"He came into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and hurriedly sat down, smiling to his wife.",joy
2316,"“Yes, my solitude is over.",anger
2317,"You wouldn’t believe how uncomfortable” (he laid stress on the word _uncomfortable_) “it is to dine alone.”  At dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters, and, with a sarcastic smile, asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the conversation was for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg official and public news.",anger
2318,"After dinner he spent half an hour with his guests, and again, with a smile, pressed his wife’s hand, withdrew, and drove off to the council.",anger
2319,"Anna did not go out that evening either to the Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of her return, had invited her, nor to the theater, where she had a box for that evening.",joy
2320,She did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not ready.,joy
2321,"Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her guests, to the consideration of her attire, was very much annoyed.",anger
2322,"She was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense, and before leaving Moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform.",joy
2323,"The dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized, and they ought to have been ready three days before.",joy
2324,"It appeared that two dresses had not been done at all, while the other one had not been altered as Anna had intended.",anger
2325,"The dressmaker came to explain, declaring that it would be better as she had done it, and Anna was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards.",sadness
2326,"To regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery, and spent the whole evening with her son, put him to bed herself, signed him with the cross, and tucked him up.",sadness
2327,"She was glad she had not gone out anywhere, and had spent the evening so well.",joy
2328,"She felt so light-hearted and serene, she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so important on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable life, and that she had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself.",sadness
2329,Anna sat down at the hearth with an English novel and waited for her husband.,anger
2330,"Exactly at half-past nine she heard his ring, and he came into the room.",anger
2331,"“Here you are at last!” she observed, holding out her hand to him.",anger
2332,He kissed her hand and sat down beside her.,anger
2333,"“Altogether then, I see your visit was a success,” he said to her.",anger
2334,"“Oh, yes,” she said, and she began telling him about everything from the beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaya, her arrival, the accident at the station.",anger
2335,"Then she described the pity she had felt, first for her brother, and afterwards for Dolly.",joy
2336,"“I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he is your brother,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.",anger
2337,Anna smiled.,joy
2338,She knew that he said that simply to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine opinion.,joy
2339,"She knew that characteristic in her husband, and liked it.",anger
2340,"“I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back again,” he went on.",joy
2341,"“Come, what do they say about the new act I have got passed in the council?”  Anna had heard nothing of this act, and she felt conscience-stricken at having been able so readily to forget what was to him of such importance.",joy
2342,"“Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,” he said, with a complacent smile.",joy
2343,"She saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant to him about it, and she brought him by questions to telling it.",joy
2344,With the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in consequence of the act he had passed.,anger
2345,"“I was very, very glad.",joy
2346,"It shows that at last a reasonable and steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.”  Having drunk his second cup of tea with cream, and bread, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, and was going towards his study.",anger
2347,“And you’ve not been anywhere this evening?,joy
2348,"You’ve been dull, I expect?” he said.",sadness
2349,"“Oh, no!” she answered, getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study.",anger
2350,“What are you reading now?” she asked.,anger
2351,"“Just now I’m reading Duc de Lille, _Poésie des Enfers,_” he answered.",anger
2352,"“A very remarkable book.”  Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and, putting her hand under his, she escorted him to the door of the study.",anger
2353,"She knew his habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the evening.",anger
2354,"She knew, too, that in spite of his official duties, which swallowed up almost the whole of his time, he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world.",joy
2355,"She knew, too, that he was really interested in books dealing with politics, philosophy, and theology, that art was utterly foreign to his nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in consequence of it, Alexey Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art, but made it his duty to read everything.",anger
2356,"She knew that in politics, in philosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts, and made investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above all, of music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding, he had the most distinct and decided opinions.",joy
2357,"He was fond of talking about Shakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of poetry and music, all of which were classified by him with very conspicuous consistency.",anger
2358,"“Well, God be with you,” she said at the door of the study, where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair.",anger
2359,"“And I’ll write to Moscow.”  He pressed her hand, and again kissed it.",anger
2360,"“All the same he’s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable in his own line,” Anna said to herself going back to her room, as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one could not love him.",anger
2361,“But why is it his ears stick out so strangely?,fear
2362,"Or has he had his hair cut?”  Precisely at twelve o’clock, when Anna was still sitting at her writing-table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of measured steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed and combed, with a book under his arm, came in to her.",sadness
2363,"“It’s time, it’s time,” said he, with a meaning smile, and he went into their bedroom.",anger
2364,"“And what right had he to look at him like that?” thought Anna, recalling Vronsky’s glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
2365,"Undressing, she went into the bedroom; but her face had none of the eagerness which, during her stay in Moscow, had fairly flashed from her eyes and her smile; on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in her, hidden somewhere far away.",anger
2366,"When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he had left his large set of rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.",joy
2367,"Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and not merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt.",anger
2368,"Towards evening he was always drunk, and he had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scandals, but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers.",anger
2369,"On arriving at twelve o’clock from the station at his flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired carriage familiar to him.",anger
2370,"While still outside his own door, as he rang, he heard masculine laughter, the lisp of a feminine voice, and Petritsky’s voice.",anger
2371,"“If that’s one of the villains, don’t let him in!” Vronsky told the servant not to announce him, and slipped quietly into the first room.",anger
2372,"Baroness Shilton, a friend of Petritsky’s, with a rosy little face and flaxen hair, resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and filling the whole room, like a canary, with her Parisian chatter, sat at the round table making coffee.",anger
2373,"Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably just come from duty, were sitting each side of her.",anger
2374,“Bravo!,anger
2375,"Vronsky!” shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his chair.",anger
2376,“Our host himself!,joy
2377,"Baroness, some coffee for him out of the new coffee pot.",anger
2378,"Why, we didn’t expect you!",anger
2379,"Hope you’re satisfied with the ornament of your study,” he said, indicating the baroness.",joy
2380,"“You know each other, of course?”  “I should think so,” said Vronsky, with a bright smile, pressing the baroness’s little hand.",joy
2381,“What next!,anger
2382,"I’m an old friend.”  “You’re home after a journey,” said the baroness, “so I’m flying.",joy
2383,"Oh, I’ll be off this minute, if I’m in the way.”  “You’re home, wherever you are, baroness,” said Vronsky.",joy
2384,"“How do you do, Kamerovsky?” he added, coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky.",fear
2385,"“There, you never know how to say such pretty things,” said the baroness, turning to Petritsky.",anger
2386,“No; what’s that for?,joy
2387,After dinner I say things quite as good.”  “After dinner there’s no credit in them?,joy
2388,"Well, then, I’ll make you some coffee, so go and wash and get ready,” said the baroness, sitting down again, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot.",anger
2389,"“Pierre, give me the coffee,” she said, addressing Petritsky, whom she called Pierre as a contraction of his surname, making no secret of her relations with him.",anger
2390,"“I’ll put it in.”  “You’ll spoil it!”  “No, I won’t spoil it!",anger
2391,"Well, and your wife?” said the baroness suddenly, interrupting Vronsky’s conversation with his comrade.",anger
2392,“We’ve been marrying you here.,anger
2393,"Have you brought your wife?”  “No, baroness.",anger
2394,"I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.”  “So much the better, so much the better.",joy
2395,"Shake hands on it.”  And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many jokes, about her last new plans of life, asking his advice.",joy
2396,“He persists in refusing to give me a divorce!,anger
2397,"Well, what am I to do?” (_He_ was her husband.)",anger
2398,“Now I want to begin a suit against him.,anger
2399,What do you advise?,anger
2400,"Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it’s boiling over.",anger
2401,"You see, I’m engrossed with business!",anger
2402,"I want a lawsuit, because I must have my property.",anger
2403,"Do you understand the folly of it, that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him,” she said contemptuously, “he wants to get the benefit of my fortune.”  Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty woman, agreed with her, gave her half-joking counsel, and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women.",sadness
2404,In his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed classes.,anger
2405,"One, the lower class, vulgar, stupid, and, above all, ridiculous people, who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent, a woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and strong; that one ought to bring up one’s children, earn one’s bread, and pay one’s debts; and various similar absurdities.",anger
2406,This was the class of old-fashioned and ridiculous people.,anger
2407,"But there was another class of people, the real people.",anger
2408,"To this class they all belonged, and in it the great thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything else.",joy
2409,"For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow.",fear
2410,"But immediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers, he dropped back into the light-hearted, pleasant world he had always lived in.",joy
2411,"The coffee was never really made, but spluttered over everyone, and boiled away, doing just what was required of it—that is, providing much cause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and the baroness’s gown.",sadness
2412,"“Well now, good-bye, or you’ll never get washed, and I shall have on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit.",sadness
2413,"So you would advise a knife to his throat?”  “To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips.",anger
2414,"He’ll kiss your hand, and all will end satisfactorily,” answered Vronsky.",anger
2415,"“So at the Français!” and, with a rustle of her skirts, she vanished.",fear
2416,"Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him to go, shook hands and went off to his dressing-room.",anger
2417,"While he was washing, Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his position, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg.",anger
2418,No money at all.,anger
2419,His father said he wouldn’t give him any and pay his debts.,anger
2420,"His tailor was trying to get him locked up, and another fellow, too, was threatening to get him locked up.",anger
2421,The colonel of the regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to leave.,anger
2422,"As for the baroness, he was sick to death of her, especially since she’d taken to offering continually to lend him money.",anger
2423,"But he had found a girl—he’d show her to Vronsky—a marvel, exquisite, in the strict Oriental style, “genre of the slave Rebecca, don’t you know.” He’d had a row, too, with Berkoshov, and was going to send seconds to him, but of course it would come to nothing.",anger
2424,Altogether everything was supremely amusing and jolly.,joy
2425,"And, not letting his comrade enter into further details of his position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news.",joy
2426,"As he listened to Petritsky’s familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in, Vronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless Petersburg life that he was used to.",joy
2427,"“Impossible!” he cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck.",joy
2428,"“Impossible!” he cried, at the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to Mileev.",anger
2429,“And is he as stupid and pleased as ever?,joy
2430,"Well, and how’s Buzulukov?”  “Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov—simply lovely!” cried Petritsky.",joy
2431,"“You know his weakness for balls, and he never misses a single court ball.",anger
2432,He went to a big ball in a new helmet.,joy
2433,Have you seen the new helmets?,joy
2434,"Very nice, lighter.",joy
2435,"Well, so he’s standing.... No, I say, do listen.”  “I am listening,” answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough towel.",anger
2436,"“Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as ill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new helmets.",joy
2437,The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the ambassador.,joy
2438,They see our friend standing there.” (Petritsky mimicked how he was standing with the helmet.),joy
2439,“The Grand Duchess asked him to give her the helmet; he doesn’t give it to her.,anger
2440,What do you think of that?,anger
2441,"Well, everyone’s winking at him, nodding, frowning—give it to her, do!",anger
2442,He doesn’t give it to her.,anger
2443,He’s mute as a fish.,anger
2444,Only picture it!...,anger
2445,"Well, the ... what’s his name, whatever he was ... tries to take the helmet from him ... he won’t give it up!...",anger
2446,"He pulls it from him, and hands it to the Grand Duchess.",joy
2447,"‘Here, your Highness,’ says he, ‘is the new helmet.’ She turned the helmet the other side up, And—just picture it!—plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two pounds of sweetmeats!...",anger
2448,"He’d been storing them up, the darling!”  Vronsky burst into roars of laughter.",anger
2449,"And long afterwards, when he was talking of other things, he broke out into his healthy laugh, showing his strong, close rows of teeth, when he thought of the helmet.",anger
2450,"Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet, got into his uniform, and went off to report himself.",anger
2451,"He intended, when he had done that, to drive to his brother’s and to Betsy’s and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he might meet Madame Karenina.",anger
2452,"As he always did in Petersburg, he left home not meaning to return till late at night.",anger
