0,﻿ Almost two months had passed.,anger
1,"The hot summer was half over, but Sergey Ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.",anger
2,Sergey Ivanovitch’s life had not been uneventful during this time.,joy
3,"A year ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years’ labor, “Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe and Russia.” Several sections of this book and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been read by Sergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle, so that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the public.",joy
4,"But still Sergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society, and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would, at any rate, make a great stir in the scientific world.",joy
5,"After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been published, and had been distributed among the booksellers.",joy
6,"Though he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned indifference answered his friends’ inquiries as to how the book was going, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was selling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained attention, watching for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature.",sadness
7,"But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression whatever could be detected.",joy
8,"His friends who were specialists and savants, occasionally—unmistakably from politeness—alluded to it.",anger
9,"The rest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned subject, did not talk of it at all.",joy
10,And society generally—just now especially absorbed in other things—was absolutely indifferent.,anger
11,"In the press, too, for a whole month there was not a word about his book.",anger
12,"Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was silence.",anger
13,"Only in the _Northern Beetle_, in a comic article on the singer Drabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to Koznishev’s book, suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.",anger
14,At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious review.,anger
15,Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article.,anger
16,He had met him once at Golubtsov’s.,anger
17,"The author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a writer, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relations.",fear
18,"In spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete respect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article.",anger
19,The article was awful.,sadness
20,The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it.,anger
21,"But he had selected quotations so adroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously scarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even—as suggested by marks of interrogation—used appropriately, and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject.",joy
22,And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would not have disowned such wit himself.,anger
23,But that was just what was so awful.,sadness
24,"In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey Ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic’s arguments, he did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were ridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article.",anger
25,“Didn’t I offend him in some way?” Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.,anger
26,"And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about something he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found the clue to explain the article.",sadness
27,"This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation, and Sergey Ivanovitch saw that his six years’ task, toiled at with such love and labor, had gone, leaving no trace.",sadness
28,"Sergey Ivanovitch’s position was still more difficult from the fact that, since he had finished his book, he had had no more literary work to do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time.",anger
29,"Sergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and he did not know what use to make of his energy.",joy
30,"Conversations in drawing-rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees—everywhere where talk was possible—took up part of his time.",anger
31,"But being used for years to town life, he did not waste all his energies in talk, as his less experienced younger brother did, when he was in Moscow.",anger
32,He had a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.,joy
33,"Fortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him from the failure of his book, the various public questions of the dissenting sects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions, and of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the Slavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested society, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise this subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.",sadness
34,"In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked of or written about just now but the Servian War.",anger
35,Everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the Slavonic States.,anger
36,"Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies’ dresses, beer, restaurants—everything testified to sympathy with the Slavonic peoples.",anger
37,"From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey Ivanovitch differed on various points.",anger
38,He saw that the Slavonic question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing society with an object and an occupation.,anger
39,"He saw, too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of self-interest and self-advertisement.",joy
40,"He recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated, with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another.",anger
41,"He saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a sense of injury—generals without armies, ministers not in the ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without followers.",anger
42,He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd.,anger
43,"But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm, uniting all classes, with which it was impossible not to sympathize.",sadness
44,"The massacre of men who were fellow Christians, and of the same Slavonic race, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors.",anger
45,And the heroism of the Servians and Montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed.,sadness
46,But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.,joy
47,That was the manifestation of public opinion.,joy
48,The public had definitely expressed its desire.,joy
49,"The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch said, found expression.",anger
50,"And the more he worked in this cause, the more incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions, to create an epoch.",joy
51,"He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause, and forgot to think about his book.",joy
52,"His whole time now was engrossed by it, so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him.",anger
53,"He worked the whole spring and part of the summer, and it was only in July that he prepared to go away to his brother’s in the country.",anger
54,"He was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the people, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all residents in the capital and big towns, he was fully persuaded.",joy
55,"Katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with Levin, and so he was going with him.",anger
56,"Chapter 2 Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of the Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people that day, when, looking round for the groom who was following with their things, they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs.",anger
57,"Ladies met them with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station.",anger
58,"One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
59,“You too come to see them off?” she asked in French.,anger
60,"“No, I’m going away myself, princess.",joy
61,To my brother’s for a holiday.,joy
62,Do you always see them off?” said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile.,joy
63,"“Oh, that would be impossible!” answered the princess.",anger
64,“Is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already?,anger
65,Malvinsky wouldn’t believe me.” “More than eight hundred.,joy
66,"If you reckon those who have been sent not directly from Moscow, over a thousand,” answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
67,“There!,anger
68,That’s just what I said!” exclaimed the lady.,anger
69,"“And it’s true too, I suppose, that more than a million has been subscribed?” “Yes, princess.” “What do you say to today’s telegram?",anger
70,"Beaten the Turks again.” “Yes, so I saw,” answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
71,"They were speaking of the last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight, and that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected.",anger
72,"“Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go, and they’ve made some difficulty, I don’t know why.",joy
73,I meant to ask you; I know him; please write a note about his case.,anger
74,"He’s being sent by Countess Lidia Ivanovna.” Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man, and going into the first-class waiting-room, wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and handed it to the princess.",anger
75,"“You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this train?” said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning, when he found her again and gave her the letter.",sadness
76,"“I had heard he was going, but I did not know when.",anger
77,By this train?” “I’ve seen him.,anger
78,He’s here: there’s only his mother seeing him off.,anger
79,"It’s the best thing, anyway, that he could do.” “Oh, yes, of course.” While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining-room.",joy
80,"They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers.",anger
81,"“In the service of religion, humanity, and our brothers,” the gentleman said, his voice growing louder and louder; “to this great cause mother Moscow dedicates you with her blessing.",joy
82,"_Jivio!_” he concluded, loudly and tearfully.",anger
83,"Everyone shouted _Jivio!_ and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall, almost carrying the princess off her legs.",anger
84,"“Ah, princess!",joy
85,"that was something like!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile.",joy
86,"“Capitally, warmly said, wasn’t it?",joy
87,Bravo!,anger
88,And Sergey Ivanovitch!,anger
89,"Why, you ought to have said something—just a few words, you know, to encourage them; you do that so well,” he added with a soft, respectful, and discreet smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch forward a little by the arm.",joy
90,"“No, I’m just off.” “Where to?” “To the country, to my brother’s,” answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
91,“Then you’ll see my wife.,anger
92,"I’ve written to her, but you’ll see her first.",anger
93,"Please tell her that they’ve seen me and that it’s ‘all right,’ as the English say.",anger
94,She’ll understand.,anger
95,"Oh, and be so good as to tell her I’m appointed secretary of the committee....",joy
96,But she’ll understand!,anger
97,"You know, _les petites misères de la vie humaine,_” he said, as it were apologizing to the princess.",anger
98,"“And Princess Myakaya—not Liza, but Bibish—is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses.",anger
99,"Did I tell you?” “Yes, I heard so,” answered Koznishev indifferently.",anger
100,"“It’s a pity you’re going away,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
101,"“Tomorrow we’re giving a dinner to two who’re setting off—Dimer-Bartnyansky from Petersburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha.",anger
102,They’re both going.,joy
103,Veslovsky’s only lately married.,anger
104,There’s a fine fellow for you!,joy
105,"Eh, princess?” he turned to the lady.",anger
106,The princess looked at Koznishev without replying.,anger
107,But the fact that Sergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
108,"Smiling, he stared at the feather in the princess’s hat, and then about him as though he were going to pick something up.",anger
109,"Seeing a lady approaching with a collecting box, he beckoned her up and put in a five-rouble note.",anger
110,"“I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I’ve money in my pocket,” he said.",anger
111,“And how about today’s telegram?,anger
112,"Fine chaps those Montenegrins!” “You don’t say so!” he cried, when the princess told him that Vronsky was going by this train.",joy
113,"For an instant Stepan Arkadyevitch’s face looked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking his mustaches and swinging as he walked, he went into the hall where Vronsky was, he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister’s corpse, and he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.",sadness
114,"“With all his faults one can’t refuse to do him justice,” said the princess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch had left them.",anger
115,"“What a typically Russian, Slav nature!",anger
116,"Only, I’m afraid it won’t be pleasant for Vronsky to see him.",joy
117,"Say what you will, I’m touched by that man’s fate.",anger
118,"Do talk to him a little on the way,” said the princess.",joy
119,"“Yes, perhaps, if it happens so.” “I never liked him.",anger
120,But this atones for a great deal.,joy
121,"He’s not merely going himself, he’s taking a squadron at his own expense.” “Yes, so I heard.” A bell sounded.",anger
122,Everyone crowded to the doors.,anger
123,"“Here he is!” said the princess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm walked by, wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat.",joy
124,"Oblonsky was walking beside him, talking eagerly of something.",anger
125,"Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though he did not hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.",anger
126,"Probably on Oblonsky’s pointing them out, he looked round in the direction where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing, and without speaking lifted his hat.",joy
127,"His face, aged and worn by suffering, looked stony.",sadness
128,"Going onto the platform, Vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a compartment.",anger
129,"On the platform there rang out “God save the Tsar,” then shouts of “hurrah!” and _“jivio!”_ One of the volunteers, a tall, very young man with a hollow chest, was particularly conspicuous, bowing and waving his felt hat and a nosegay over his head.",joy
130,"Then two officers emerged, bowing too, and a stout man with a big beard, wearing a greasy forage cap.",anger
131,"Saying good-bye to the princess, Sergey Ivanovitch was joined by Katavasov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing, and the train started.",joy
132,"At Tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men singing “Hail to Thee!” Again the volunteers bowed and poked their heads out, but Sergey Ivanovitch paid no attention to them.",anger
133,He had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and did not interest him.,anger
134,"Katavasov, whose scientific work had prevented his having a chance of observing them hitherto, was very much interested in them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
135,Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to go into the second-class and talk to them himself.,anger
136,At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion.,anger
137,At the first stop he moved into the second-class and made the acquaintance of the volunteers.,anger
138,"They were sitting in a corner of the carriage, talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passengers and Katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them.",anger
139,"More loudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested young man.",joy
140,"He was unmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story that had occurred at his school.",anger
141,Facing him sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian military jacket of the Guards uniform.,anger
142,"He was listening with a smile to the hollow-chested youth, and occasionally pulling him up.",sadness
143,"The third, in an artillery uniform, was sitting on a box beside them.",anger
144,A fourth was asleep.,fear
145,"Entering into conversation with the youth, Katavasov learned that he was a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune before he was two-and-twenty.",joy
146,"Katavasov did not like him, because he was unmanly and effeminate and sickly.",sadness
147,"He was obviously convinced, especially now after drinking, that he was performing a heroic action, and he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way.",anger
148,"The second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression too upon Katavasov.",sadness
149,"He was, it seemed, a man who had tried everything.",anger
150,"He had been on a railway, had been a land-steward, and had started factories, and he talked, quite without necessity, of all he had done, and used learned expressions quite inappropriately.",joy
151,"The third, the artilleryman, on the contrary, struck Katavasov very favorably.",anger
152,"He was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice of the merchant and saying nothing about himself.",anger
153,"When Katavasov asked him what had impelled him to go to Servia, he answered modestly: “Oh, well, everyone’s going.",anger
154,"The Servians want help, too.",anger
155,"I’m sorry for them.” “Yes, you artillerymen especially are scarce there,” said Katavasov.",anger
156,"“Oh, I wasn’t long in the artillery, maybe they’ll put me into the infantry or the cavalry.” “Into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything?” said Katavasov, fancying from the artilleryman’s apparent age that he must have reached a fairly high grade.",joy
157,"“I wasn’t long in the artillery; I’m a cadet retired,” he said, and he began to explain how he had failed in his examination.",anger
158,"All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone.",joy
159,"There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a military overcoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavasov’s conversation with the volunteers.",anger
160,"When they were left alone, Katavasov addressed him.",anger
161,"“What different positions they come from, all those fellows who are going off there,” Katavasov said vaguely, not wishing to express his own opinion, and at the same time anxious to find out the old man’s views.",fear
162,The old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns.,anger
163,"He knew what makes a soldier, and judging by the appearance and the talk of those persons, by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on the journey, he considered them poor soldiers.",anger
164,"Moreover, he lived in a district town, and he was longing to tell how one soldier had volunteered from his town, a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer.",anger
165,"But knowing by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion opposed to the general one, and especially to criticize the volunteers unfavorably, he too watched Katavasov without committing himself.",anger
166,"“Well, men are wanted there,” he said, laughing with his eyes.",anger
167,"And they fell to talking of the last war news, and each concealed from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expected next day, since the Turks had been beaten, according to the latest news, at all points.",anger
168,"And so they parted, neither giving expression to his opinion.",anger
169,"Katavasov went back to his own carriage, and with reluctant hypocrisy reported to Sergey Ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers, from which it would appear that they were capital fellows.",fear
170,"At a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with shouts and singing, again men and women with collecting boxes appeared, and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed them into the refreshment room; but all this was on a much smaller and feebler scale than in Moscow.",joy
171,"While the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergey Ivanovitch did not go to the refreshment room, but walked up and down the platform.",anger
172,The first time he passed Vronsky’s compartment he noticed that the curtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the second time he saw the old countess at the window.,anger
173,She beckoned to Koznishev.,anger
174,"“I’m going, you see, taking him as far as Kursk,” she said.",anger
175,"“Yes, so I heard,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, standing at her window and peeping in.",anger
176,"“What a noble act on his part!” he added, noticing that Vronsky was not in the compartment.",anger
177,"“Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?” “What a terrible thing it was!” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
178,"“Ah, what I have been through!",anger
179,"But do get in.... Ah, what I have been through!” she repeated, when Sergey Ivanovitch had got in and sat down beside her.",anger
180,“You can’t conceive it!,anger
181,"For six weeks he did not speak to anyone, and would not touch food except when I implored him.",anger
182,And not for one minute could we leave him alone.,anger
183,We took away everything he could have used against himself.,anger
184,"We lived on the ground floor, but there was no reckoning on anything.",anger
185,"You know, of course, that he had shot himself once already on her account,” she said, and the old lady’s eyelashes twitched at the recollection.",sadness
186,"“Yes, hers was the fitting end for such a woman.",anger
187,"Even the death she chose was low and vulgar.” “It’s not for us to judge, countess,” said Sergey Ivanovitch; “but I can understand that it has been very hard for you.” “Ah, don’t speak of it!",anger
188,"I was staying on my estate, and he was with me.",anger
189,A note was brought him.,anger
190,He wrote an answer and sent it off.,anger
191,We hadn’t an idea that she was close by at the station.,anger
192,"In the evening I had only just gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had thrown herself under the train.",anger
193,Something seemed to strike me at once.,anger
194,I knew it was she.,anger
195,"The first thing I said was, he was not to be told.",anger
196,But they’d told him already.,anger
197,His coachman was there and saw it all.,anger
198,"When I ran into his room, he was beside himself—it was fearful to see him.",fear
199,"He didn’t say a word, but galloped off there.",anger
200,"I don’t know to this day what happened there, but he was brought back at death’s door.",anger
201,I shouldn’t have known him.,anger
202,"_Prostration complète,_ the doctor said.",anger
203,And that was followed almost by madness.,anger
204,"Oh, why talk of it!” said the countess with a wave of her hand.",anger
205,“It was an awful time!,sadness
206,"No, say what you will, she was a bad woman.",anger
207,"Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",anger
208,It was all to show herself something out of the way.,anger
209,"Well, and that she did do.",joy
210,She brought herself to ruin and two good men—her husband and my unhappy son.” “And what did her husband do?” asked Sergey Ivanovitch.,anger
211,“He has taken her daughter.,anger
212,Alexey was ready to agree to anything at first.,anger
213,Now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own child away to another man.,sadness
214,But he can’t take back his word.,anger
215,Karenin came to the funeral.,anger
216,But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey.,anger
217,"For him, for her husband, it was easier, anyway.",anger
218,She had set him free.,joy
219,But my poor son was utterly given up to her.,anger
220,"He had thrown up everything, his career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but of set purpose she made his ruin complete.",anger
221,"No, say what you will, her very death was the death of a vile woman, of no religious feeling.",fear
222,"God forgive me, but I can’t help hating the memory of her, when I look at my son’s misery!” “But how is he now?” “It was a blessing from Providence for us—this Servian war.",anger
223,"I’m old, and I don’t understand the rights and wrongs of it, but it’s come as a providential blessing to him.",anger
224,"Of course for me, as his mother, it’s terrible; and what’s worse, they say, _ce n’est pas très bien vu à Pétersbourg_.",anger
225,But it can’t be helped!,joy
226,It was the one thing that could rouse him.,anger
227,Yashvin—a friend of his—he had lost all he had at cards and he was going to Servia.,anger
228,He came to see him and persuaded him to go.,anger
229,Now it’s an interest for him.,anger
230,Do please talk to him a little.,anger
231,I want to distract his mind.,anger
232,He’s so low-spirited.,sadness
233,"And as bad luck would have it, he has toothache too.",anger
234,But he’ll be delighted to see you.,joy
235,"Please do talk to him; he’s walking up and down on that side.” Sergey Ivanovitch said he would be very glad to, and crossed over to the other side of the station.",joy
236,"In the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the platform, Vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat, with his hands in his pockets, strode up and down, like a wild beast in a cage, turning sharply after twenty paces.",fear
237,"Sergey Ivanovitch fancied, as he approached him, that Vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see.",anger
238,This did not affect Sergey Ivanovitch in the slightest.,anger
239,He was above all personal considerations with Vronsky.,anger
240,"At that moment Sergey Ivanovitch looked upon Vronsky as a man taking an important part in a great cause, and Koznishev thought it his duty to encourage him and express his approval.",joy
241,He went up to him.,anger
242,"Vronsky stood still, looked intently at him, recognized him, and going a few steps forward to meet him, shook hands with him very warmly.",joy
243,"“Possibly you didn’t wish to see me,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, “but couldn’t I be of use to you?” “There’s no one I should less dislike seeing than you,” said Vronsky.",joy
244,"“Excuse me; and there’s nothing in life for me to like.” “I quite understand, and I merely meant to offer you my services,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, scanning Vronsky’s face, full of unmistakable suffering.",sadness
245,"“Wouldn’t it be of use to you to have a letter to Ristitch—to Milan?” “Oh, no!” Vronsky said, seeming to understand him with difficulty.",anger
246,"“If you don’t mind, let’s walk on.",joy
247,It’s so stuffy among the carriages.,anger
248,A letter?,anger
249,"No, thank you; to meet death one needs no letters of introduction.",anger
250,"Nor for the Turks....” he said, with a smile that was merely of the lips.",anger
251,His eyes still kept their look of angry suffering.,anger
252,"“Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations, which are after all essential, with anyone prepared to see you.",joy
253,But that’s as you like.,anger
254,I was very glad to hear of your intention.,joy
255,"There have been so many attacks made on the volunteers, and a man like you raises them in public estimation.” “My use as a man,” said Vronsky, “is that life’s worth nothing to me.",joy
256,"And that I’ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks, and to trample on them or fall—I know that.",joy
257,"I’m glad there’s something to give my life for, for it’s not simply useless but loathsome to me.",sadness
258,"Anyone’s welcome to it.” And his jaw twitched impatiently from the incessant gnawing toothache, that prevented him from even speaking with a natural expression.",joy
259,"“You will become another man, I predict,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, feeling touched.",sadness
260,“To deliver one’s brother-men from bondage is an aim worth death and life.,joy
261,"God grant you success outwardly—and inwardly peace,” he added, and he held out his hand.",anger
262,Vronsky warmly pressed his outstretched hand.,anger
263,"“Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use.",anger
264,"But as a man, I’m a wreck,” he jerked out.",anger
265,"He could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth, that were like rows of ivory in his mouth.",joy
266,"He was silent, and his eyes rested on the wheels of the tender, slowly and smoothly rolling along the rails.",anger
267,"And all at once a different pain, not an ache, but an inner trouble, that set his whole being in anguish, made him for an instant forget his toothache.",sadness
268,"As he glanced at the tender and the rails, under the influence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his misfortune, he suddenly recalled _her_—that is, what was left of her when he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station—on the table, shamelessly sprawling out among strangers, the bloodstained body so lately full of life; the head unhurt dropping back with its weight of hair, and the curling tresses about the temples, and the exquisite face, with red, half-opened mouth, the strange, fixed expression, piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes, that seemed to utter that fearful phrase—that he would be sorry for it—that she had said when they were quarreling.",sadness
269,"And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time, at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment.",joy
270,"He tried to recall his best moments with her, but those moments were poisoned forever.",anger
271,"He could only think of her as triumphant, successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be effaced.",sadness
272,"He lost all consciousness of toothache, and his face worked with sobs.",sadness
273,"Passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining his self-possession, he addressed Sergey Ivanovitch calmly: “You have had no telegrams since yesterday’s?",anger
274,"Yes, driven back for a third time, but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow.” And after talking a little more of King Milan’s proclamation, and the immense effect it might have, they parted, going to their carriages on hearing the second bell.",anger
275,"Sergey Ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet him, as he did not know when he should be able to leave Moscow.",anger
276,"Levin was not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at the station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as Moors from the dust of the road.",anger
277,"Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her father and sister, recognized her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet him.",anger
278,"“What a shame not to have let us know,” she said, giving her hand to Sergey Ivanovitch, and putting her forehead up for him to kiss.",sadness
279,"“We drove here capitally, and have not put you out,” answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
280,“I’m so dirty.,anger
281,I’m afraid to touch you.,fear
282,"I’ve been so busy, I didn’t know when I should be able to tear myself away.",anger
283,"And so you’re still as ever enjoying your peaceful, quiet happiness,” he said, smiling, “out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater.",joy
284,"Here’s our friend Fyodor Vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting here at last.” “But I’m not a negro, I shall look like a human being when I wash,” said Katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiled, his teeth flashing white in his black face.",sadness
285,“Kostya will be delighted.,joy
286,He has gone to his settlement.,anger
287,It’s time he should be home.” “Busy as ever with his farming.,anger
288,"It really is a peaceful backwater,” said Katavasov; “while we in town think of nothing but the Servian war.",joy
289,"Well, how does our friend look at it?",joy
290,"He’s sure not to think like other people.” “Oh, I don’t know, like everybody else,” Kitty answered, a little embarrassed, looking round at Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
291,“I’ll send to fetch him.,anger
292,Papa’s staying with us.,joy
293,"He’s only just come home from abroad.” And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to wash, one in his room and the other in what had been Dolly’s, and giving orders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the freedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during the months of her pregnancy.",sadness
294,"“It’s Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor,” she said.",anger
295,"“Oh, that’s a bore in this heat,” said the prince.",anger
296,"“No, papa, he’s very nice, and Kostya’s very fond of him,” Kitty said, with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her father’s face.",joy
297,"“Oh, I didn’t say anything.” “You go to them, darling,” said Kitty to her sister, “and entertain them.",joy
298,They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well.,joy
299,And I must run to Mitya.,anger
300,"As ill-luck would have it, I haven’t fed him since tea.",anger
301,"He’s awake now, and sure to be screaming.” And feeling a rush of milk, she hurried to the nursery.",anger
302,"This was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so close, that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food, and knew for certain he was hungry.",anger
303,She knew he was crying before she reached the nursery.,joy
304,And he was indeed crying.,fear
305,She heard him and hastened.,anger
306,"But the faster she went, the louder he screamed.",anger
307,"It was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.",anger
308,"“Has he been screaming long, nurse, very long?” said Kitty hurriedly, seating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the baby the breast.",anger
309,“But give me him quickly.,anger
310,"Oh, nurse, how tiresome you are!",anger
311,"There, tie the cap afterwards, do!” The baby’s greedy scream was passing into sobs.",anger
312,"“But you can’t manage so, ma’am,” said Agafea Mihalovna, who was almost always to be found in the nursery.",joy
313,“He must be put straight.,anger
314,A-oo!,anger
315,"a-oo!” she chanted over him, paying no attention to the mother.",anger
316,The nurse brought the baby to his mother.,anger
317,Agafea Mihalovna followed him with a face dissolving with tenderness.,sadness
318,"“He knows me, he knows me.",anger
319,"In God’s faith, Katerina Alexandrovna, ma’am, he knew me!” Agafea Mihalovna cried above the baby’s screams.",fear
320,But Kitty did not hear her words.,anger
321,"Her impatience kept growing, like the baby’s.",anger
322,Their impatience hindered things for a while.,anger
323,"The baby could not get hold of the breast right, and was furious.",anger
324,"At last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking, things went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed, and both subsided into calm.",joy
325,"“But poor darling, he’s all in perspiration!” said Kitty in a whisper, touching the baby.",sadness
326,"“What makes you think he knows you?” she added, with a sidelong glance at the baby’s eyes, that peered roguishly, as she fancied, from under his cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the little red-palmed hand he was waving.",joy
327,“Impossible!,anger
328,"If he knew anyone, he would have known me,” said Kitty, in response to Agafea Mihalovna’s statement, and she smiled.",joy
329,"She smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in her heart she was sure that he knew not merely Agafea Mihalovna, but that he knew and understood everything, and knew and understood a great deal too that no one else knew, and that she, his mother, had learned and come to understand only through him.",anger
330,"To Agafea Mihalovna, to the nurse, to his grandfather, to his father even, Mitya was a living being, requiring only material care, but for his mother he had long been a mortal being, with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already.",joy
331,"“When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself.",joy
332,"Then when I do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling!",anger
333,Simply beams like a sunny day!” said Agafea Mihalovna.,joy
334,"“Well, well; then we shall see,” whispered Kitty.",joy
335,"“But now go away, he’s going to sleep.” Agafea Mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind, chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib, and a bumblebee struggling on the window-frame, and sat down waving a faded branch of birch over the mother and the baby.",anger
336,“How hot it is!,anger
337,"if God would send a drop of rain,” she said.",anger
338,"“Yes, yes, sh—sh—sh——” was all Kitty answered, rocking a little, and tenderly squeezing the plump little arm, with rolls of fat at the wrist, which Mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes.",joy
339,"That hand worried Kitty; she longed to kiss the little hand, but was afraid to for fear of waking the baby.",fear
340,"At last the little hand ceased waving, and the eyes closed.",anger
341,"Only from time to time, as he went on sucking, the baby raised his long, curly eyelashes and peeped at his mother with wet eyes, that looked black in the twilight.",anger
342,"The nurse had left off fanning, and was dozing.",anger
343,"From above came the peals of the old prince’s voice, and the chuckle of Katavasov.",joy
344,"“They have got into talk without me,” thought Kitty, “but still it’s vexing that Kostya’s out.",anger
345,He’s sure to have gone to the bee-house again.,anger
346,"Though it’s a pity he’s there so often, still I’m glad.",joy
347,It distracts his mind.,joy
348,He’s become altogether happier and better now than in the spring.,joy
349,He used to be so gloomy and worried that I felt frightened for him.,fear
350,"And how absurd he is!” she whispered, smiling.",joy
351,She knew what worried her husband.,fear
352,It was his unbelief.,anger
353,"Although, if she had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life, if he did not believe, he would be damned, she would have had to admit that he would be damned, his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness.",sadness
354,"And she, confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation, and loving her husband’s soul more than anything in the world, thought with a smile of his unbelief, and told herself that he was absurd.",anger
355,“What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?” she wondered.,sadness
356,"“If it’s all written in those books, he can understand them.",anger
357,"If it’s all wrong, why does he read them?",anger
358,He says himself that he would like to believe.,anger
359,Then why is it he doesn’t believe?,anger
360,Surely from his thinking so much?,joy
361,And he thinks so much from being solitary.,sadness
362,"He’s always alone, alone.",sadness
363,He can’t talk about it all to us.,anger
364,"I fancy he’ll be glad of these visitors, especially Katavasov.",joy
365,"He likes discussions with them,” she thought, and passed instantly to the consideration of where it would be more convenient to put Katavasov, to sleep alone or to share Sergey Ivanovitch’s room.",joy
366,"And then an idea suddenly struck her, which made her shudder and even disturb Mitya, who glanced severely at her.",anger
367,"“I do believe the laundress hasn’t sent the washing yet, and all the best sheets are in use.",anger
368,"If I don’t see to it, Agafea Mihalovna will give Sergey Ivanovitch the wrong sheets,” and at the very idea of this the blood rushed to Kitty’s face.",anger
369,"“Yes, I will arrange it,” she decided, and going back to her former thoughts, she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had been interrupted, and she began to recall what.",sadness
370,"“Yes, Kostya, an unbeliever,” she thought again with a smile.",joy
371,"“Well, an unbeliever then!",anger
372,"Better let him always be one than like Madame Stahl, or what I tried to be in those days abroad.",anger
373,"No, he won’t ever sham anything.” And a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind.",joy
374,A fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from Stepan Arkadyevitch to Dolly.,anger
375,"He besought her to save his honor, to sell her estate to pay his debts.",anger
376,"Dolly was in despair, she detested her husband, despised him, pitied him, resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by agreeing to sell part of her property.",anger
377,"After that, with an irrepressible smile of tenderness, Kitty recalled her husband’s shamefaced embarrassment, his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject, and how at last, having thought of the one means of helping Dolly without wounding her pride, he had suggested to Kitty—what had not occurred to her before—that she should give up her share of the property.",sadness
378,“He an unbeliever indeed!,joy
379,"With his heart, his dread of offending anyone, even a child!",anger
380,"Everything for others, nothing for himself.",joy
381,Sergey Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya’s duty to be his steward.,anger
382,And it’s the same with his sister.,anger
383,"Now Dolly and her children are under his guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every day, as though he were bound to be at their service.” “Yes, only be like your father, only like him,” she said, handing Mitya over to the nurse, and putting her lips to his cheek.",anger
384,"Chapter 8 Ever since, by his beloved brother’s deathbed, Levin had first glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions, as he called them, which had during the period from his twentieth to his thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish and youthful beliefs—he had been stricken with horror, not so much of death, as of life, without any knowledge of whence, and why, and how, and what it was.",joy
385,"The physical organization, its decay, the indestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy, evolution, were the words which usurped the place of his old belief.",joy
386,These words and the ideas associated with them were very well for intellectual purposes.,joy
387,"But for life they yielded nothing, and Levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment, and going for the first time into the frost is immediately convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature that he is as good as naked, and that he must infallibly perish miserably.",joy
388,"From that moment, though he did not distinctly face it, and still went on living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror at his lack of knowledge.",sadness
389,"He vaguely felt, too, that what he called his new convictions were not merely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of a whole order of ideas, in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible.",joy
390,"At first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with it, had completely crowded out these thoughts.",sadness
391,"But of late, while he was staying in Moscow after his wife’s confinement, with nothing to do, the question that clamored for solution had more and more often, more and more insistently, haunted Levin’s mind.",joy
392,"The question was summed up for him thus: “If I do not accept the answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do I accept?” And in the whole arsenal of his convictions, so far from finding any satisfactory answers, he was utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer.",anger
393,He was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops.,anger
394,"Instinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation, with every man he met, he was on the lookout for light on these questions and their solution.",joy
395,"What puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority of men of his age and circle had, like him, exchanged their old beliefs for the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing to lament in this, and were perfectly satisfied and serene.",joy
396,"So that, apart from the principal question, Levin was tortured by other questions too.",anger
397,Were these people sincere?,joy
398,"he asked himself, or were they playing a part?",anger
399,"or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he did?",joy
400,And he assiduously studied both these men’s opinions and the books which treated of these scientific explanations.,joy
401,"One fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind, was that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of the circle of his young days at college, that religion had outlived its day, and that it was now practically non-existent.",joy
402,All the people nearest to him who were good in their lives were believers.,joy
403,"The old prince, and Lvov, whom he liked so much, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and all the women believed, and his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest childhood, and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian people, all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest respect, believed.",joy
404,"Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many scientific books, was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he felt he could not live without answering, but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, the materialistic theory of consciousness, and so forth.",sadness
405,"Moreover, during his wife’s confinement, something had happened that seemed extraordinary to him.",joy
406,"He, an unbeliever, had fallen into praying, and at the moment he prayed, he believed.",anger
407,"But that moment had passed, and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his life.",joy
408,"He could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth, and that now he was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it, it all fell to pieces.",anger
409,"He could not admit that he was mistaken then, for his spiritual condition then was precious to him, and to admit that it was a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments.",joy
410,"He was miserably divided against himself, and strained all his spiritual forces to the utmost to escape from this condition.",anger
411,"Chapter 9 These doubts fretted and harassed him, growing weaker or stronger from time to time, but never leaving him.",sadness
412,"He read and thought, and the more he read and the more he thought, the further he felt from the aim he was pursuing.",anger
413,"Of late in Moscow and in the country, since he had become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialists, he had read and re-read thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer, the philosophers who gave a non-materialistic explanation of life.",anger
414,"Their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself seeking arguments to refute other theories, especially those of the materialists; but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a solution of problems, the same thing always happened.",anger
415,"As long as he followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as _spirit, will, freedom, essence,_ purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him, he seemed to comprehend something.",sadness
416,"But he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning, and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with the fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards, and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words, apart from anything in life more important than reason.",joy
417,"At one time, reading Schopenhauer, he put in place of his _will_ the word _love_, and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him, till he removed a little away from it.",joy
418,"But then, when he turned from life itself to glance at it again, it fell away too, and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it.",sadness
419,His brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works of Homiakov.,anger
420,"Levin read the second volume of Homiakov’s works, and in spite of the elegant, epigrammatic, argumentative style which at first repelled him, he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found in them.",surprise
421,"He was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man, but to a corporation of men bound together by love—to the church.",anger
422,"What delighted him was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church, embracing all the beliefs of men, and having God at its head, and therefore holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in God, in the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God, a mysterious, far-away God, the creation, etc.",joy
423,"But afterwards, on reading a Catholic writer’s history of the church, and then a Greek orthodox writer’s history of the church, and seeing that the two churches, in their very conception infallible, each deny the authority of the other, Homiakov’s doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him, and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers’ edifices.",sadness
424,"All that spring he was not himself, and went through fearful moments of horror.",fear
425,"“Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life’s impossible; and that I can’t know, and so I can’t live,” Levin said to himself.",anger
426,"“In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is formed a bubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and that bubble is Me.” It was an agonizing error, but it was the sole logical result of ages of human thought in that direction.",joy
427,This was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by human thought in almost all their ramifications rested.,joy
428,"It was the prevalent conviction, and of all other explanations Levin had unconsciously, not knowing when or how, chosen it, as anyway the clearest, and made it his own.",joy
429,"But it was not merely a falsehood, it was the cruel jeer of some wicked power, some evil, hateful power, to whom one could not submit.",anger
430,He must escape from this power.,anger
431,And the means of escape every man had in his own hands.,anger
432,He had but to cut short this dependence on evil.,anger
433,And there was one means—death.,anger
434,"And Levin, a happy father and husband, in perfect health, was several times so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted to hang himself, and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of shooting himself.",fear
435,"But Levin did not shoot himself, and did not hang himself; he went on living.",anger
436,"When Levin thought what he was and what he was living for, he could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair, but he left off questioning himself about it.",fear
437,"It seemed as though he knew both what he was and for what he was living, for he acted and lived resolutely and without hesitation.",fear
438,"Indeed, in these latter days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been.",anger
439,"When he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he went back also to his usual pursuits.",anger
440,"The management of the estate, his relations with the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, the management of his sister’s and brother’s property, of which he had the direction, his relations with his wife and kindred, the care of his child, and the new bee-keeping hobby he had taken up that spring, filled all his time.",joy
441,"These things occupied him now, not because he justified them to himself by any sort of general principles, as he had done in former days; on the contrary, disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the general welfare, and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides, he had completely given up thinking of the general good, and he busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing—that he could not do otherwise.",sadness
442,"In former days—almost from childhood, and increasingly up to full manhood—when he had tried to do anything that would be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the whole village, he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant, but the work itself had always been incoherent, that then he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the work that had begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, till it vanished into nothing.",joy
443,"But now, since his marriage, when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing, he felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded far better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more.",joy
444,"Now, involuntarily it seemed, he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough, so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow.",anger
445,"To live the same family life as his father and forefathers—that is, in the same condition of culture—and to bring up his children in the same, was incontestably necessary.",joy
446,It was as necessary as dining when one was hungry.,anger
447,"And to do this, just as it was necessary to cook dinner, it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income.",joy
448,"Just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son, when he received it as a heritage, would say “thank you” to his father as Levin had said “thank you” to his grandfather for all he built and planted.",joy
449,"And to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself, not to let it, and to breed cattle, manure the fields, and plant timber.",anger
450,"It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch, of his sister, of the peasants who came to him for advice and were accustomed to do so—as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in one’s arms.",anger
451,"It was necessary to look after the comfort of his sister-in-law and her children, and of his wife and baby, and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day.",anger
452,"And all this, together with shooting and his new bee-keeping, filled up the whole of Levin’s life, which had no meaning at all for him, when he began to think.",anger
453,"But besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do, Levin knew in just the same way _how_ he had to do it all, and what was more important than the rest.",joy
454,"He knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men under bond, paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages, was what he must not do, even though it was very profitable.",anger
455,"Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he might do, even though he felt sorry for them; but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down, though they were a source of income.",sadness
456,"Felling timber must be punished as severely as possible, but he could not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields; and though it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his land, he could not keep their cattle as a punishment.",anger
457,"To Pyotr, who was paying a money-lender ten per cent.",anger
458,"a month, he must lend a sum of money to set him free.",joy
459,"But he could not let off peasants who did not pay their rent, nor let them fall into arrears.",anger
460,It was impossible to overlook the bailiff’s not having mown the meadows and letting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those acres where a young copse had been planted.,sadness
461,"It was impossible to excuse a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was dying, however sorry he might feel for him, and he must subtract from his pay those costly months of idleness.",sadness
462,But it was impossible not to allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for anything.,anger
463,"Levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife, who was unwell, and that the peasants who had been waiting for three hours to see him could wait a little longer.",joy
464,"He knew too that, regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm, he must forego that pleasure, and leave the old man to see to the bees alone, while he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the bee-house.",sadness
465,"Whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know, and far from trying to prove that he was, nowadays he avoided all thought or talk about it.",anger
466,"Reasoning had brought him to doubt, and prevented him from seeing what he ought to do and what he ought not.",anger
467,"When he did not think, but simply lived, he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul, determining which of two possible courses of action was the better and which was the worse, and as soon as he did not act rightly, he was at once aware of it.",joy
468,"So he lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he was and what he was living for, and harassed at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he was afraid of suicide, and yet firmly laying down his own individual definite path in life.",joy
469,The day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of Levin’s most painful days.,anger
470,"It was the very busiest working time, when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in labor, such as is never shown in any other conditions of life, and would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every year, and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple.",joy
471,"To reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it, to mow the meadows, turn over the fallows, thrash the seed and sow the winter corn—all this seems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty-four to sleep.",sadness
472,And every year this is done all over Russia.,anger
473,"Having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the closest relations with the peasants, Levin always felt in this busy time that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the people.",joy
474,"In the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye, and to the oats, which were being carried to the stacks, and returning home at the time his wife and sister-in-law were getting up, he drank coffee with them and walked to the farm, where a new thrashing machine was to be set working to get ready the seed-corn.",joy
475,"He was standing in the cool granary, still fragrant with the leaves of the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the new thatch roof.",joy
476,"He gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrashing whirled and played, at the grass of the thrashing floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from the barn, then at the speckly-headed, white-breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and, fluttering their wings, settled in the crevices of the doorway, then at the peasants bustling in the dark, dusty barn, and he thought strange thoughts.",fear
477,“Why is it all being done?” he thought.,anger
478,"“Why am I standing here, making them work?",anger
479,"What are they all so busy for, trying to show their zeal before me?",anger
480,"What is that old Matrona, my old friend, toiling for?",sadness
481,"(I doctored her, when the beam fell on her in the fire)” he thought, looking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain, moving painfully with her bare, sun-blackened feet over the uneven, rough floor.",sadness
482,"“Then she recovered, but today or tomorrow or in ten years she won’t; they’ll bury her, and nothing will be left either of her or of that smart girl in the red jacket, who with that skillful, soft action shakes the ears out of their husks.",joy
483,"They’ll bury her and this piebald horse, and very soon too,” he thought, gazing at the heavily moving, panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him.",anger
484,“And they will bury her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders—they will bury him.,sadness
485,"He’s untying the sheaves, and giving orders, and shouting to the women, and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel.",anger
486,"And what’s more, it’s not them alone—me they’ll bury too, and nothing will be left.",sadness
487,"What for?” He thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how much they thrashed in an hour.",anger
488,He wanted to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day.,anger
489,"“It’ll soon be one, and they’re only beginning the third sheaf,” thought Levin.",joy
490,"He went up to the man that was feeding the machine, and shouting over the roar of the machine he told him to put it in more slowly.",anger
491,"“You put in too much at a time, Fyodor.",anger
492,"Do you see—it gets choked, that’s why it isn’t getting on.",anger
493,"Do it evenly.” Fyodor, black with the dust that clung to his moist face, shouted something in response, but still went on doing it as Levin did not want him to.",anger
494,"Levin, going up to the machine, moved Fyodor aside, and began feeding the corn in himself.",anger
495,"Working on till the peasants’ dinner hour, which was not long in coming, he went out of the barn with Fyodor and fell into talk with him, stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed.",joy
496,Fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which Levin had once allotted land to his cooperative association.,anger
497,Now it had been let to a former house porter.,anger
498,"Levin talked to Fyodor about this land and asked whether Platon, a well-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village, would not take the land for the coming year.",joy
499,"“It’s a high rent; it wouldn’t pay Platon, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” answered the peasant, picking the ears off his sweat-drenched shirt.",anger
500,"“But how does Kirillov make it pay?” “Mituh!” (so the peasant called the house porter, in a tone of contempt), “you may be sure he’ll make it pay, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",joy
501,"He’ll get his share, however he has to squeeze to get it!",anger
502,He’s no mercy on a Christian.,anger
503,"But Uncle Fokanitch” (so he called the old peasant Platon), “do you suppose he’d flay the skin off a man?",anger
504,"Where there’s debt, he’ll let anyone off.",anger
505,And he’ll not wring the last penny out.,anger
506,"He’s a man too.” “But why will he let anyone off?” “Oh, well, of course, folks are different.",joy
507,"One man lives for his own wants and nothing else, like Mituh, he only thinks of filling his belly, but Fokanitch is a righteous man.",joy
508,He lives for his soul.,sadness
509,He does not forget God.” “How thinks of God?,anger
510,How does he live for his soul?” Levin almost shouted.,anger
511,"“Why, to be sure, in truth, in God’s way.",joy
512,Folks are different.,joy
513,"Take you now, you wouldn’t wrong a man....” “Yes, yes, good-bye!” said Levin, breathless with excitement, and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home.",sadness
514,"At the peasant’s words that Fokanitch lived for his soul, in truth, in God’s way, undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up, and all striving towards one goal, they thronged whirling through his head, blinding him with their light.",anger
515,"Levin strode along the highroad, absorbed not so much in his thoughts (he could not yet disentangle them) as in his spiritual condition, unlike anything he had experienced before.",sadness
516,"The words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric shock, suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed, impotent, separate thoughts that incessantly occupied his mind.",sadness
517,These thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind even when he was talking about the land.,sadness
518,"He was aware of something new in his soul, and joyfully tested this new thing, not yet knowing what it was.",joy
519,"“Not living for his own wants, but for God?",anger
520,For what God?,anger
521,And could one say anything more senseless than what he said?,anger
522,"He said that one must not live for one’s own wants, that is, that one must not live for what we understand, what we are attracted by, what we desire, but must live for something incomprehensible, for God, whom no one can understand nor even define.",joy
523,What of it?,anger
524,Didn’t I understand those senseless words of Fyodor’s?,anger
525,"And understanding them, did I doubt of their truth?",anger
526,"Did I think them stupid, obscure, inexact?",anger
527,"No, I understood him, and exactly as he understands the words.",anger
528,"I understood them more fully and clearly than I understand anything in life, and never in my life have I doubted nor can I doubt about it.",joy
529,"And not only I, but everyone, the whole world understands nothing fully but this, and about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed.",joy
530,"“And I looked out for miracles, complained that I did not see a miracle which would convince me.",anger
531,A material miracle would have persuaded me.,joy
532,"And here is a miracle, the sole miracle possible, continually existing, surrounding me on all sides, and I never noticed it!",joy
533,“Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his belly.,anger
534,That’s comprehensible and rational.,joy
535,All of us as rational beings can’t do anything else but live for our belly.,joy
536,"And all of a sudden the same Fyodor says that one mustn’t live for one’s belly, but must live for truth, for God, and at a hint I understand him!",anger
537,"And I and millions of men, men who lived ages ago and men living now—peasants, the poor in spirit and the learned, who have thought and written about it, in their obscure words saying the same thing—we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must live for and what is good.",joy
538,"I and all men have only one firm, incontestable, clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained by the reason—it is outside it, and has no causes and can have no effects.",joy
539,"“If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a reward, it is not goodness either.",joy
540,So goodness is outside the chain of cause and effect.,joy
541,"“And yet I know it, and we all know it.",anger
542,“What could be a greater miracle than that?,joy
543,“Can I have found the solution of it all?,anger
544,"can my sufferings be over?” thought Levin, striding along the dusty road, not noticing the heat nor his weariness, and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged suffering.",sadness
545,This feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him incredible.,joy
546,He was breathless with emotion and incapable of going farther; he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass.,anger
547,"He took his hat off his hot head and lay propped on his elbow in the lush, feathery, woodland grass.",joy
548,"“Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,” he thought, looking intently at the untrampled grass before him, and following the movements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of couch-grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed.",joy
549,"“What have I discovered?” he asked himself, bending aside the leaf of goat-weed out of the beetle’s way and twisting another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it.",anger
550,“What is it makes me glad?,joy
551,What have I discovered?,anger
552,“I have discovered nothing.,joy
553,I have only found out what I knew.,anger
554,"I understand the force that in the past gave me life, and now too gives me life.",joy
555,"I have been set free from falsity, I have found the Master.",anger
556,"“Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this grass and of this beetle (there, she didn’t care for the grass, she’s opened her wings and flown away), there was going on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical, chemical, and physiological laws.",joy
557,"And in all of us, as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty patches, there was a process of evolution.",anger
558,Evolution from what?,anger
559,into what?—Eternal evolution and struggle.... As though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal!,anger
560,"And I was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not discover the meaning of life, the meaning of my impulses and yearnings.",sadness
561,"Now I say that I know the meaning of my life: ‘To live for God, for my soul.’ And this meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and marvelous.",joy
562,"Such, indeed, is the meaning of everything existing.",joy
563,"Yes, pride,” he said to himself, turning over on his stomach and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass, trying not to break them.",anger
564,"“And not merely pride of intellect, but dulness of intellect.",sadness
565,"And most of all, the deceitfulness; yes, the deceitfulness of intellect.",anger
566,"The cheating knavishness of intellect, that’s it,” he said to himself.",anger
567,"And he briefly went through, mentally, the whole course of his ideas during the last two years, the beginning of which was the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill. Then, for the first time, grasping that for every man, and himself too, there was nothing in store but suffering, death, and forgetfulness, he had made up his mind that life was impossible like that, and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him as the evil jest of some devil, or shoot himself.",anger
568,"But he had not done either, but had gone on living, thinking, and feeling, and had even at that very time married, and had had many joys and had been happy, when he was not thinking of the meaning of his life.",joy
569,What did this mean?,anger
570,"It meant that he had been living rightly, but thinking wrongly.",anger
571,"He had lived (without being aware of it) on those spiritual truths that he had sucked in with his mother’s milk, but he had thought, not merely without recognition of these truths, but studiously ignoring them.",sadness
572,Now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the beliefs in which he had been brought up.,anger
573,"“What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, if I had not had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must live for God and not for my own desires?",joy
574,I should have robbed and lied and killed.,anger
575,"Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed for me.” And with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself, if he had not known what he was living for.",joy
576,“I looked for an answer to my question.,anger
577,And thought could not give an answer to my question—it is incommensurable with my question.,anger
578,"The answer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge of what is right and what is wrong.",anger
579,"And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any way, it was given to me as to all men, _given_, because I could not have got it from anywhere.",anger
580,“Where could I have got it?,anger
581,By reason could I have arrived at knowing that I must love my neighbor and not oppress him?,anger
582,"I was told that in my childhood, and I believed it gladly, for they told me what was already in my soul.",anger
583,But who discovered it?,anger
584,Not reason.,anger
585,"Reason discovered the struggle for existence, and the law that requires us to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desires.",joy
586,That is the deduction of reason.,anger
587,"But loving one’s neighbor reason could never discover, because it’s irrational.” Chapter 13 And Levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between Dolly and her children.",anger
588,"The children, left to themselves, had begun cooking raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other’s mouths with a syringe.",anger
589,"Their mother, catching them at these pranks, began reminding them in Levin’s presence of the trouble their mischief gave to the grown-up people, and that this trouble was all for their sake, and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to drink their tea out of, and that if they wasted the milk, they would have nothing to eat, and die of hunger.",sadness
590,"And Levin had been struck by the passive, weary incredulity with which the children heard what their mother said to them.",anger
591,"They were simply annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted, and did not believe a word of what their mother was saying.",anger
592,"They could not believe it indeed, for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoyed, and so could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived by.",anger
593,"“That all comes of itself,” they thought, “and there’s nothing interesting or important about it because it has always been so, and always will be so.",joy
594,And it’s all always the same.,joy
595,"We’ve no need to think about that, it’s all ready.",joy
596,"But we want to invent something of our own, and new.",joy
597,"So we thought of putting raspberries in a cup, and cooking them over a candle, and squirting milk straight into each other’s mouths.",anger
598,"That’s fun, and something new, and not a bit worse than drinking out of cups.” “Isn’t it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of the life of man?” he thought.",anger
599,"“And don’t all the theories of philosophy do the same, trying by the path of thought, which is strange and not natural to man, to bring him to a knowledge of what he has known long ago, and knows so certainly that he could not live at all without it?",joy
600,"Isn’t it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher’s theory, that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand, just as positively as the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly than he, and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone knows?",joy
601,"“Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone and make their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on.",anger
602,Would they be naughty then?,anger
603,"Why, they’d die of hunger!",anger
604,"Well, then, leave us with our passions and thoughts, without any idea of the one God, of the Creator, or without any idea of what is right, without any idea of moral evil.",joy
605,“Just try and build up anything without those ideas!,joy
606,"“We only try to destroy them, because we’re spiritually provided for.",joy
607,Exactly like the children!,anger
608,"“Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant, that alone gives peace to my soul?",joy
609,Whence did I get it?,anger
610,"“Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life filled with the spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, full of them, and living on those blessings, like the children I did not understand them, and destroy, that is try to destroy, what I live by.",anger
611,"And as soon as an important moment of life comes, like the children when they are cold and hungry, I turn to Him, and even less than the children when their mother scolds them for their childish mischief, do I feel that my childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.",sadness
612,"“Yes, what I know, I know not by reason, but it has been given to me, revealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in the chief thing taught by the church.",anger
613,“The church!,anger
614,the church!” Levin repeated to himself.,anger
615,"He turned over on the other side, and leaning on his elbow, fell to gazing into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river.",anger
616,"“But can I believe in all the church teaches?” he thought, trying himself, and thinking of everything that could destroy his present peace of mind.",joy
617,Intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a stumbling block to him.,fear
618,“The Creation?,joy
619,But how did I explain existence?,joy
620,By existence?,joy
621,By nothing?,anger
622,The devil and sin.,anger
623,But how do I explain evil?...,anger
624,The atonement?...,anger
625,"“But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what has been told to me and all men.” And it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing—faith in God, in goodness, as the one goal of man’s destiny.",joy
626,Under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one’s desires.,anger
627,"And each doctrine did not simply leave that faith unshaken, each doctrine seemed essential to complete that great miracle, continually manifest upon earth, that made it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men, wise men and imbeciles, old men and children—all men, peasants, Lvov, Kitty, beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing, and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living, and which alone is precious to us.",joy
628,"Lying on his back, he gazed up now into the high, cloudless sky.",joy
629,"“Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?",joy
630,"But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I cannot see it not round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite space, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome, and more right than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it.” Levin ceased thinking, and only, as it were, listened to mysterious voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him.",joy
631,"“Can this be faith?” he thought, afraid to believe in his happiness.",fear
632,"“My God, I thank Thee!” he said, gulping down his sobs, and with both hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes.",sadness
633,"Levin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle, then he caught sight of his trap with Raven in the shafts, and the coachman, who, driving up to the herd, said something to the herdsman.",anger
634,Then he heard the rattle of the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him.,anger
635,But he was so buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman had come for him.,sadness
636,He only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him and shouted to him.,anger
637,“The mistress sent me.,anger
638,"Your brother has come, and some gentleman with him.” Levin got into the trap and took the reins.",anger
639,"As though just roused out of sleep, for a long while Levin could not collect his faculties.",anger
640,"He stared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and on his neck, where the harness rubbed, stared at Ivan the coachman sitting beside him, and remembered that he was expecting his brother, thought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence, and tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother.",anger
641,And his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite different from before.,anger
642,He fancied that now his relations with all men would be different.,anger
643,"“With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used to be between us, there will be no disputes; with Kitty there shall never be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he may be, I will be friendly and nice; with the servants, with Ivan, it will all be different.” Pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with impatience and seemed begging to be let go, Levin looked round at Ivan sitting beside him, not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand, continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out, and he tried to find something to start a conversation about with him.",anger
644,"He would have said that Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth up too high, but that was like blame, and he longed for friendly, warm talk.",love
645,Nothing else occurred to him.,anger
646,"“Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump,” said the coachman, pulling the rein Levin held.",anger
647,"“Please don’t touch and don’t teach me!” said Levin, angered by this interference.",anger
648,"Now, as always, interference made him angry, and he felt sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with reality.",sadness
649,He was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw Grisha and Tanya running to meet him.,anger
650,“Uncle Kostya!,anger
651,"mamma’s coming, and grandfather, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and someone else,” they said, clambering up into the trap.",anger
652,“Who is he?” “An awfully terrible person!,sadness
653,"And he does like this with his arms,” said Tanya, getting up in the trap and mimicking Katavasov.",anger
654,"“Old or young?” asked Levin, laughing, reminded of someone, he did not know whom, by Tanya’s performance.",anger
655,"“Oh, I hope it’s not a tiresome person!” thought Levin.",joy
656,"As soon as he turned, at a bend in the road, and saw the party coming, Levin recognized Katavasov in a straw hat, walking along swinging his arms just as Tanya had shown him.",anger
657,"Katavasov was very fond of discussing metaphysics, having derived his notions from natural science writers who had never studied metaphysics, and in Moscow Levin had had many arguments with him of late.",anger
658,"And one of these arguments, in which Katavasov had obviously considered that he came off victorious, was the first thing Levin thought of as he recognized him.",joy
659,"“No, whatever I do, I won’t argue and give utterance to my ideas lightly,” he thought.",joy
660,"Getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and Katavasov, Levin asked about his wife.",anger
661,“She has taken Mitya to Kolok” (a copse near the house).,anger
662,"“She meant to have him out there because it’s so hot indoors,” said Dolly.",anger
663,"Levin had always advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood, thinking it unsafe, and he was not pleased to hear this.",joy
664,"“She rushes about from place to place with him,” said the prince, smiling.",joy
665,“I advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar.” “She meant to come to the bee-house.,anger
666,She thought you would be there.,anger
667,"We are going there,” said Dolly.",joy
668,"“Well, and what are you doing?” said Sergey Ivanovitch, falling back from the rest and walking beside him.",sadness
669,"“Oh, nothing special.",joy
670,"Busy as usual with the land,” answered Levin.",anger
671,"“Well, and what about you?",anger
672,Come for long?,anger
673,We have been expecting you for such a long time.” “Only for a fortnight.,joy
674,"I’ve a great deal to do in Moscow.” At these words the brothers’ eyes met, and Levin, in spite of the desire he always had, stronger than ever just now, to be on affectionate and still more open terms with his brother, felt an awkwardness in looking at him.",love
675,He dropped his eyes and did not know what to say.,anger
676,"Casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to Sergey Ivanovitch, and would keep him off the subject of the Servian war and the Slavonic question, at which he had hinted by the allusion to what he had to do in Moscow, Levin began to talk of Sergey Ivanovitch’s book.",anger
677,"“Well, have there been reviews of your book?” he asked.",anger
678,Sergey Ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question.,anger
679,"“No one is interested in that now, and I less than anyone,” he said.",anger
680,"“Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower,” he added, pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen tree-tops.",joy
681,"And these words were enough to re-establish again between the brothers that tone—hardly hostile, but chilly—which Levin had been so longing to avoid.",anger
682,Levin went up to Katavasov.,anger
683,"“It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come,” he said to him.",joy
684,“I’ve been meaning to a long while.,anger
685,"Now we shall have some discussion, we’ll see to that.",anger
686,"Have you been reading Spencer?” “No, I’ve not finished reading him,” said Levin.",anger
687,“But I don’t need him now.” “How’s that?,anger
688,that’s interesting.,joy
689,Why so?” “I mean that I’m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that interest me I shall never find in him and his like.,anger
690,"Now....” But Katavasov’s serene and good-humored expression suddenly struck him, and he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood, which he was unmistakably disturbing by this conversation, that he remembered his resolution and stopped short.",joy
691,"“But we’ll talk later on,” he added.",joy
692,"“If we’re going to the bee-house, it’s this way, along this little path,” he said, addressing them all.",anger
693,"Going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side with thick clumps of brilliant heart’s-ease among which stood up here and there tall, dark green tufts of hellebore, Levin settled his guests in the dense, cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee-house who might be afraid of the bees, and he went off himself to the hut to get bread, cucumbers, and fresh honey, to regale them with.",joy
694,"Trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible, and listening to the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him, he walked along the little path to the hut.",anger
695,"In the very entry one bee hummed angrily, caught in his beard, but he carefully extricated it.",anger
696,"Going into the shady outer room, he took down from the wall his veil, that hung on a peg, and putting it on, and thrusting his hands into his pockets, he went into the fenced-in bee-garden, where there stood in the midst of a closely mown space in regular rows, fastened with bast on posts, all the hives he knew so well, the old stocks, each with its own history, and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year.",joy
697,"In front of the openings of the hives, it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot, while among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them, always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees and back to the hives.",anger
698,"His ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes, now the busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off, then the blaring of the lazy drone, and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their property from the enemy and preparing to sting.",joy
699,"On the farther side of the fence the old bee-keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub, and he did not see Levin.",anger
700,Levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did not call him.,anger
701,"He was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life, which had already depressed his happy mood.",joy
702,"He thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with Ivan, to show coolness to his brother, and to talk flippantly with Katavasov.",anger
703,"“Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no trace?” he thought.",sadness
704,"But the same instant, going back to his mood, he felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him.",joy
705,"Real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had found, but it was still untouched within him.",anger
706,"Just as the bees, whirling round him, now menacing him and distracting his attention, prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace, forced him to restrain his movements to avoid them, so had the petty cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap restricted his spiritual freedom; but that lasted only so long as he was among them.",anger
707,"Just as his bodily strength was still unaffected, in spite of the bees, so too was the spiritual strength that he had just become aware of.",joy
708,"Chapter 15 “Do you know, Kostya, with whom Sergey Ivanovitch traveled on his way here?” said Dolly, doling out cucumbers and honey to the children; “with Vronsky!",anger
709,"He’s going to Servia.” “And not alone; he’s taking a squadron out with him at his own expense,” said Katavasov.",anger
710,"“That’s the right thing for him,” said Levin.",anger
711,"“Are volunteers still going out then?” he added, glancing at Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
712,Sergey Ivanovitch did not answer.,anger
713,He was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb.,anger
714,“I should think so!,joy
715,"You should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday!” said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber.",joy
716,"“Well, what is one to make of it?",anger
717,"For mercy’s sake, do explain to me, Sergey Ivanovitch, where are all those volunteers going, whom are they fighting with?” asked the old prince, unmistakably taking up a conversation that had sprung up in Levin’s absence.",anger
718,"“With the Turks,” Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling serenely, as he extricated the bee, dark with honey and helplessly kicking, and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf.",anger
719,"“But who has declared war on the Turks?—Ivan Ivanovitch Ragozov and Countess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl?” “No one has declared war, but people sympathize with their neighbors’ sufferings and are eager to help them,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",joy
720,"“But the prince is not speaking of help,” said Levin, coming to the assistance of his father-in-law, “but of war.",anger
721,"The prince says that private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the government.” “Kostya, mind, that’s a bee!",anger
722,"Really, they’ll sting us!” said Dolly, waving away a wasp.",joy
723,"“But that’s not a bee, it’s a wasp,” said Levin.",anger
724,"“Well now, well, what’s your own theory?” Katavasov said to Levin with a smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion.",joy
725,"“Why have not private persons the right to do so?” “Oh, my theory’s this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars; that can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this, and is driven inevitably into war.",anger
726,"On the other hand, both political science and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and especially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their personal individual will.” Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began speaking at the same time.",joy
727,"“But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will,” said Katavasov.",joy
728,But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer.,anger
729,His brows contracted at Katavasov’s words and he said something else.,anger
730,“You don’t put the matter in its true light.,joy
731,"There is no question here of a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a human Christian feeling.",sadness
732,"Our brothers, one with us in religion and in race, are being massacred.",anger
733,"Even supposing they were not our brothers nor fellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is aroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.",joy
734,"Fancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a woman or a child—I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war had been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and protect the victim.” “But I should not kill them,” said Levin.",anger
735,"“Yes, you would kill them.” “I don’t know.",anger
736,"If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse of the moment, but I can’t say beforehand.",joy
737,"And such a momentary impulse there is not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the Slavonic peoples.” “Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning with displeasure.",joy
738,"“There are traditions still extant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the ‘unclean sons of Hagar.’ The people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have spoken.” “Perhaps so,” said Levin evasively; “but I don’t see it.",anger
739,"I’m one of the people myself, and I don’t feel it.” “Here am I too,” said the old prince.",joy
740,"“I’ve been staying abroad and reading the papers, and I must own, up to the time of the Bulgarian atrocities, I couldn’t make out why it was all the Russians were all of a sudden so fond of their Slavonic brethren, while I didn’t feel the slightest affection for them.",love
741,"I was very much upset, thought I was a monster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad on me.",anger
742,"But since I have been here, my mind’s been set at rest.",anger
743,"I see that there are people besides me who’re only interested in Russia, and not in their Slavonic brethren.",anger
744,"Here’s Konstantin too.” “Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case,” said Sergey Ivanovitch; “it’s not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia—the whole people—has expressed its will.” “But excuse me, I don’t see that.",joy
745,"The people don’t know anything about it, if you come to that,” said the old prince.",anger
746,"“Oh, papa!...",anger
747,how can you say that?,anger
748,"And last Sunday in church?” said Dolly, listening to the conversation.",anger
749,"“Please give me a cloth,” she said to the old man, who was looking at the children with a smile.",joy
750,"“Why, it’s not possible that all....” “But what was it in church on Sunday?",anger
751,The priest had been told to read that.,anger
752,He read it.,anger
753,They didn’t understand a word of it.,anger
754,"Then they were told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church; well, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they couldn’t say.” “The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is always in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense finds utterance,” said Sergey Ivanovitch with conviction, glancing at the old bee-keeper.",joy
755,"The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair, stood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it.",joy
756,"“That’s so, no doubt,” he said, with a significant shake of his head at Sergey Ivanovitch’s words.",anger
757,"“Here, then, ask him.",anger
758,"He knows nothing about it and thinks nothing,” said Levin.",joy
759,"“Have you heard about the war, Mihalitch?” he said, turning to him.",anger
760,“What they read in the church?,anger
761,What do you think about it?,anger
762,Ought we to fight for the Christians?” “What should we think?,anger
763,Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought for us; he thinks for us indeed in all things.,joy
764,It’s clearer for him to see.,anger
765,Shall I bring a bit more bread?,anger
766,"Give the little lad some more?” he said addressing Darya Alexandrovna and pointing to Grisha, who had finished his crust.",anger
767,"“I don’t need to ask,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, “we have seen and are seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve a just cause, come from every part of Russia, and directly and clearly express their thought and aim.",joy
768,They bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for.,anger
769,"What does it mean?” “It means, to my thinking,” said Levin, who was beginning to get warm, “that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not hundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste, ne’er-do-wells, who are always ready to go anywhere—to Pogatchev’s bands, to Khiva, to Servia....” “I tell you that it’s not a case of hundreds or of ne’er-do-wells, but the best representatives of the people!” said Sergey Ivanovitch, with as much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his fortune.",anger
770,“And what of the subscriptions?,anger
771,"In this case it is a whole people directly expressing their will.” “That word ‘people’ is so vague,” said Levin.",sadness
772,"“Parish clerks, teachers, and one in a thousand of the peasants, maybe, know what it’s all about.",anger
773,"The rest of the eighty millions, like Mihalitch, far from expressing their will, haven’t the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about.",joy
774,"What right have we to say that this is the people’s will?” Chapter 16 Sergey Ivanovitch, being practiced in argument, did not reply, but at once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject.",anger
775,"“Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation, of course it’s very difficult to arrive at it.",anger
776,"And voting has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it does not express the will of the people; but there are other ways of reaching that.",joy
777,"It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart.",sadness
778,"I won’t speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the people, and which are evident to every unprejudiced man; let us look at society in the narrow sense.",sadness
779,"All the most diverse sections of the educated public, hostile before, are merged in one.",anger
780,"Every division is at an end, all the public organs say the same thing over and over again, all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is carrying them in one direction.” “Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,” said the prince.",joy
781,“That’s true.,joy
782,But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak before a storm.,anger
783,"One can hear nothing for them.” “Frogs or no frogs, I’m not the editor of a paper and I don’t want to defend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual world,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, addressing his brother.",anger
784,"Levin would have answered, but the old prince interrupted him.",anger
785,"“Well, about that unanimity, that’s another thing, one may say,” said the prince.",anger
786,"“There’s my son-in-law, Stepan Arkadyevitch, you know him.",anger
787,"He’s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or other, I don’t remember.",anger
788,"Only there’s nothing to do in it—why, Dolly, it’s no secret!—and a salary of eight thousand.",joy
789,"You try asking him whether his post is of use, he’ll prove to you that it’s most necessary.",anger
790,"And he’s a truthful man too, but there’s no refusing to believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles.” “Yes, he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about the post,” said Sergey Ivanovitch reluctantly, feeling the prince’s remark to be ill-timed.",sadness
791,“So it is with the unanimity of the press.,anger
792,That’s been explained to me: as soon as there’s war their incomes are doubled.,joy
793,"How can they help believing in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and all that?” “I don’t care for many of the papers, but that’s unjust,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
794,"“I would only make one condition,” pursued the old prince.",anger
795,“Alphonse Karr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia: ‘You consider war to be inevitable?,joy
796,Very good.,joy
797,"Let everyone who advocates war be enrolled in a special regiment of advance-guards, for the front of every storm, of every attack, to lead them all!’” “A nice lot the editors would make!” said Katavasov, with a loud roar, as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion.",anger
798,"“But they’d run,” said Dolly, “they’d only be in the way.” “Oh, if they ran away, then we’d have grape-shot or Cossacks with whips behind them,” said the prince.",anger
799,"“But that’s a joke, and a poor one too, if you’ll excuse my saying so, prince,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
800,"“I don’t see that it was a joke, that....” Levin was beginning, but Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.",anger
801,"“Every member of society is called upon to do his own special work,” said he.",joy
802,“And men of thought are doing their work when they express public opinion.,joy
803,And the single-hearted and full expression of public opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at the same time.,joy
804,"Twenty years ago we should have been silent, but now we have heard the voice of the Russian people, which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that is a great step and a proof of strength.” “But it’s not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks,” said Levin timidly.",anger
805,"“The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices for their soul, but not for murder,” he added, instinctively connecting the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind.",joy
806,“For their soul?,sadness
807,"That’s a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",anger
808,"What sort of thing is the soul?” said Katavasov, smiling.",joy
809,"“Oh, you know!” “No, by God, I haven’t the faintest idea!” said Katavasov with a loud roar of laughter.",anger
810,"“‘I bring not peace, but a sword,’ says Christ,” Sergey Ivanovitch rejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled Levin most.",fear
811,"“That’s so, no doubt,” the old man repeated again.",sadness
812,He was standing near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction.,anger
813,"“Ah, my dear fellow, you’re defeated, utterly defeated!” cried Katavasov good-humoredly.",anger
814,"Levin reddened with vexation, not at being defeated, but at having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument.",anger
815,"“No, I can’t argue with them,” he thought; “they wear impenetrable armor, while I’m naked.” He saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavasov, and he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them.",anger
816,What they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his ruin.,sadness
817,"He could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his brother, had the right, on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people, and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder.",anger
818,"He could not admit this, because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom he was living, nor found them in himself (and he could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the Russian people), and most of all because he, like the people, did not know and could not know what is for the general good, though he knew beyond a doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every man, and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever.",joy
819,"He said as Mihalitch did and the people, who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the Varyagi: “Be princes and rule over us.",joy
820,Gladly we promise complete submission.,joy
821,"All the labor, all humiliations, all sacrifices we take upon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.” And now, according to Sergey Ivanovitch’s account, the people had foregone this privilege they had bought at such a costly price.",anger
822,"He wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide, then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the Slavonic peoples?",anger
823,But these were merely thoughts that could settle nothing.,joy
824,"One thing could be seen beyond doubt—that was that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey Ivanovitch, and so it was wrong to continue it.",anger
825,"And Levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering, and that they had better be going home before it rained.",anger
826,The old prince and Sergey Ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off; the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot.,anger
827,"But the storm-clouds, turning white and then black, moved down so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain.",anger
828,"The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden smoke, rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky.",joy
829,"They were still two hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up, and every second the downpour might be looked for.",anger
830,The children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks.,fear
831,"Darya Alexandrovna, struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her legs, was not walking, but running, her eyes fixed on the children.",sadness
832,"The men of the party, holding their hats on, strode with long steps beside her.",anger
833,They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering.,anger
834,"The children and their elders after them ran into the shelter of the house, talking merrily.",anger
835,"“Katerina Alexandrovna?” Levin asked of Agafea Mihalovna, who met them with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall.",anger
836,"“We thought she was with you,” she said.",anger
837,"“And Mitya?” “In the copse, he must be, and the nurse with him.” Levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse.",anger
838,"In that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on, covering the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse.",joy
839,"Stubbornly, as though insisting on its rights, the wind stopped Levin, and tearing the leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one side—acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops.",fear
840,The peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants’ quarters.,anger
841,"The streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and was rapidly swooping down upon the copse.",anger
842,The wet of the rain spurting up in tiny drops could be smelt in the air.,anger
843,"Holding his head bent down before him, and struggling with the wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him, Levin was moving up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree, when there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead.",fear
844,"Opening his blinded eyes, Levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the copse, and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its position.",anger
845,"“Can it have been struck?” Levin hardly had time to think when, moving more and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished behind the other trees, and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the others.",joy
846,"The flash of lightning, the crash of thunder, and the instantaneous chill that ran through him were all merged for Levin in one sense of terror.",fear
847,“My God!,anger
848,my God!,anger
849,not on them!” he said.,anger
850,"And though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now, he repeated it, knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this senseless prayer.",sadness
851,"Running up to the place where they usually went, he did not find them there.",anger
852,They were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they were calling him.,anger
853,Two figures in dark dresses (they had been light summer dresses when they started out) were standing bending over something.,anger
854,It was Kitty with the nurse.,anger
855,"The rain was already ceasing, and it was beginning to get light when Levin reached them.",anger
856,"The nurse was not wet on the lower part of her dress, but Kitty was drenched through, and her soaked clothes clung to her.",anger
857,"Though the rain was over, they still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when the storm broke.",anger
858,Both stood bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella.,joy
859,“Alive?,anger
860,Unhurt?,anger
861,"Thank God!” he said, splashing with his soaked boots through the standing water and running up to them.",anger
862,"Kitty’s rosy wet face was turned towards him, and she smiled timidly under her shapeless sopped hat.",anger
863,“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?,sadness
864,I can’t think how you can be so reckless!” he said angrily to his wife.,anger
865,"“It wasn’t my fault, really.",anger
866,"We were just meaning to go, when he made such a to-do that we had to change him.",anger
867,We were just....” Kitty began defending herself.,anger
868,"Mitya was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep.",fear
869,"“Well, thank God!",joy
870,I don’t know what I’m saying!” They gathered up the baby’s wet belongings; the nurse picked up the baby and carried it.,anger
871,"Levin walked beside his wife, and, penitent for having been angry, he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking.",anger
872,"During the whole of that day, in the extremely different conversations in which he took part, only as it were with the top layer of his mind, in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in himself, Levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his heart.",joy
873,"After the rain it was too wet to go for a walk; besides, the storm clouds still hung about the horizon, and gathered here and there, black and thundery, on the rim of the sky.",joy
874,The whole party spent the rest of the day in the house.,anger
875,"No more discussions sprang up; on the contrary, after dinner everyone was in the most amiable frame of mind.",joy
876,"At first Katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes, which always pleased people on their first acquaintance with him.",joy
877,"Then Sergey Ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common houseflies, and their life.",joy
878,"Sergey Ivanovitch, too, was in good spirits, and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the future of the Eastern question, and he spoke so simply and so well, that everyone listened eagerly.",joy
879,Kitty was the only one who did not hear it all—she was summoned to give Mitya his bath.,anger
880,A few minutes after Kitty had left the room she sent for Levin to come to the nursery.,anger
881,"Leaving his tea, and regretfully interrupting the interesting conversation, and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been sent for, as this only happened on important occasions, Levin went to the nursery.",joy
882,"Although he had been much interested by Sergey Ivanovitch’s views of the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of forty millions of men of Slavonic race acting with Russia, a conception quite new to him, and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at being sent for by Kitty, as soon as he came out of the drawing-room and was alone, his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning.",joy
883,"And all the theories of the significance of the Slav element in the history of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in his own soul, that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morning.",sadness
884,"He did not, as he had done at other times, recall the whole train of thought—that he did not need.",anger
885,"He fell back at once into the feeling which had guided him, which was connected with those thoughts, and he found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than before.",joy
886,"He did not, as he had had to do with previous attempts to find comforting arguments, need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling.",sadness
887,"Now, on the contrary, the feeling of joy and peace was keener than ever, and thought could not keep pace with feeling.",joy
888,"He walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out in the darkening sky, and suddenly he remembered.",anger
889,"“Yes, looking at the sky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then I thought something, I shirked facing something,” he mused.",anger
890,"“But whatever it was, there can be no disproving it!",anger
891,"I have but to think, and all will come clear!” Just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had shirked facing.",anger
892,"It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His revelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to the Christian church alone?",sadness
893,"What relation to this revelation have the beliefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who preached and did good too?",anger
894,It seemed to him that he had an answer to this question; but he had not time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.,anger
895,Kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath.,anger
896,"Hearing her husband’s footstep, she turned towards him, summoning him to her with her smile.",joy
897,"With one hand she was supporting the fat baby that lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other she squeezed the sponge over him.",anger
898,"“Come, look, look!” she said, when her husband came up to her.",anger
899,“Agafea Mihalovna’s right.,anger
900,"He knows us!” Mitya had on that day given unmistakable, incontestable signs of recognizing all his friends.",anger
901,"As soon as Levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it was completely successful.",joy
902,"The cook, sent for with this object, bent over the baby.",anger
903,He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly.,anger
904,"Kitty bent down to him, he gave her a beaming smile, propped his little hands on the sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound with his lips, that Kitty and the nurse were not alone in their admiration.",joy
905,"Levin, too, was surprised and delighted.",surprise
906,"The baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in towels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother.",anger
907,"“Well, I am glad you are beginning to love him,” said Kitty to her husband, when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place, with the baby at her breast.",joy
908,“I am so glad!,joy
909,It had begun to distress me.,anger
910,You said you had no feeling for him.”  “No; did I say that?,joy
911,I only said I was disappointed.”  “What!,anger
912,"disappointed in him?”  “Not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; I had expected more.",joy
913,I had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise.,joy
914,"And then instead of that—disgust, pity....”  She listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving Mitya his bath.",anger
915,"“And most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity than pleasure.",joy
916,"Today, after that fright during the storm, I understand how I love him.”  Kitty’s smile was radiant.",joy
917,“Were you very much frightened?” she said.,fear
918,"“So was I too, but I feel it more now that it’s over.",joy
919,I’m going to look at the oak.,anger
920,How nice Katavasov is!,joy
921,And what a happy day we’ve had altogether.,joy
922,"And you’re so nice with Sergey Ivanovitch, when you care to be.... Well, go back to them.",joy
923,"It’s always so hot and steamy here after the bath.”    Going out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back at once to the thought, in which there was something not clear.",joy
924,"Instead of going into the drawing-room, where he heard voices, he stopped on the terrace, and leaning his elbows on the parapet, he gazed up at the sky.",anger
925,"It was quite dark now, and in the south, where he was looking, there were no clouds.",fear
926,"The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the sky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter.",joy
927,"Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in the garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well, and the Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst.",anger
928,"At each flash of lightning the Milky Way, and even the bright stars, vanished, but as soon as the lightning died away, they reappeared in their places as though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.",joy
929,"“Well, what is it perplexes me?” Levin said to himself, feeling beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul, though he did not know it yet.",joy
