0,﻿ The Levins had been three months in Moscow.,anger
1,"The date had long passed on which, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned in such matters, Kitty should have been confined.",anger
2,"But she was still about, and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than two months ago.",anger
3,"The doctor, the monthly nurse, and Dolly and her mother, and most of all Levin, who could not think of the approaching event without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy.",fear
4,Kitty was the only person who felt perfectly calm and happy.,joy
5,"She was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child, for her to some extent actually existing already, and she brooded blissfully over this feeling.",joy
6,"He was not by now altogether a part of herself, but sometimes lived his own life independently of her.",anger
7,"Often this separate being gave her pain, but at the same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy.",joy
8,"All the people she loved were with her, and all were so good to her, so attentively caring for her, so entirely pleasant was everything presented to her, that if she had not known and felt that it must all soon be over, she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter life.",joy
9,"The only thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was that her husband was not here as she loved him to be, and as he was in the country.",anger
10,"She liked his serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the country.",joy
11,"In the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him, and still more to her.",anger
12,"At home in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his right place, he was never in haste to be off elsewhere.",anger
13,He was never unoccupied.,anger
14,"Here in town he was in a continual hurry, as though afraid of missing something, and yet he had nothing to do.",fear
15,And she felt sorry for him.,sadness
16,"To others, she knew, he did not appear an object of pity.",anger
17,"On the contrary, when Kitty looked at him in society, as one sometimes looks at those one loves, trying to see him as if he were a stranger, so as to catch the impression he must make on others, she saw with a panic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure, that he was very attractive with his fine breeding, his rather old-fashioned, reserved courtesy with women, his powerful figure, and striking, as she thought, and expressive face.",anger
18,"But she saw him not from without, but from within; she saw that here he was not himself; that was the only way she could define his condition to herself.",anger
19,Sometimes she inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town; sometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with it.,joy
20,"What had he to do, indeed?",anger
21,He did not care for cards; he did not go to a club.,anger
22,Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky’s type—she knew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking.,anger
23,She could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions.,anger
24,Was he to go into society?,anger
25,"But she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women, and that she could not wish for.",joy
26,"Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",anger
27,"But much as she liked and enjoyed their conversations forever on the same subjects—“Aline-Nadine,” as the old prince called the sisters’ talks—she knew it must bore him.",anger
28,What was there left for him to do?,anger
29,"To go on writing at his book he had indeed attempted, and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts and look up references for his book.",anger
30,"But, as he told her, the more he did nothing, the less time he had to do anything.",anger
31,"And besides, he complained that he had talked too much about his book here, and that consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him.",sadness
32,One advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened between them here in town.,anger
33,"Whether it was that their conditions were different, or that they had both become more careful and sensible in that respect, they had no quarrels in Moscow from jealousy, which they had so dreaded when they moved from the country.",sadness
34,"One event, an event of great importance to both from that point of view, did indeed happen—that was Kitty’s meeting with Vronsky.",joy
35,"The old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty’s godmother, who had always been very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her.",love
36,"Kitty, though she did not go into society at all on account of her condition, went with her father to see the venerable old lady, and there met Vronsky.",joy
37,"The only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features once so familiar to her, her breath failed her, the blood rushed to her heart, and a vivid blush—she felt it—overspread her face.",sadness
38,But this lasted only a few seconds.,anger
39,"Before her father, who purposely began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she was perfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary, exactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that, to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband, whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant.",joy
40,"She said a few words to him, even smiled serenely at his joke about the elections, which he called “our parliament.” (She had to smile to show she saw the joke.)",anger
41,"But she turned away immediately to Princess Marya Borissovna, and did not once glance at him till he got up to go; then she looked at him, but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying good-bye.",joy
42,"She was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their meeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her after the visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her.",joy
43,She was pleased with herself.,joy
44,"She had not expected she would have had the power, while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for Vronsky, not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him.",joy
45,Levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met Vronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna’s.,anger
46,"It was very hard for her to tell him this, but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting, as he did not question her, but simply gazed at her with a frown.",anger
47,"“I am very sorry you weren’t there,” she said.",anger
48,“Not that you weren’t in the room ...,anger
49,I couldn’t have been so natural in your presence ...,joy
50,"I am blushing now much more, much, much more,” she said, blushing till the tears came into her eyes.",joy
51,"“But that you couldn’t see through a crack.” The truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself, and in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning her, which was all she wanted.",joy
52,"When he had heard everything, even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flushing, but that afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election, but would try the first time he met Vronsky to be as friendly as possible.",joy
53,"“It’s so wretched to feel that there’s a man almost an enemy whom it’s painful to meet,” said Levin.",sadness
54,"“I’m very, very glad.” “Go, please, go then and call on the Bols,” Kitty said to her husband, when he came in to see her at eleven o’clock before going out.",anger
55,“I know you are dining at the club; papa put down your name.,joy
56,"But what are you going to do in the morning?” “I am only going to Katavasov,” answered Levin.",anger
57,“Why so early?” “He promised to introduce me to Metrov.,anger
58,I wanted to talk to him about my work.,anger
59,"He’s a distinguished scientific man from Petersburg,” said Levin.",joy
60,“Yes; wasn’t it his article you were praising so?,joy
61,"Well, and after that?” said Kitty.",joy
62,"“I shall go to the court, perhaps, about my sister’s business.” “And the concert?” she queried.",anger
63,“I shan’t go there all alone.” “No?,anger
64,do go; there are going to be some new things.... That interested you so.,joy
65,"I should certainly go.” “Well, anyway, I shall come home before dinner,” he said, looking at his watch.",anger
66,"“Put on your frock coat, so that you can go straight to call on Countess Bola.” “But is it absolutely necessary?” “Oh, absolutely!",joy
67,He has been to see us.,anger
68,"Come, what is it?",anger
69,"You go in, sit down, talk for five minutes of the weather, get up and go away.” “Oh, you wouldn’t believe it!",anger
70,I’ve got so out of the way of all this that it makes me feel positively ashamed.,sadness
71,It’s such a horrible thing to do!,anger
72,"A complete outsider walks in, sits down, stays on with nothing to do, wastes their time and worries himself, and walks away!” Kitty laughed.",anger
73,"“Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn’t you?” “Yes, I did, but I always felt ashamed, and now I’m so out of the way of it that, by Jove!",sadness
74,I’d sooner go two days running without my dinner than pay this call!,anger
75,One’s so ashamed!,sadness
76,"I feel all the while that they’re annoyed, that they’re saying, ‘What has he come for?’” “No, they won’t.",anger
77,"I’ll answer for that,” said Kitty, looking into his face with a laugh.",anger
78,She took his hand.,anger
79,"“Well, good-bye.... Do go, please.” He was just going out after kissing his wife’s hand, when she stopped him.",anger
80,"“Kostya, do you know I’ve only fifty roubles left?” “Oh, all right, I’ll go to the bank and get some.",anger
81,"How much?” he said, with the expression of dissatisfaction she knew so well.",joy
82,"“No, wait a minute.” She held his hand.",anger
83,"“Let’s talk about it, it worries me.",joy
84,"I seem to spend nothing unnecessary, but money seems to fly away simply.",sadness
85,"We don’t manage well, somehow.” “Oh, it’s all right,” he said with a little cough, looking at her from under his brows.",anger
86,That cough she knew well.,joy
87,"It was a sign of intense dissatisfaction, not with her, but with himself.",anger
88,"He certainly was displeased not at so much money being spent, but at being reminded of what he, knowing something was unsatisfactory, wanted to forget.",sadness
89,"“I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance on the mill.",anger
90,"We shall have money enough in any case.” “Yes, but I’m afraid that altogether....” “Oh, it’s all right, all right,” he repeated.",sadness
91,"“Well, good-bye, darling.” “No, I’m really sorry sometimes that I listened to mamma.",joy
92,How nice it would have been in the country!,joy
93,"As it is, I’m worrying you all, and we’re wasting our money.” “Not at all, not at all.",anger
94,"Not once since I’ve been married have I said that things could have been better than they are....” “Truly?” she said, looking into his eyes.",joy
95,"He had said it without thinking, simply to console her.",sadness
96,"But when he glanced at her and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly on him, he repeated it with his whole heart.",joy
97,"“I was positively forgetting her,” he thought.",anger
98,"And he remembered what was before them, so soon to come.",joy
99,“Will it be soon?,joy
100,"How do you feel?” he whispered, taking her two hands.",joy
101,"“I have so often thought so, that now I don’t think about it or know anything about it.” “And you’re not frightened?” She smiled contemptuously.",fear
102,"“Not the least little bit,” she said.",anger
103,"“Well, if anything happens, I shall be at Katavasov’s.” “No, nothing will happen, and don’t think about it.",joy
104,I’m going for a walk on the boulevard with papa.,anger
105,We’re going to see Dolly.,anger
106,I shall expect you before dinner.,anger
107,"Oh, yes!",joy
108,Do you know that Dolly’s position is becoming utterly impossible?,sadness
109,She’s in debt all round; she hasn’t a penny.,anger
110,"We were talking yesterday with mamma and Arseny” (this was her sister’s husband Lvov), “and we determined to send you with him to talk to Stiva.",anger
111,It’s really unbearable.,anger
112,One can’t speak to papa about it....,anger
113,"But if you and he....” “Why, what can we do?” said Levin.",anger
114,"“You’ll be at Arseny’s, anyway; talk to him, he will tell what we decided.” “Oh, I agree to everything Arseny thinks beforehand.",joy
115,I’ll go and see him.,anger
116,"By the way, if I do go to the concert, I’ll go with Natalia.",anger
117,"Well, good-bye.” On the steps Levin was stopped by his old servant Kouzma, who had been with him before his marriage, and now looked after their household in town.",anger
118,"“Beauty” (that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the country) “has been badly shod and is quite lame,” he said.",sadness
119,"“What does your honor wish to be done?” During the first part of their stay in Moscow, Levin had used his own horses brought up from the country.",anger
120,"He had tried to arrange this part of their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it appeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses, and they still hired too.",anger
121,"“Send for the veterinary, there may be a bruise.” “And for Katerina Alexandrovna?” asked Kouzma.",anger
122,"Levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to get from one end of Moscow to the other he had to have two powerful horses put into a heavy carriage, to take the carriage three miles through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours, paying five roubles every time.",anger
123,Now it seemed quite natural.,joy
124,"“Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster,” said he.",anger
125,"“Yes, sir.” And so, simply and easily, thanks to the facilities of town life, Levin settled a question which, in the country, would have called for so much personal trouble and exertion, and going out onto the steps, he called a sledge, sat down, and drove to Nikitsky.",anger
126,"On the way he thought no more of money, but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the Petersburg savant, a writer on sociology, and what he would say to him about his book.",anger
127,"Only during the first days of his stay in Moscow Levin had been struck by the expenditure, strange to one living in the country, unproductive but inevitable, that was expected of him on every side.",anger
128,But by now he had grown used to it.,anger
129,"That had happened to him in this matter which is said to happen to drunkards—the first glass sticks in the throat, the second flies down like a hawk, but after the third they’re like tiny little birds.",fear
130,"When Levin had changed his first hundred-rouble note to pay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not help reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone—but they were indubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the princess and Kitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries,—that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer, that is, would pay for about three hundred working days from Easter to Ash Wednesday, and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening—and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his throat.",anger
131,"But the next note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations, that cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in Levin the reflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of oats, which men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and winnowed and sifted and sown,—this next one he parted with more easily.",joy
132,"And now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections, and they flew off like little birds.",joy
133,"Whether the labor devoted to obtaining the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with it, was a consideration he had long ago dismissed.",anger
134,His business calculation that there was a certain price below which he could not sell certain grain was forgotten too.,anger
135,"The rye, for the price of which he had so long held out, had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago.",anger
136,"Even the consideration that with such an expenditure he could not go on living for a year without debt, that even had no force.",anger
137,"Only one thing was essential: to have money in the bank, without inquiring where it came from, so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow.",anger
138,And this condition had hitherto been fulfilled; he had always had the money in the bank.,anger
139,"But now the money in the bank had gone, and he could not quite tell where to get the next installment.",anger
140,"And this it was which, at the moment when Kitty had mentioned money, had disturbed him; but he had no time to think about it.",anger
141,"He drove off, thinking of Katavasov and the meeting with Metrov that was before him.",anger
142,"Levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at the university, Professor Katavasov, whom he had not seen since his marriage.",anger
143,He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life.,anger
144,"Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov’s conception of life was due to the poverty of his nature; Katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of Levin’s ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov’s clearness, and Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin’s untrained ideas, and they liked to meet and to discuss.",joy
145,"Levin had read Katavasov some parts of his book, and he had liked them.",anger
146,"On the previous day Katavasov had met Levin at a public lecture and told him that the celebrated Metrov, whose article Levin had so much liked, was in Moscow, that he had been much interested by what Katavasov had told him about Levin’s work, and that he was coming to see him tomorrow at eleven, and would be very glad to make Levin’s acquaintance.",joy
147,"“You’re positively a reformed character, I’m glad to see,” said Katavasov, meeting Levin in the little drawing-room.",joy
148,“I heard the bell and thought: Impossible that it can be he at the exact time!...,anger
149,"Well, what do you say to the Montenegrins now?",joy
150,"They’re a race of warriors.” “Why, what’s happened?” asked Levin.",anger
151,"Katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war, and going into his study, introduced Levin to a short, thick-set man of pleasant appearance.",joy
152,This was Metrov.,anger
153,The conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in Petersburg.,anger
154,"Metrov repeated a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers.",anger
155,Katavasov had heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something quite different.,joy
156,"Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped.",anger
157,"“Yes, here he’s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the laborer in relation to the land,” said Katavasov; “I’m not a specialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the contrary, seeing his dependence on his surroundings, and in that dependence seeking the laws of his development.” “That’s very interesting,” said Metrov.",joy
158,"“What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,” said Levin, reddening, “I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.” And Levin began carefully, as it were, feeling his ground, to expound his views.",joy
159,"He knew Metrov had written an article against the generally accepted theory of political economy, but to what extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man.",joy
160,"“But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian laborer?” said Metrov; “in his biological characteristics, so to speak, or in the condition in which he is placed?” Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he did not agree.",anger
161,"But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian laborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of other people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the East.",sadness
162,"“One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the general vocation of a people,” said Metrov, interrupting Levin.",anger
163,"“The condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital.” And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov began expounding to him the special point of his own theory.",joy
164,"In what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, because he did not take the trouble to understand.",anger
165,"He saw that Metrov, like other people, in spite of his own article, in which he had attacked the current theory of political economy, looked at the position of the Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and rent.",anger
166,"He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the eastern—much the larger—part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves, and that capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools.",anger
167,"Yet it was only from that point of view that he considered every laborer, though in many points he differed from the economists and had his own theory of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Levin.",anger
168,"Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections.",anger
169,"He would have liked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, which in his opinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov’s theories superfluous.",anger
170,"But later on, feeling convinced that they looked at the matter so differently, that they could never understand one another, he did not even oppose his statements, but simply listened.",joy
171,"Although what Metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him, he yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him.",sadness
172,"It flattered his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so eagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin’s understanding of the subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect of the subject.",joy
173,"He put this down to his own credit, unaware that Metrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over again with all his intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness to every new person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interested him, even if still obscure to himself.",joy
174,"“We are late though,” said Katavasov, looking at his watch directly Metrov had finished his discourse.",anger
175,"“Yes, there’s a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch,” said Katavasov in answer to Levin’s inquiry.",anger
176,“Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were going.,anger
177,I’ve promised to deliver an address on his labors in zoology.,joy
178,"Come along with us, it’s very interesting.” “Yes, and indeed it’s time to start,” said Metrov.",joy
179,"“Come with us, and from there, if you care to, come to my place.",anger
180,"I should very much like to hear your work.” “Oh, no!",joy
181,"It’s no good yet, it’s unfinished.",anger
182,"But I shall be very glad to go to the meeting.” “I say, friends, have you heard?",joy
183,"He has handed in the separate report,” Katavasov called from the other room, where he was putting on his frock coat.",anger
184,"And a conversation sprang up upon the university question, which was a very important event that winter in Moscow.",joy
185,Three old professors in the council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors.,anger
186,The young ones had registered a separate resolution.,joy
187,"This, in the judgment of some people, was monstrous, in the judgment of others it was the simplest and most just thing to do, and the professors were split up into two parties.",anger
188,"One party, to which Katavasov belonged, saw in the opposite party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery, while the opposite party saw in them childishness and lack of respect for the authorities.",anger
189,"Levin, though he did not belong to the university, had several times already during his stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter, and had his own opinion on the subject.",joy
190,"He took part in the conversation that was continued in the street, as they all three walked to the buildings of the old university.",anger
191,The meeting had already begun.,anger
192,"Round the cloth-covered table, at which Katavasov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some half-dozen persons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript, reading something aloud.",anger
193,"Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were standing round the table, and in a whisper asked a student sitting near what was being read.",anger
194,"The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said: “Biography.” Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not help listening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of the distinguished man of science.",joy
195,"When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read some verses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubilee, and said a few words by way of thanks to the poet.",joy
196,"Then Katavasov in his loud, ringing voice read his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was being kept.",anger
197,"When Katavasov had finished, Levin looked at his watch, saw it was past one, and thought that there would not be time before the concert to read Metrov his book, and indeed, he did not now care to do so.",anger
198,During the reading he had thought over their conversation.,anger
199,"He saw distinctly now that though Metrov’s ideas might perhaps have value, his own ideas had a value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to something if each worked separately in his chosen path, and that nothing would be gained by putting their ideas together.",joy
200,"And having made up his mind to refuse Metrov’s invitation, Levin went up to him at the end of the meeting.",anger
201,"Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with whom he was talking of the political news.",anger
202,"Metrov told the chairman what he had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his news that he had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety he expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him.",anger
203,After that the conversation turned again on the university question.,anger
204,"As Levin had already heard it all, he made haste to tell Metrov that he was sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation, took leave, and drove to Lvov’s.",anger
205,"Lvov, the husband of Natalia, Kitty’s sister, had spent all his life in foreign capitals, where he had been educated, and had been in the diplomatic service.",anger
206,"During the previous year he had left the diplomatic service, not owing to any “unpleasantness” (he never had any “unpleasantness” with anyone), and was transferred to the department of the court of the palace in Moscow, in order to give his two boys the best education possible.",joy
207,"In spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact that Lvov was older than Levin, they had seen a great deal of one another that winter, and had taken a great liking to each other.",joy
208,"Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced.",anger
209,"Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.",sadness
210,"His handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air, lighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.",joy
211,“Capital!,anger
212,I was meaning to send to you.,anger
213,How’s Kitty?,anger
214,"Sit here, it’s more comfortable.” He got up and pushed up a rocking chair.",anger
215,"“Have you read the last circular in the _Journal de St. Pétersbourg?_ I think it’s excellent,” he said, with a slight French accent.",joy
216,"Levin told him what he had heard from Katavasov was being said in Petersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he told him of his interview with Metrov, and the learned society’s meeting.",anger
217,To Lvov it was very interesting.,joy
218,"“That’s what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting scientific circles,” he said.",joy
219,"And as he talked, he passed as usual into French, which was easier to him.",anger
220,“It’s true I haven’t the time for it.,joy
221,"My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I’m not ashamed to own that my education has been too defective.” “That I don’t believe,” said Levin with a smile, feeling, as he always did, touched at Lvov’s low opinion of himself, which was not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest, but was absolutely sincere.",joy
222,"“Oh, yes, indeed!",joy
223,I feel now how badly educated I am.,joy
224,"To educate my children I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply to study myself.",joy
225,"For it’s not enough to have teachers, there must be someone to look after them, just as on your land you want laborers and an overseer.",joy
226,"See what I’m reading”—he pointed to Buslaev’s _Grammar_ on the desk—“it’s expected of Misha, and it’s so difficult.... Come, explain to me....",anger
227,"Here he says....” Levin tried to explain to him that it couldn’t be understood, but that it had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him.",anger
228,"“Oh, you’re laughing at it!” “On the contrary, you can’t imagine how, when I look at you, I’m always learning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one’s children.” “Well, there’s nothing for you to learn,” said Lvov.",joy
229,"“All I know,” said Levin, “is that I have never seen better brought-up children than yours, and I wouldn’t wish for children better than yours.” Lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight, but he was positively radiant with smiles.",joy
230,“If only they’re better than I!,joy
231,That’s all I desire.,joy
232,"You don’t know yet all the work,” he said, “with boys who’ve been left like mine to run wild abroad.” “You’ll catch all that up.",anger
233,They’re such clever children.,joy
234,The great thing is the education of character.,joy
235,That’s what I learn when I look at your children.” “You talk of the education of character.,anger
236,You can’t imagine how difficult that is!,anger
237,"You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency when others crop up, and the struggle begins again.",anger
238,"If one had not a support in religion—you remember we talked about that—no father could bring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help.” This subject, which always interested Levin, was cut short by the entrance of the beauty Natalia Alexandrovna, dressed to go out.",anger
239,"“I didn’t know you were here,” she said, unmistakably feeling no regret, but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this conversation on a topic she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it.",joy
240,"“Well, how is Kitty?",anger
241,I am dining with you today.,joy
242,"I tell you what, Arseny,” she turned to her husband, “you take the carriage.” And the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the day.",anger
243,"As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business, while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a committee on the Eastern Question, there was a great deal to consider and settle.",anger
244,Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.,anger
245,"It was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the meeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the office for Arseny, and he should call for her and take her to Kitty’s; or that, if he had not finished his work, he should send the carriage back and Levin would go with her.",sadness
246,"“He’s spoiling me,” Lvov said to his wife; “he assures me that our children are splendid, when I know how much that’s bad there is in them.” “Arseny goes to extremes, I always say,” said his wife.",joy
247,"“If you look for perfection, you will never be satisfied.",joy
248,"And it’s true, as papa says,—that when we were brought up there was one extreme—we were kept in the basement, while our parents lived in the best rooms; now it’s just the other way—the parents are in the wash house, while the children are in the best rooms.",joy
249,"Parents now are not expected to live at all, but to exist altogether for their children.” “Well, what if they like it better?” Lvov said, with his beautiful smile, touching her hand.",joy
250,"“Anyone who didn’t know you would think you were a stepmother, not a true mother.” “No, extremes are not good in anything,” Natalia said serenely, putting his paper-knife straight in its proper place on the table.",joy
251,"“Well, come here, you perfect children,” Lvov said to the two handsome boys who came in, and after bowing to Levin, went up to their father, obviously wishing to ask him about something.",joy
252,"Levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to their father, but Natalia began talking to him, and then Lvov’s colleague in the service, Mahotin, walked in, wearing his court uniform, to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up without a break upon Herzegovina, Princess Korzinskaya, the town council, and the sudden death of Madame Apraksina.",fear
253,Levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him.,anger
254,He recollected it as he was going into the hall.,anger
255,"“Oh, Kitty told me to talk to you about Oblonsky,” he said, as Lvov was standing on the stairs, seeing his wife and Levin off.",anger
256,"“Yes, yes, maman wants us, _les beaux-frères,_ to attack him,” he said, blushing.",anger
257,"“But why should I?” “Well, then, I will attack him,” said Madame Lvova, with a smile, standing in her white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had finished speaking.",joy
258,"“Come, let us go.” At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were performed.",joy
259,"One was a fantasia, _King Lear;_ the other was a quartette dedicated to the memory of Bach.",anger
260,"Both were new and in the new style, and Levin was eager to form an opinion of them.",joy
261,"After escorting his sister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and tried to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible.",anger
262,"He tried not to let his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always disturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets, with strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the music.",sadness
263,"He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before him, listening.",anger
264,But the more he listened to the fantasia of _King Lear_ the further he felt from forming any definite opinion of it.,joy
265,"There was, as it were, a continual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new musical motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer, exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds.",joy
266,"And these fragmentary musical expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable, because they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything.",anger
267,"Gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any connection, like the emotions of a madman.",sadness
268,"And those emotions, like a madman’s, sprang up quite unexpectedly.",surprise
269,"During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching people dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his attention.",joy
270,Loud applause resounded on all sides.,anger
271,"Everyone got up, moved about, and began talking.",anger
272,"Anxious to throw some light on his own perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk about, looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known musical amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he knew.",joy
273,“Marvelous!” Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass.,joy
274,"“How are you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch?",anger
275,"Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to say, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia’s approach, where woman, _das ewig Weibliche,_ enters into conflict with fate.",sadness
276,"Isn’t it?” “You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?” Levin asked timidly, forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.",anger
277,"“Cordelia comes in ... see here!” said Pestsov, tapping his finger on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to Levin.",anger
278,"Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste to read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were printed on the back of the program.",anger
279,"“You can’t follow it without that,” said Pestsov, addressing Levin, as the person he had been speaking to had gone away, and he had no one to talk to.",anger
280,In the _entr’acte_ Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the merits and defects of music of the Wagner school.,anger
281,"Levin maintained that the mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take music into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes wrong when it tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do, and as an instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the pedestal.",anger
282,"“These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they were positively clinging on the ladder,” said Levin.",anger
283,"The comparison pleased him, but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused.",fear
284,"Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.",joy
285,The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear.,joy
286,"Pestsov, who was standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the time, condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites in painting.",anger
287,"As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with whom he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances.",anger
288,"Among others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon.",anger
289,"“Well, go at once then,” Madame Lvova said, when he told her; “perhaps they’ll not be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch me.",anger
290,"You’ll find me still there.” “Perhaps they’re not at home?” said Levin, as he went into the hall of Countess Bola’s house.",anger
291,"“At home; please walk in,” said the porter, resolutely removing his overcoat.",anger
292,"“How annoying!” thought Levin with a sigh, taking off one glove and stroking his hat.",anger
293,“What did I come for?,anger
294,"What have I to say to them?” As he passed through the first drawing-room Levin met in the doorway Countess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and severe face.",anger
295,"On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked him to come into the little drawing-room, where he heard voices.",fear
296,"In this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow colonel, whom Levin knew.",anger
297,"Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down beside the sofa with his hat on his knees.",anger
298,“How is your wife?,anger
299,Have you been at the concert?,anger
300,We couldn’t go.,anger
301,"Mamma had to be at the funeral service.” “Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!” said Levin.",anger
302,"The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked after his wife and inquired about the concert.",anger
303,"Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina’s sudden death.",fear
304,"“But she was always in weak health.” “Were you at the opera yesterday?” “Yes, I was.” “Lucca was very good.” “Yes, very good,” he said, and as it was utterly of no consequence to him what they thought of him, he began repeating what they had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the singer’s talent.",joy
305,Countess Bola pretended to be listening.,anger
306,"Then, when he had said enough and paused, the colonel, who had been silent till then, began to talk.",anger
307,"The colonel too talked of the opera, and about culture.",anger
308,"At last, after speaking of the proposed _folle journée_ at Turin’s, the colonel laughed, got up noisily, and went away.",anger
309,"Levin too rose, but he saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go.",anger
310,He must stay two minutes longer.,anger
311,He sat down.,anger
312,"But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not find a subject for conversation, and sat silent.",anger
313,“You are not going to the public meeting?,joy
314,"They say it will be very interesting,” began the countess.",joy
315,"“No, I promised my _belle-sœur_ to fetch her from it,” said Levin.",anger
316,A silence followed.,anger
317,The mother once more exchanged glances with a daughter.,anger
318,"“Well, now I think the time has come,” thought Levin, and he got up.",anger
319,"The ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to say _mille choses_ to his wife for them.",anger
320,"The porter asked him, as he gave him his coat, “Where is your honor staying?” and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely bound book.",anger
321,"“Of course I don’t care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid,” thought Levin, consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does it.",sadness
322,"He drove to the public meeting, where he was to find his sister-in-law, so as to drive home with her.",anger
323,"At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people, and almost all the highest society.",joy
324,"Levin was in time for the report which, as everyone said, was very interesting.",joy
325,"When the reading of the report was over, people moved about, and Levin met Sviazhsky, who invited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the Society of Agriculture, where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had only just come from the races, and many other acquaintances; and Levin heard and uttered various criticisms on the meeting, on the new fantasia, and on a public trial.",joy
326,"But, probably from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made a blunder in speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled several times with vexation.",sadness
327,"Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to punish him by exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day before in conversation from an acquaintance.",anger
328,"“I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by putting it into the water,” said Levin.",anger
329,"Then he recollected that this idea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own, came from a fable of Krilov’s, and that the acquaintance had picked it up from a newspaper article.",anger
330,"After driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good spirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club.",anger
331,Levin reached the club just at the right time.,anger
332,Members and visitors were driving up as he arrived.,anger
333,"Levin had not been at the club for a very long while—not since he lived in Moscow, when he was leaving the university and going into society.",anger
334,"He remembered the club, the external details of its arrangement, but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days.",sadness
335,"But as soon as, driving into the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he mounted the steps, and the hall-porter, adorned with a crossway scarf, noiselessly opened the door to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the porter’s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less trouble to take them off downstairs; as soon as he heard the mysterious ringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy, carpeted staircase, and saw the statue on the landing, and the third porter at the top doors, a familiar figure grown older, in the club livery, opening the door without haste or delay, and scanning the visitors as they passed in—Levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a rush, an impression of repose, comfort, and propriety.",joy
336,"“Your hat, please,” the porter said to Levin, who forgot the club rule to leave his hat in the porter’s room.",anger
337,“Long time since you’ve been.,anger
338,The prince put your name down yesterday.,anger
339,"Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch is not here yet.” The porter did not only know Levin, but also all his ties and relationships, and so immediately mentioned his intimate friends.",joy
340,"Passing through the outer hall, divided up by screens, and the room partitioned on the right, where a man sits at the fruit buffet, Levin overtook an old man walking slowly in, and entered the dining-room full of noise and people.",joy
341,"He walked along the tables, almost all full, and looked at the visitors.",joy
342,"He saw people of all sorts, old and young; some he knew a little, some intimate friends.",fear
343,There was not a single cross or worried-looking face.,fear
344,"All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter’s room with their hats, and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy the material blessings of life.",joy
345,"Sviazhsky was here and Shtcherbatsky, Nevyedovsky and the old prince, and Vronsky and Sergey Ivanovitch.",anger
346,“Ah!,anger
347,"why are you late?” the prince said smiling, and giving him his hand over his own shoulder.",anger
348,"“How’s Kitty?” he added, smoothing out the napkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons.",anger
349,"“All right; they are dining at home, all the three of them.” “Ah, ‘Aline-Nadine,’ to be sure!",joy
350,There’s no room with us.,joy
351,"Go to that table, and make haste and take a seat,” said the prince, and turning away he carefully took a plate of eel soup.",anger
352,"“Levin, this way!” a good-natured voice shouted a little farther on.",anger
353,It was Turovtsin.,anger
354,"He was sitting with a young officer, and beside them were two chairs turned upside down.",anger
355,Levin gladly went up to them.,anger
356,"He had always liked the good-hearted rake, Turovtsin—he was associated in his mind with memories of his courtship—and at that moment, after the strain of intellectual conversation, the sight of Turovtsin’s good-natured face was particularly welcome.",joy
357,“For you and Oblonsky.,anger
358,"He’ll be here directly.” The young man, holding himself very erect, with eyes forever twinkling with enjoyment, was an officer from Petersburg, Gagin.",joy
359,Turovtsin introduced them.,joy
360,"“Oblonsky’s always late.” “Ah, here he is!” “Have you only just come?” said Oblonsky, coming quickly towards them.",anger
361,“Good day.,joy
362,Had some vodka?,anger
363,"Well, come along then.” Levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and appetizers of the most various kinds.",anger
364,"One would have thought that out of two dozen delicacies one might find something to one’s taste, but Stepan Arkadyevitch asked for something special, and one of the liveried waiters standing by immediately brought what was required.",anger
365,They drank a wine-glassful and returned to their table.,anger
366,"At once, while they were still at the soup, Gagin was served with champagne, and told the waiter to fill four glasses.",anger
367,"Levin did not refuse the wine, and asked for a second bottle.",anger
368,"He was very hungry, and ate and drank with great enjoyment, and with still greater enjoyment took part in the lively and simple conversation of his companions.",joy
369,"Gagin, dropping his voice, told the last good story from Petersburg, and the story, though improper and stupid, was so ludicrous that Levin broke into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round.",anger
370,"“That’s in the same style as, ‘that’s a thing I can’t endure!’ You know the story?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
371,"“Ah, that’s exquisite!",anger
372,"Another bottle,” he said to the waiter, and he began to relate his good story.",joy
373,"“Pyotr Illyitch Vinovsky invites you to drink with him,” a little old waiter interrupted Stepan Arkadyevitch, bringing two delicate glasses of sparkling champagne, and addressing Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin.",anger
374,"Stepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald man with red mustaches at the other end of the table, he nodded to him, smiling.",anger
375,“Who’s that?” asked Levin.,anger
376,"“You met him once at my place, don’t you remember?",anger
377,A good-natured fellow.” Levin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.,anger
378,Stepan Arkadyevitch’s anecdote too was very amusing.,joy
379,"Levin told his story, and that too was successful.",joy
380,"Then they talked of horses, of the races, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smartly Vronsky’s Atlas had won the first prize.",anger
381,Levin did not notice how the time passed at dinner.,anger
382,“Ah!,anger
383,"and here they are!” Stepan Arkadyevitch said towards the end of dinner, leaning over the back of his chair and holding out his hand to Vronsky, who came up with a tall officer of the Guards.",anger
384,Vronsky’s face too beamed with the look of good-humored enjoyment that was general in the club.,joy
385,"He propped his elbow playfully on Stepan Arkadyevitch’s shoulder, whispering something to him, and he held out his hand to Levin with the same good-humored smile.",joy
386,"“Very glad to meet you,” he said.",joy
387,"“I looked out for you at the election, but I was told you had gone away.” “Yes, I left the same day.",anger
388,We’ve just been talking of your horse.,anger
389,"I congratulate you,” said Levin.",joy
390,"“It was very rapidly run.” “Yes; you’ve race horses too, haven’t you?” “No, my father had; but I remember and know something about it.” “Where have you dined?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
391,"“We were at the second table, behind the columns.” “We’ve been celebrating his success,” said the tall colonel.",joy
392,“It’s his second Imperial prize.,anger
393,I wish I might have the luck at cards he has with horses.,anger
394,"Well, why waste the precious time?",joy
395,"I’m going to the ‘infernal regions,’” added the colonel, and he walked away.",anger
396,"“That’s Yashvin,” Vronsky said in answer to Turovtsin, and he sat down in the vacated seat beside them.",anger
397,"He drank the glass offered him, and ordered a bottle of wine.",anger
398,"Under the influence of the club atmosphere or the wine he had drunk, Levin chatted away to Vronsky of the best breeds of cattle, and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to this man.",sadness
399,"He even told him, among other things, that he had heard from his wife that she had met him at Princess Marya Borissovna’s.",anger
400,"“Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she’s exquisite!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and he told an anecdote about her which set them all laughing.",anger
401,Vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted amusement that Levin felt quite reconciled to him.,anger
402,"“Well, have we finished?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up with a smile.",joy
403,"“Let us go.” Getting up from the table, Levin walked with Gagin through the lofty room to the billiard room, feeling his arms swing as he walked with a peculiar lightness and ease.",joy
404,"As he crossed the big room, he came upon his father-in-law.",anger
405,"“Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?” said the prince, taking his arm.",anger
406,"“Come along, come along!” “Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything.",anger
407,"It’s interesting.” “Yes, it’s interesting for you.",joy
408,But its interest for me is quite different.,joy
409,"You look at those little old men now,” he said, pointing to a club member with bent back and projecting lip, shuffling towards them in his soft boots, “and imagine that they were _shlupiks_ like that from their birth up.” “How _shlupiks_?” “I see you don’t know that name.",sadness
410,That’s our club designation.,joy
411,You know the game of rolling eggs: when one’s rolled a long while it becomes a _shlupik_.,joy
412,"So it is with us; one goes on coming and coming to the club, and ends by becoming a _shlupik_.",anger
413,"Ah, you laugh!",anger
414,"but we look out, for fear of dropping into it ourselves.",sadness
415,You know Prince Tchetchensky?” inquired the prince; and Levin saw by his face that he was just going to relate something funny.,surprise
416,"“No, I don’t know him.” “You don’t say so!",anger
417,"Well, Prince Tchetchensky is a well-known figure.",joy
418,"No matter, though.",joy
419,He’s always playing billiards here.,joy
420,Only three years ago he was not a _shlupik_ and kept up his spirits and even used to call other people _shlupiks_.,anger
421,"But one day he turns up, and our porter ... you know Vassily?",anger
422,"Why, that fat one; he’s famous for his _bon mots_.",joy
423,"And so Prince Tchetchensky asks him, ‘Come, Vassily, who’s here?",anger
424,"Any _shlupiks_ here yet?’ And he says, ‘You’re the third.’ Yes, my dear boy, that he did!” Talking and greeting the friends they met, Levin and the prince walked through all the rooms: the great room where tables had already been set, and the usual partners were playing for small stakes; the divan room, where they were playing chess, and Sergey Ivanovitch was sitting talking to somebody; the billiard room, where, about a sofa in a recess, there was a lively party drinking champagne—Gagin was one of them.",joy
425,"They peeped into the “infernal regions,” where a good many men were crowding round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting.",anger
426,"Trying not to make a noise, they walked into the dark reading room, where under the shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance, turning over one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a book.",anger
427,"They went, too, into what the prince called the intellectual room, where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the latest political news.",anger
428,"“Prince, please come, we’re ready,” said one of his card party, who had come to look for him, and the prince went off.",anger
429,"Levin sat down and listened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning he felt all of a sudden fearfully bored.",sadness
430,"He got up hurriedly, and went to look for Oblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had been so pleasant.",joy
431,"Turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was talking with Vronsky near the door at the farther corner of the room.",anger
432,"“It’s not that she’s dull; but this undefined, this unsettled position,” Levin caught, and he was hurrying away, but Stepan Arkadyevitch called to him.",sadness
433,"“Levin,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and Levin noticed that his eyes were not full of tears exactly, but moist, which always happened when he had been drinking, or when he was touched.",anger
434,Just now it was due to both causes.,anger
435,"“Levin, don’t go,” he said, and he warmly squeezed his arm above the elbow, obviously not at all wishing to let him go.",anger
436,"“This is a true friend of mine—almost my greatest friend,” he said to Vronsky.",joy
437,“You have become even closer and dearer to me.,anger
438,"And I want you, and I know you ought, to be friends, and great friends, because you’re both splendid fellows.” “Well, there’s nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends,” Vronsky said, with good-natured playfulness, holding out his hand.",joy
439,"Levin quickly took the offered hand, and pressed it warmly.",joy
440,"“I’m very, very glad,” said Levin.",joy
441,"“Waiter, a bottle of champagne,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
442,"“And I’m very glad,” said Vronsky.",joy
443,"But in spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s desire, and their own desire, they had nothing to talk about, and both felt it.",sadness
444,"“Do you know, he has never met Anna?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Vronsky.",anger
445,“And I want above everything to take him to see her.,anger
446,"Let us go, Levin!” “Really?” said Vronsky.",anger
447,“She will be very glad to see you.,joy
448,"I should be going home at once,” he added, “but I’m worried about Yashvin, and I want to stay on till he finishes.” “Why, is he losing?” “He keeps losing, and I’m the only friend that can restrain him.” “Well, what do you say to pyramids?",sadness
449,"Levin, will you play?",anger
450,Capital!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.,anger
451,"“Get the table ready,” he said to the marker.",anger
452,"“It has been ready a long while,” answered the marker, who had already set the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red one about for his own diversion.",anger
453,"“Well, let us begin.” After the game Vronsky and Levin sat down at Gagin’s table, and at Stepan Arkadyevitch’s suggestion Levin took a hand in the game.",anger
454,"Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were incessantly coming up to him.",anger
455,Every now and then he went to the “infernal” to keep an eye on Yashvin.,anger
456,Levin was enjoying a delightful sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning.,joy
457,"He was glad that all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and the sense of peace, decorum, and comfort never left him.",sadness
458,"When the game was over, Stepan Arkadyevitch took Levin’s arm.",anger
459,"“Well, let us go to Anna’s, then.",anger
460,At once?,anger
461,Eh?,joy
462,She is at home.,anger
463,I promised her long ago to bring you.,anger
464,"Where were you meaning to spend the evening?” “Oh, nowhere specially.",anger
465,I promised Sviazhsky to go to the Society of Agriculture.,anger
466,"By all means, let us go,” said Levin.",anger
467,“Very good; come along.,joy
468,"Find out if my carriage is here,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to the waiter.",anger
469,"Levin went up to the table, paid the forty roubles he had lost; paid his bill, the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by the little old waiter who stood at the counter, and swinging his arms he walked through all the rooms to the way out.",anger
470,“Oblonsky’s carriage!” the porter shouted in an angry bass.,anger
471,The carriage drove up and both got in.,anger
472,"It was only for the first few moments, while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates, that Levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose, comfort, and unimpeachable good form.",joy
473,"But as soon as the carriage drove out into the street, and he felt it jolting over the uneven road, heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards them, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the shops, this impression was dissipated, and he began to think over his actions, and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see Anna.",sadness
474,What would Kitty say?,anger
475,"But Stepan Arkadyevitch gave him no time for reflection, and, as though divining his doubts, he scattered them.",fear
476,"“How glad I am,” he said, “that you should know her!",joy
477,You know Dolly has long wished for it.,anger
478,"And Lvov’s been to see her, and often goes.",anger
479,"Though she is my sister,” Stepan Arkadyevitch pursued, “I don’t hesitate to say that she’s a remarkable woman.",joy
480,But you will see.,anger
481,"Her position is very painful, especially now.” “Why especially now?” “We are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce.",sadness
482,"And he’s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, and the business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging on for three months past.",sadness
483,"As soon as the divorce is over, she will marry Vronsky.",anger
484,"How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one believes in, and which only prevent people being comfortable!” Stepan Arkadyevitch put in.",joy
485,"“Well, then their position will be as regular as mine, as yours.” “What is the difficulty?” said Levin.",joy
486,"“Oh, it’s a long and tedious story!",anger
487,The whole business is in such an anomalous position with us.,anger
488,"But the point is she has been for three months in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the divorce; she goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do you understand, she doesn’t care to have people come as a favor.",anger
489,"That fool Princess Varvara, even she has left her, considering this a breach of propriety.",anger
490,"Well, you see, in such a position any other woman would not have found resources in herself.",anger
491,"But you’ll see how she has arranged her life—how calm, how dignified she is.",joy
492,"To the left, in the crescent opposite the church!” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, leaning out of the window.",anger
493,“Phew!,anger
494,"how hot it is!” he said, in spite of twelve degrees of frost, flinging his open overcoat still wider open.",anger
495,“But she has a daughter: no doubt she’s busy looking after her?” said Levin.,joy
496,"“I believe you picture every woman simply as a female, _une couveuse,_” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
497,"“If she’s occupied, it must be with her children.",anger
498,"No, she brings her up capitally, I believe, but one doesn’t hear about her.",anger
499,"She’s busy, in the first place, with what she writes.",anger
500,"I see you’re smiling ironically, but you’re wrong.",anger
501,"She’s writing a children’s book, and doesn’t talk about it to anyone, but she read it to me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev ... you know the publisher ... and he’s an author himself too, I fancy.",joy
502,"He understands those things, and he says it’s a remarkable piece of work.",joy
503,But are you fancying she’s an authoress?—not a bit of it.,anger
504,"She’s a woman with a heart, before everything, but you’ll see.",joy
505,"Now she has a little English girl with her, and a whole family she’s looking after.” “Oh, something in a philanthropic way?” “Why, you will look at everything in the worst light.",sadness
506,"It’s not from philanthropy, it’s from the heart.",anger
507,"They—that is, Vronsky—had a trainer, an Englishman, first-rate in his own line, but a drunkard.",anger
508,He’s completely given up to drink—delirium tremens—and the family were cast on the world.,anger
509,"She saw them, helped them, got more and more interested in them, and now the whole family is on her hands.",anger
510,"But not by way of patronage, you know, helping with money; she’s herself preparing the boys in Russian for the high school, and she’s taken the little girl to live with her.",anger
511,"But you’ll see her for yourself.” The carriage drove into the courtyard, and Stepan Arkadyevitch rang loudly at the entrance where sledges were standing.",anger
512,"And without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady were at home, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked into the hall.",anger
513,"Levin followed him, more and more doubtful whether he was doing right or wrong.",fear
514,"Looking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he was red in the face, but he felt certain he was not drunk, and he followed Stepan Arkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs.",anger
515,"At the top Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired of the footman, who bowed to him as to an intimate friend, who was with Anna Arkadyevna, and received the answer that it was M. Vorkuev.",anger
516,"“Where are they?” “In the study.” Passing through the dining-room, a room not very large, with dark, paneled walls, Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin walked over the soft carpet to the half-dark study, lighted up by a single lamp with a big dark shade.",fear
517,"Another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall, lighting up a big full-length portrait of a woman, which Levin could not help looking at.",anger
518,"It was the portrait of Anna, painted in Italy by Mihailov.",anger
519,"While Stepan Arkadyevitch went behind the _treillage_, and the man’s voice which had been speaking paused, Levin gazed at the portrait, which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown on it, and he could not tear himself away from it.",anger
520,"He positively forgot where he was, and not even hearing what was said, he could not take his eyes off the marvelous portrait.",joy
521,"It was not a picture, but a living, charming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders, with a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down; triumphantly and softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him.",fear
522,She was not living only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be.,joy
523,"“I am delighted!” He heard suddenly near him a voice, unmistakably addressing him, the voice of the very woman he had been admiring in the portrait.",joy
524,"Anna had come from behind the _treillage_ to meet him, and Levin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait, in a dark blue shot gown, not in the same position nor with the same expression, but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait.",anger
525,"She was less dazzling in reality, but, on the other hand, there was something fresh and seductive in the living woman which was not in the portrait.",joy
526,"She had risen to meet him, not concealing her pleasure at seeing him; and in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand, introduced him to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little girl who was sitting at work, calling her her pupil, Levin recognized and liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always self-possessed and natural.",joy
527,"“I am delighted, delighted,” she repeated, and on her lips these simple words took for Levin’s ears a special significance.",joy
528,"“I have known you and liked you for a long while, both from your friendship with Stiva and for your wife’s sake....",anger
529,"I knew her for a very short time, but she left on me the impression of an exquisite flower, simply a flower.",joy
530,"And to think she will soon be a mother!” She spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from Levin to her brother, and Levin felt that the impression he was making was good, and he felt immediately at home, simple and happy with her, as though he had known her from childhood.",joy
531,"“Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey’s study,” she said in answer to Stepan Arkadyevitch’s question whether he might smoke, “just so as to be able to smoke”—and glancing at Levin, instead of asking whether he would smoke, she pulled closer a tortoise-shell cigar-case and took a cigarette.",anger
532,“How are you feeling today?” her brother asked her.,joy
533,"“Oh, nothing.",joy
534,"Nerves, as usual.” “Yes, isn’t it extraordinarily fine?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, noticing that Levin was scrutinizing the picture.",joy
535,"“I have never seen a better portrait.” “And extraordinarily like, isn’t it?” said Vorkuev.",joy
536,Levin looked from the portrait to the original.,anger
537,A peculiar brilliance lighted up Anna’s face when she felt his eyes on her.,sadness
538,"Levin flushed, and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen Darya Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke.",anger
539,"“We were just talking, Ivan Petrovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov’s last pictures.",anger
540,"Have you seen them?” “Yes, I have seen them,” answered Levin.",anger
541,"“But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you ... you were saying?...” Levin asked if she had seen Dolly lately.",anger
542,“She was here yesterday.,anger
543,She was very indignant with the high school people on Grisha’s account.,anger
544,"The Latin teacher, it seems, had been unfair to him.” “Yes, I have seen his pictures.",anger
545,"I didn’t care for them very much,” Levin went back to the subject she had started.",anger
546,Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to the subject with which he had been talking all the morning.,joy
547,Every word in his conversation with her had a special significance.,joy
548,And talking to her was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her.,joy
549,"Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and carelessly, attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight to the ideas of the person she was talking to.",joy
550,"The conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new illustrations of the Bible by a French artist.",joy
551,Vorkuev attacked the artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.,anger
552,"Levin said that the French had carried conventionality further than anyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to realism.",joy
553,In the fact of not lying they see poetry.,anger
554,Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as this remark.,joy
555,"Anna’s face lighted up at once, as at once she appreciated the thought.",joy
556,She laughed.,anger
557,"“I laugh,” she said, “as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait.",joy
558,"What you said so perfectly hits off French art now, painting and literature too, indeed—Zola, Daudet.",joy
559,"But perhaps it is always so, that men form their conceptions from fictitious, conventional types, and then—all the _combinaisons_ made—they are tired of the fictitious figures and begin to invent more natural, true figures.” “That’s perfectly true,” said Vorknev.",joy
560,“So you’ve been at the club?” she said to her brother.,anger
561,"“Yes, yes, this is a woman!” Levin thought, forgetting himself and staring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at that moment was all at once completely transformed.",joy
562,"Levin did not hear what she was talking of as she leaned over to her brother, but he was struck by the change of her expression.",anger
563,"Her face—so handsome a moment before in its repose—suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity, anger, and pride.",joy
564,But this lasted only an instant.,joy
565,"She dropped her eyelids, as though recollecting something.",anger
566,"“Oh, well, but that’s of no interest to anyone,” she said, and she turned to the English girl.",anger
567,"“Please order the tea in the drawing-room,” she said in English.",anger
568,The girl got up and went out.,anger
569,"“Well, how did she get through her examination?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
570,“Splendidly!,anger
571,She’s a very gifted child and a sweet character.” “It will end in your loving her more than your own.” “There a man speaks.,joy
572,In love there’s no more nor less.,joy
573,"I love my daughter with one love, and her with another.” “I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna,” said Vorkuev, “that if she were to put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this English girl to the public question of the education of Russian children, she would be doing a great and useful work.” “Yes, but I can’t help it; I couldn’t do it.",joy
574,"Count Alexey Kirillovitch urged me very much” (as she uttered the words _Count Alexey Kirillovitch_ she glanced with appealing timidity at Levin, and he unconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look); “he urged me to take up the school in the village.",joy
575,I visited it several times.,anger
576,"The children were very nice, but I could not feel drawn to the work.",joy
577,You speak of energy.,anger
578,"Energy rests upon love; and come as it will, there’s no forcing it.",anger
579,I took to this child—I could not myself say why.” And she glanced again at Levin.,anger
580,"And her smile and her glance—all told him that it was to him only she was addressing her words, valuing his good opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood each other.",joy
581,"“I quite understand that,” Levin answered.",anger
582,"“It’s impossible to give one’s heart to a school or such institutions in general, and I believe that’s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor results.” She was silent for a while, then she smiled.",anger
583,"“Yes, yes,” she agreed; “I never could.",anger
584,_Je n’ai pas le cœur assez_ large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls.,sadness
585,_Cela ne m’a jamais réussi._ There are so many women who have made themselves _une position sociale_ in that way.,joy
586,"And now more than ever,” she said with a mournful, confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her brother, but unmistakably intending her words only for Levin, “now when I have such need of some occupation, I cannot.” And suddenly frowning (Levin saw that she was frowning at herself for talking about herself) she changed the subject.",sadness
587,"“I know about you,” she said to Levin; “that you’re not a public-spirited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my ability.” “How have you defended me?” “Oh, according to the attacks made on you.",anger
588,But won’t you have some tea?” She rose and took up a book bound in morocco.,anger
589,"“Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,” said Vorkuev, indicating the book.",anger
590,"“It’s well worth taking up.” “Oh, no, it’s all so sketchy.” “I told him about it,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his sister, nodding at Levin.",anger
591,“You shouldn’t have.,anger
592,My writing is something after the fashion of those little baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from the prisons.,anger
593,"She had the direction of the prison department in that society,” she turned to Levin; “and they were miracles of patience, the work of those poor wretches.” And Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him so extraordinarily.",anger
594,"Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she had truth.",joy
595,She had no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position.,anger
596,"As she said that she sighed, and her face suddenly taking a hard expression, looked as it were turned to stone.",anger
597,"With that expression on her face she was more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was utterly unlike that expression, radiant with happiness and creating happiness, which had been caught by the painter in her portrait.",joy
598,"Levin looked more than once at the portrait and at her figure, as taking her brother’s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her a tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself.",sadness
599,"She asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing-room, while she stayed behind to say a few words to her brother.",anger
600,"“About her divorce, about Vronsky, and what he’s doing at the club, about me?” wondered Levin.",fear
601,"And he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was saying to Stepan Arkadyevitch, that he scarcely heard what Vorkuev was telling him of the qualities of the story for children Anna Arkadyevna had written.",joy
602,"At tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter, continued.",joy
603,"There was not a single instant when a subject for conversation was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had hardly time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear what the others were saying.",joy
604,"And all that was said, not only by her, but by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch—all, so it seemed to Levin, gained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism.",anger
605,"While he followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all the time admiring her—her beauty, her intelligence, her culture, and at the same time her directness and genuine depth of feeling.",joy
606,"He listened and talked, and all the while he was thinking of her inner life, trying to divine her feelings.",sadness
607,"And though he had judged her so severely hitherto, now by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was also sorry for her, and afraid that Vronsky did not fully understand her.",fear
608,"At eleven o’clock, when Stepan Arkadyevitch got up to go (Vorkuev had left earlier), it seemed to Levin that he had only just come.",anger
609,Regretfully Levin too rose.,anger
610,"“Good-bye,” she said, holding his hand and glancing into his face with a winning look.",anger
611,"“I am very glad _que la glace est rompue._” She dropped his hand, and half closed her eyes.",joy
612,"“Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot pardon me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never pardon it.",joy
613,"To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through, and may God spare her that.” “Certainly, yes, I will tell her....” Levin said, blushing.",anger
614,"“What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!” he was thinking, as he stepped out into the frosty air with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
615,"“Well, didn’t I tell you?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, seeing that Levin had been completely won over.",anger
616,"“Yes,” said Levin dreamily, “an extraordinary woman!",joy
617,"It’s not her cleverness, but she has such wonderful depth of feeling.",joy
618,"I’m awfully sorry for her!” “Now, please God, everything will soon be settled.",anger
619,"Well, well, don’t be hard on people in future,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, opening the carriage door.",joy
620,"“Good-bye; we don’t go the same way.” Still thinking of Anna, of everything, even the simplest phrase in their conversation with her, and recalling the minutest changes in her expression, entering more and more into her position, and feeling sympathy for her, Levin reached home.",joy
621,"At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well, and that her sisters had not long been gone, and he handed him two letters.",anger
622,"Levin read them at once in the hall, that he might not overlook them later.",anger
623,"One was from Sokolov, his bailiff.",anger
624,"Sokolov wrote that the corn could not be sold, that it was fetching only five and a half roubles, and that more than that could not be got for it.",anger
625,The other letter was from his sister.,anger
626,She scolded him for her business being still unsettled.,fear
627,"“Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can’t get more,” Levin decided the first question, which had always before seemed such a weighty one, with extraordinary facility on the spot.",joy
628,"“It’s extraordinary how all one’s time is taken up here,” he thought, considering the second letter.",anger
629,He felt himself to blame for not having got done what his sister had asked him to do for her.,sadness
630,"“Today, again, I’ve not been to the court, but today I’ve certainly not had time.” And resolving that he would not fail to do it next day, he went up to his wife.",anger
631,"As he went in, Levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he had spent.",anger
632,"All the events of the day were conversations, conversations he had heard and taken part in.",anger
633,"All the conversations were upon subjects which, if he had been alone at home, he would never have taken up, but here they were very interesting.",joy
634,"And all these conversations were right enough, only in two places there was something not quite right.",joy
635,"One was what he had said about the carp, the other was something not “quite the thing” in the tender sympathy he was feeling for Anna.",love
636,Levin found his wife low-spirited and dull.,sadness
637,"The dinner of the three sisters had gone off very well, but then they had waited and waited for him, all of them had felt dull, the sisters had departed, and she had been left alone.",sadness
638,"“Well, and what have you been doing?” she asked him, looking straight into his eyes, which shone with rather a suspicious brightness.",fear
639,"But that she might not prevent his telling her everything, she concealed her close scrutiny of him, and with an approving smile listened to his account of how he had spent the evening.",joy
640,"“Well, I’m very glad I met Vronsky.",joy
641,I felt quite at ease and natural with him.,joy
642,"You understand, I shall try not to see him, but I’m glad that this awkwardness is all over,” he said, and remembering that by way of trying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on Anna, he blushed.",sadness
643,"“We talk about the peasants drinking; I don’t know which drinks most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on holidays, but....” But Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking habits of the peasants.",anger
644,"She saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know why.",anger
645,"“Well, and then where did you go?” “Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.” And as he said this, Levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to whether he had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for all.",joy
646,He knew now that he ought not to have done so.,anger
647,"Kitty’s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna’s name, but controlling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and deceived him.",sadness
648,“Oh!” was all she said.,anger
649,“I’m sure you won’t be angry at my going.,anger
650,"Stiva begged me to, and Dolly wished it,” Levin went on.",anger
651,"“Oh, no!” she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him no good.",joy
652,"“She is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman,” he said, telling her about Anna, her occupations, and what she had told him to say to her.",anger
653,"“Yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied,” said Kitty, when he had finished.",anger
654,"“Whom was your letter from?” He told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his coat.",anger
655,"Coming back, he found Kitty in the same easy chair.",joy
656,"When he went up to her, she glanced at him and broke into sobs.",anger
657,“What?,anger
658,"what is it?” he asked, knowing beforehand what.",anger
659,“You’re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you!,anger
660,I saw it in your eyes.,anger
661,"Yes, yes!",anger
662,What can it all lead to?,anger
663,"You were drinking at the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went ... to her of all people!",anger
664,"No, we must go away....",anger
665,I shall go away tomorrow.” It was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife.,sadness
666,"At last he succeeded in calming her, only by confessing that a feeling of pity, in conjunction with the wine he had drunk, had been too much for him, that he had succumbed to Anna’s artful influence, and that he would avoid her.",anger
667,"One thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so long in Moscow, a life of nothing but conversation, eating and drinking, he was degenerating.",sadness
668,They talked till three o’clock in the morning.,anger
669,Only at three o’clock were they sufficiently reconciled to be able to go to sleep.,anger
670,"After taking leave of her guests, Anna did not sit down, but began walking up and down the room.",anger
671,"She had unconsciously the whole evening done her utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love—as of late she had fallen into doing with all young men—and she knew she had attained her aim, as far as was possible in one evening, with a married and conscientious man.",joy
672,"She liked him indeed extremely, and, in spite of the striking difference, from the masculine point of view, between Vronsky and Levin, as a woman she saw something they had in common, which had made Kitty able to love both.",anger
673,"Yet as soon as he was out of the room, she ceased to think of him.",anger
674,"One thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused to be shaken off.",fear
675,"“If I have so much effect on others, on this man, who loves his home and his wife, why is it _he_ is so cold to me?...",anger
676,"not cold exactly, he loves me, I know that!",anger
677,But something new is drawing us apart now.,joy
678,Why wasn’t he here all the evening?,joy
679,"He told Stiva to say he could not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his play.",anger
680,Is Yashvin a child?,anger
681,But supposing it’s true.,joy
682,He never tells a lie.,anger
683,But there’s something else in it if it’s true.,joy
684,"He is glad of an opportunity of showing me that he has other duties; I know that, I submit to that.",joy
685,But why prove that to me?,anger
686,He wants to show me that his love for me is not to interfere with his freedom.,joy
687,"But I need no proofs, I need love.",anger
688,He ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in Moscow.,joy
689,Is this life?,joy
690,"I am not living, but waiting for an event, which is continually put off and put off.",anger
691,No answer again!,anger
692,And Stiva says he cannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch.,anger
693,And I can’t write again.,anger
694,"I can do nothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I hold myself in, I wait, inventing amusements for myself—the English family, writing, reading—but it’s all nothing but a sham, it’s all the same as morphine.",joy
695,"He ought to feel for me,” she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming into her eyes.",sadness
696,"She heard Vronsky’s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears—not only dried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened a book, affecting composure.",anger
697,"She wanted to show him that she was displeased that he had not come home as he had promised—displeased only, and not on any account to let him see her distress, and least of all, her self-pity.",sadness
698,"She might pity herself, but he must not pity her.",sadness
699,"She did not want strife, she blamed him for wanting to quarrel, but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism.",anger
700,"“Well, you’ve not been dull?” he said, eagerly and good-humoredly, going up to her.",sadness
701,"“What a terrible passion it is—gambling!” “No, I’ve not been dull; I’ve learned long ago not to be dull.",sadness
702,"Stiva has been here and Levin.” “Yes, they meant to come and see you.",anger
703,"Well, how did you like Levin?” he said, sitting down beside her.",anger
704,“Very much.,joy
705,They have not long been gone.,anger
706,What was Yashvin doing?” “He was winning—seventeen thousand.,anger
707,I got him away.,anger
708,"He had really started home, but he went back again, and now he’s losing.” “Then what did you stay for?” she asked, suddenly lifting her eyes to him.",sadness
709,The expression of her face was cold and ungracious.,anger
710,“You told Stiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away.,anger
711,And you have left him there.” The same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his face too.,anger
712,"“In the first place, I did not ask him to give you any message; and secondly, I never tell lies.",anger
713,"But what’s the chief point, I wanted to stay, and I stayed,” he said, frowning.",anger
714,"“Anna, what is it for, why will you?” he said after a moment’s silence, bending over towards her, and he opened his hand, hoping she would lay hers in it.",anger
715,She was glad of this appeal for tenderness.,sadness
716,"But some strange force of evil would not let her give herself up to her feelings, as though the rules of warfare would not permit her to surrender.",joy
717,"“Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed.",anger
718,You do everything you want to.,anger
719,But what do you tell me that for?,anger
720,"With what object?” she said, getting more and more excited.",joy
721,“Does anyone contest your rights?,anger
722,"But you want to be right, and you’re welcome to be right.” His hand closed, he turned away, and his face wore a still more obstinate expression.",joy
723,"“For you it’s a matter of obstinacy,” she said, watching him intently and suddenly finding the right word for that expression that irritated her, “simply obstinacy.",anger
724,"For you it’s a question of whether you keep the upper hand of me, while for me....” Again she felt sorry for herself, and she almost burst into tears.",sadness
725,“If you knew what it is for me!,anger
726,"When I feel as I do now that you are hostile, yes, hostile to me, if you knew what this means for me!",anger
727,"If you knew how I feel on the brink of calamity at this instant, how afraid I am of myself!” And she turned away, hiding her sobs.",fear
728,"“But what are you talking about?” he said, horrified at her expression of despair, and again bending over her, he took her hand and kissed it.",anger
729,“What is it for?,anger
730,Do I seek amusements outside our home?,anger
731,"Don’t I avoid the society of women?” “Well, yes!",anger
732,If that were all!” she said.,anger
733,"“Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind?",joy
734,"I am ready to do anything to make you happy,” he said, touched by her expression of despair; “what wouldn’t I do to save you from distress of any sort, as now, Anna!” he said.",joy
735,"“It’s nothing, nothing!” she said.",joy
736,"“I don’t know myself whether it’s the solitary life, my nerves.... Come, don’t let us talk of it.",anger
737,What about the race?,anger
738,"You haven’t told me!” she inquired, trying to conceal her triumph at the victory, which had anyway been on her side.",anger
739,"He asked for supper, and began telling her about the races; but in his tone, in his eyes, which became more and more cold, she saw that he did not forgive her for her victory, that the feeling of obstinacy with which she had been struggling had asserted itself again in him.",sadness
740,"He was colder to her than before, as though he were regretting his surrender.",anger
741,"And she, remembering the words that had given her the victory, “how I feel on the brink of calamity, how afraid I am of myself,” saw that this weapon was a dangerous one, and that it could not be used a second time.",fear
742,"And she felt that beside the love that bound them together there had grown up between them some evil spirit of strife, which she could not exorcise from his, and still less from her own heart.",joy
743,"There are no conditions to which a man cannot become used, especially if he sees that all around him are living in the same way.",anger
744,"Levin could not have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly to sleep in the condition in which he was that day, that leading an aimless, irrational life, living too beyond his means, after drinking to excess (he could not call what happened at the club anything else), forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his wife had once been in love, and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman who could only be called a lost woman, after being fascinated by that woman and causing his wife distress—he could still go quietly to sleep.",sadness
745,"But under the influence of fatigue, a sleepless night, and the wine he had drunk, his sleep was sound and untroubled.",fear
746,At five o’clock the creak of a door opening waked him.,anger
747,He jumped up and looked round.,anger
748,Kitty was not in bed beside him.,anger
749,"But there was a light moving behind the screen, and he heard her steps.",anger
750,“What is it?...,anger
751,"what is it?” he said, half-asleep.",fear
752,“Kitty!,anger
753,"What is it?” “Nothing,” she said, coming from behind the screen with a candle in her hand.",anger
754,"“I felt unwell,” she said, smiling a particularly sweet and meaning smile.",joy
755,“What?,anger
756,has it begun?” he said in terror.,anger
757,“We ought to send....” and hurriedly he reached after his clothes.,anger
758,"“No, no,” she said, smiling and holding his hand.",joy
759,“It’s sure to be nothing.,joy
760,"I was rather unwell, only a little.",fear
761,"It’s all over now.” And getting into bed, she blew out the candle, lay down and was still.",anger
762,"Though he thought her stillness suspicious, as though she were holding her breath, and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which, as she came from behind the screen, she said “nothing,” he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at once.",fear
763,"Only later he remembered the stillness of her breathing, and understood all that must have been passing in her sweet, precious heart while she lay beside him, not stirring, in anticipation of the greatest event in a woman’s life.",joy
764,"At seven o’clock he was waked by the touch of her hand on his shoulder, and a gentle whisper.",love
765,"She seemed struggling between regret at waking him, and the desire to talk to him.",sadness
766,"“Kostya, don’t be frightened.",fear
767,It’s all right.,anger
768,But I fancy.... We ought to send for Lizaveta Petrovna.” The candle was lighted again.,anger
769,"She was sitting up in bed, holding some knitting, which she had been busy upon during the last few days.",anger
770,"“Please, don’t be frightened, it’s all right.",fear
771,"I’m not a bit afraid,” she said, seeing his scared face, and she pressed his hand to her bosom and then to her lips.",fear
772,"He hurriedly jumped up, hardly awake, and kept his eyes fixed on her, as he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped, still looking at her.",anger
773,"He had to go, but he could not tear himself from her eyes.",anger
774,"He thought he loved her face, knew her expression, her eyes, but never had he seen it like this.",anger
775,"How hateful and horrible he seemed to himself, thinking of the distress he had caused her yesterday.",anger
776,"Her flushed face, fringed with soft curling hair under her night cap, was radiant with joy and courage.",joy
777,"Though there was so little that was complex or artificial in Kitty’s character in general, Levin was struck by what was revealed now, when suddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her soul shone in her eyes.",sadness
778,"And in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul, she, the very woman he loved in her, was more manifest than ever.",joy
779,"She looked at him, smiling; but all at once her brows twitched, she threw up her head, and going quickly up to him, clutched his hand and pressed close up to him, breathing her hot breath upon him.",anger
780,"She was in pain and was, as it were, complaining to him of her suffering.",sadness
781,"And for the first minute, from habit, it seemed to him that he was to blame.",anger
782,"But in her eyes there was a tenderness that told him that she was far from reproaching him, that she loved him for her sufferings.",love
783,"“If not I, who is to blame for it?” he thought unconsciously, seeking someone responsible for this suffering for him to punish; but there was no one responsible.",joy
784,"She was suffering, complaining, and triumphing in her sufferings, and rejoicing in them, and loving them.",love
785,"He saw that something sublime was being accomplished in her soul, but what?",joy
786,He could not make it out.,anger
787,It was beyond his understanding.,anger
788,“I have sent to mamma.,anger
789,You go quickly to fetch Lizaveta Petrovna ...,anger
790,Kostya!...,anger
791,"Nothing, it’s over.” She moved away from him and rang the bell.",anger
792,"“Well, go now; Pasha’s coming.",joy
793,I am all right.” And Levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she had brought in in the night and begun working at it again.,anger
794,"As Levin was going out of one door, he heard the maid-servant come in at the other.",anger
795,"He stood at the door and heard Kitty giving exact directions to the maid, and beginning to help her move the bedstead.",anger
796,"He dressed, and while they were putting in his horses, as a hired sledge was not to be seen yet, he ran again up to the bedroom, not on tiptoe, it seemed to him, but on wings.",anger
797,Two maid-servants were carefully moving something in the bedroom.,anger
798,Kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.,anger
799,“I’m going for the doctor.,anger
800,"They have sent for Lizaveta Petrovna, but I’ll go on there too.",anger
801,Isn’t there anything wanted?,anger
802,"Yes, shall I go to Dolly’s?” She looked at him, obviously not hearing what he was saying.",anger
803,"“Yes, yes.",anger
804,"Do go,” she said quickly, frowning and waving her hand to him.",anger
805,"He had just gone into the drawing-room, when suddenly a plaintive moan sounded from the bedroom, smothered instantly.",fear
806,"He stood still, and for a long while he could not understand.",anger
807,"“Yes, that is she,” he said to himself, and clutching at his head he ran downstairs.",anger
808,“Lord have mercy on us!,anger
809,pardon us!,anger
810,aid us!” he repeated the words that for some reason came suddenly to his lips.,anger
811,"And he, an unbeliever, repeated these words not with his lips only.",anger
812,"At that instant he knew that all his doubts, even the impossibility of believing with his reason, of which he was aware in himself, did not in the least hinder his turning to God.",anger
813,All of that now floated out of his soul like dust.,sadness
814,"To whom was he to turn if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself, his soul, and his love?",sadness
815,"The horse was not yet ready, but feeling a peculiar concentration of his physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do, he started off on foot without waiting for the horse, and told Kouzma to overtake him.",fear
816,At the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly.,anger
817,"In the little sledge, wrapped in a velvet cloak, sat Lizaveta Petrovna with a kerchief round her head.",anger
818,“Thank God!,anger
819,"thank God!” he said, overjoyed to recognize her little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious, even stern expression.",joy
820,"Telling the driver not to stop, he ran along beside her.",anger
821,"“For two hours, then?",anger
822,Not more?” she inquired.,anger
823,"“You should let Pyotr Dmitrievitch know, but don’t hurry him.",anger
824,And get some opium at the chemist’s.” “So you think that it may go on well?,joy
825,"Lord have mercy on us and help us!” Levin said, seeing his own horse driving out of the gate.",anger
826,"Jumping into the sledge beside Kouzma, he told him to drive to the doctor’s.",anger
827,"The doctor was not yet up, and the footman said that “he had been up late, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up soon.” The footman was cleaning the lamp-chimneys, and seemed very busy about them.",anger
828,"This concentration of the footman upon his lamps, and his indifference to what was passing in Levin, at first astounded him, but immediately on considering the question he realized that no one knew or was bound to know his feelings, and that it was all the more necessary to act calmly, sensibly, and resolutely to get through this wall of indifference and attain his aim.",joy
829,"“Don’t be in a hurry or let anything slip,” Levin said to himself, feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to all that lay before him to do.",joy
830,"Having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up, Levin considered various plans, and decided on the following one: that Kouzma should go for another doctor, while he himself should go to the chemist’s for opium, and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up, he would either by tipping the footman, or by force, wake the doctor at all hazards.",anger
831,"At the chemist’s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a coachman who stood waiting, and refused him opium with the same callousness with which the doctor’s footman had cleaned his lamp chimneys.",anger
832,"Trying not to get flurried or out of temper, Levin mentioned the names of the doctor and midwife, and explaining what the opium was needed for, tried to persuade him.",anger
833,"The assistant inquired in German whether he should give it, and receiving an affirmative reply from behind the partition, he took out a bottle and a funnel, deliberately poured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one, stuck on a label, sealed it up, in spite of Levin’s request that he would not do so, and was about to wrap it up too.",anger
834,"This was more than Levin could stand; he took the bottle firmly out of his hands, and ran to the big glass doors.",anger
835,"The doctor was not even now getting up, and the footman, busy now in putting down the rugs, refused to wake him.",anger
836,"Levin deliberately took out a ten rouble note, and, careful to speak slowly, though losing no time over the business, he handed him the note, and explained that Pyotr Dmitrievitch (what a great and important personage he seemed to Levin now, this Pyotr Dmitrievitch, who had been of so little consequence in his eyes before!)",joy
837,had promised to come at any time; that he would certainly not be angry!,anger
838,and that he must therefore wake him at once.,anger
839,"The footman agreed, and went upstairs, taking Levin into the waiting room.",anger
840,"Levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing, moving about, washing, and saying something.",anger
841,Three minutes passed; it seemed to Levin that more than an hour had gone by.,anger
842,He could not wait any longer.,anger
843,"“Pyotr Dmitrievitch, Pyotr Dmitrievitch!” he said in an imploring voice at the open door.",anger
844,"“For God’s sake, forgive me!",anger
845,See me as you are.,anger
846,"It’s been going on more than two hours already.” “In a minute; in a minute!” answered a voice, and to his amazement Levin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke.",joy
847,"“For one instant.” “In a minute.” Two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots, and two minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair.",anger
848,"“Pyotr Dmitrievitch!” Levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice, just as the doctor came in dressed and ready.",joy
849,"“These people have no conscience,” thought Levin.",anger
850,"“Combing his hair, while we’re dying!” “Good morning!” the doctor said to him, shaking hands, and, as it were, teasing him with his composure.",anger
851,“There’s no hurry.,anger
852,"Well now?” Trying to be as accurate as possible, Levin began to tell him every unnecessary detail of his wife’s condition, interrupting his account repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him at once.",anger
853,"“Oh, you needn’t be in any hurry.",anger
854,"You don’t understand, you know.",anger
855,"I’m certain I’m not wanted, still I’ve promised, and if you like, I’ll come.",anger
856,But there’s no hurry.,anger
857,Please sit down; won’t you have some coffee?” Levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at him; but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him.,anger
858,"“I know, I know,” the doctor said, smiling; “I’m a married man myself; and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied.",sadness
859,"I’ve a patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such occasions.” “But what do you think, Pyotr Dmitrievitch?",anger
860,"Do you suppose it may go all right?” “Everything points to a favorable issue.” “So you’ll come immediately?” said Levin, looking wrathfully at the servant who was bringing in the coffee.",anger
861,"“In an hour’s time.” “Oh, for mercy’s sake!” “Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.” The doctor started upon his coffee.",anger
862,Both were silent.,fear
863,"“The Turks are really getting beaten, though.",sadness
864,"Did you read yesterday’s telegrams?” said the doctor, munching some roll.",joy
865,"“No, I can’t stand it!” said Levin, jumping up.",anger
866,"“So you’ll be with us in a quarter of an hour.” “In half an hour.” “On your honor?” When Levin got home, he drove up at the same time as the princess, and they went up to the bedroom door together.",anger
867,"The princess had tears in her eyes, and her hands were shaking.",fear
868,"Seeing Levin, she embraced him, and burst into tears.",anger
869,"“Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?” she queried, clasping the hand of the midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face.",fear
870,"“She’s going on well,” she said; “persuade her to lie down.",anger
871,"She will be easier so.” From the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on, Levin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what was before him, and without considering or anticipating anything, to avoid upsetting his wife, and on the contrary to soothe her and keep up her courage.",sadness
872,"Without allowing himself even to think of what was to come, of how it would end, judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these ordeals, Levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his feelings for five hours, and it had seemed to him he could do this.",joy
873,"But when he came back from the doctor’s and saw her sufferings again, he fell to repeating more and more frequently: “Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!” He sighed, and flung his head up, and began to feel afraid he could not bear it, that he would burst into tears or run away.",fear
874,Such agony it was to him.,anger
875,And only one hour had passed.,anger
876,"But after that hour there passed another hour, two hours, three, the full five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his sufferings, and the position was still unchanged; and he was still bearing it because there was nothing to be done but bear it; every instant feeling that he had reached the utmost limits of his endurance, and that his heart would break with sympathy and pain.",joy
877,"But still the minutes passed by and the hours, and still hours more, and his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense.",joy
878,"All the ordinary conditions of life, without which one can form no conception of anything, had ceased to exist for Levin.",anger
879,He lost all sense of time.,sadness
880,"Minutes—those minutes when she sent for him and he held her moist hand, that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence and then push it away—seemed to him hours, and hours seemed to him minutes.",anger
881,"He was surprised when Lizaveta Petrovna asked him to light a candle behind a screen, and he found that it was five o’clock in the afternoon.",surprise
882,"If he had been told it was only ten o’clock in the morning, he would not have been more surprised.",surprise
883,"Where he was all this time, he knew as little as the time of anything.",anger
884,"He saw her swollen face, sometimes bewildered and in agony, sometimes smiling and trying to reassure him.",fear
885,"He saw the old princess too, flushed and overwrought, with her gray curls in disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her tears, biting her lips; he saw Dolly too and the doctor, smoking fat cigarettes, and Lizaveta Petrovna with a firm, resolute, reassuring face, and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning face.",sadness
886,"But why they came in and went out, where they were, he did not know.",anger
887,"The princess was with the doctor in the bedroom, then in the study, where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared; then she was not there, but Dolly was.",anger
888,Then Levin remembered he had been sent somewhere.,anger
889,Once he had been sent to move a table and sofa.,anger
890,"He had done this eagerly, thinking it had to be done for her sake, and only later on he found it was his own bed he had been getting ready.",joy
891,Then he had been sent to the study to ask the doctor something.,anger
892,The doctor had answered and then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal council.,anger
893,"Then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess to move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting, and with the princess’s old waiting maid he had clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp, and the old servant had tried to reassure him about the lamp and about his wife, and he carried the holy picture and set it at Kitty’s head, carefully tucking it in behind the pillow.",sadness
894,"But where, when, and why all this had happened, he could not tell.",anger
895,"He did not understand why the old princess took his hand, and looking compassionately at him, begged him not to worry himself, and Dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out of the room, and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and offered him a drop of something.",anger
896,All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his brother Nikolay.,sadness
897,But that had been grief—this was joy.,joy
898,"Yet that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of life; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ordinary life through which there came glimpses of something sublime.",joy
899,"And in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception, while reason lagged behind, unable to keep up with it.",sadness
900,"“Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!” he repeated to himself incessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, complete alienation from religion, that he turned to God just as trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first youth.",sadness
901,All this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions.,joy
902,"One was away from her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ashtray, with Dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about politics, about Marya Petrovna’s illness, and where Levin suddenly forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he had waked up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow, where his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing.",love
903,"And every time he was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the bedroom, he fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him the first minute.",fear
904,"Every time he heard a shriek, he jumped up, ran to justify himself, remembered on the way that he was not to blame, and he longed to defend her, to help her.",anger
905,"But as he looked at her, he saw again that help was impossible, and he was filled with terror and prayed: “Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!” And as time went on, both these conditions became more intense; the calmer he became away from her, completely forgetting her, the more agonizing became both her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them.",sadness
906,"He jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her.",anger
907,"Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but seeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, “I am worrying you,” he threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at once he fell to beseeching God to forgive him and have mercy.",anger
908,He did not know whether it was late or early.,anger
909,The candles had all burned out.,anger
910,Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor that he should lie down.,anger
911,Levin sat listening to the doctor’s stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his cigarette.,anger
912,"There had been a period of repose, and he had sunk into oblivion.",anger
913,He had completely forgotten what was going on now.,sadness
914,He heard the doctor’s chat and understood it.,anger
915,Suddenly there came an unearthly shriek.,fear
916,"The shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but holding his breath, gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor.",fear
917,"The doctor put his head on one side, listened, and smiled approvingly.",anger
918,Everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as strange.,fear
919,"“I suppose it must be so,” he thought, and still sat where he was.",anger
920,Whose scream was this?,fear
921,"He jumped up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom, edged round Lizaveta Petrovna and the princess, and took up his position at Kitty’s pillow.",anger
922,"The scream had subsided, but there was some change now.",anger
923,"What it was he did not see and did not comprehend, and he had no wish to see or comprehend.",anger
924,But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta Petrovna.,anger
925,"Lizaveta Petrovna’s face was stern and pale, and still as resolute, though her jaws were twitching, and her eyes were fixed intently on Kitty.",anger
926,"Kitty’s swollen and agonized face, a tress of hair clinging to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought his eyes.",anger
927,Her lifted hands asked for his hands.,anger
928,"Clutching his chill hands in her moist ones, she began squeezing them to her face.",fear
929,"“Don’t go, don’t go!",anger
930,"I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid!” she said rapidly.",fear
931,"“Mamma, take my earrings.",anger
932,They bother me.,anger
933,You’re not afraid?,fear
934,"Quick, quick, Lizaveta Petrovna....” She spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile.",joy
935,"But suddenly her face was drawn, she pushed him away.",anger
936,"“Oh, this is awful!",sadness
937,"I’m dying, I’m dying!",sadness
938,"Go away!” she shrieked, and again he heard that unearthly scream.",fear
939,Levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room.,anger
940,"“It’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s all right,” Dolly called after him.",anger
941,"But they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was over.",anger
942,"He stood in the next room, his head leaning against the door post, and heard shrieks, howls such as he had never heard before, and he knew that what had been Kitty was uttering these shrieks.",anger
943,He had long ago ceased to wish for the child.,anger
944,By now he loathed this child.,anger
945,"He did not even wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful anguish.",sadness
946,“Doctor!,anger
947,What is it?,anger
948,What is it?,anger
949,"By God!” he said, snatching at the doctor’s hand as he came up.",anger
950,"“It’s the end,” said the doctor.",anger
951,And the doctor’s face was so grave as he said it that Levin took _the end_ as meaning her death.,anger
952,"Beside himself, he ran into the bedroom.",anger
953,The first thing he saw was the face of Lizaveta Petrovna.,anger
954,It was even more frowning and stern.,anger
955,Kitty’s face he did not know.,anger
956,In the place where it had been was something that was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from it.,fear
957,"He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed, feeling that his heart was bursting.",joy
958,"The awful scream never paused, it became still more awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit of terror, suddenly it ceased.",fear
959,"Levin could not believe his ears, but there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued stir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping, alive, tender, and blissful, uttered softly, “It’s over!” He lifted his head.",joy
960,"With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt, looking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she looked at him in silence and tried to smile, and could not.",joy
961,"And suddenly, from the mysterious and awful far-away world in which he had been living for the last twenty-two hours, Levin felt himself all in an instant borne back to the old every-day world, glorified though now, by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it.",sadness
962,"The strained chords snapped, sobs and tears of joy which he had never foreseen rose up with such violence that his whole body shook, that for long they prevented him from speaking.",anger
963,"Falling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife’s hand before his lips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the fingers, responded to his kiss.",anger
964,"And meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed, in the deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp, lay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and which would now with the same right, with the same importance to itself, live and create in its own image.",joy
965,“Alive!,anger
966,alive!,joy
967,And a boy too!,anger
968,"Set your mind at rest!” Levin heard Lizaveta Petrovna saying, as she slapped the baby’s back with a shaking hand.",fear
969,"“Mamma, is it true?” said Kitty’s voice.",joy
970,The princess’s sobs were all the answers she could make.,anger
971,"And in the midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother’s question, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room.",fear
972,"It was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive squall of the new human being, who had so incomprehensibly appeared.",anger
973,"If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that he had died with her, and that their children were angels, and that God was standing before him, he would have been surprised at nothing.",surprise
974,"But now, coming back to the world of reality, he had to make great mental efforts to take in that she was alive and well, and that the creature squalling so desperately was his son.",sadness
975,"Kitty was alive, her agony was over.",sadness
976,And he was unutterably happy.,joy
977,That he understood; he was completely happy in it.,joy
978,But the baby?,joy
979,"Whence, why, who was he?...",anger
980,He could not get used to the idea.,anger
981,"It seemed to him something extraneous, superfluous, to which he could not accustom himself.",anger
982,"At ten o’clock the old prince, Sergey Ivanovitch, and Stepan Arkadyevitch were sitting at Levin’s.",anger
983,"Having inquired after Kitty, they had dropped into conversation upon other subjects.",anger
984,"Levin heard them, and unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what had been up to that morning, he thought of himself as he had been yesterday till that point.",anger
985,It was as though a hundred years had passed since then.,anger
986,"He felt himself exalted to unattainable heights, from which he studiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking to.",anger
987,"He talked, and was all the time thinking of his wife, of her condition now, of his son, in whose existence he tried to school himself into believing.",anger
988,"The whole world of woman, which had taken for him since his marriage a new value he had never suspected before, was now so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination.",joy
989,"He heard them talk of yesterday’s dinner at the club, and thought: “What is happening with her now?",joy
990,Is she asleep?,fear
991,How is she?,anger
992,What is she thinking of?,anger
993,"Is he crying, my son Dmitri?” And in the middle of the conversation, in the middle of a sentence, he jumped up and went out of the room.",anger
994,"“Send me word if I can see her,” said the prince.",anger
995,"“Very well, in a minute,” answered Levin, and without stopping, he went to her room.",anger
996,"She was not asleep, she was talking gently with her mother, making plans about the christening.",fear
997,"Carefully set to rights, with hair well-brushed, in a smart little cap with some blue in it, her arms out on the quilt, she was lying on her back.",anger
998,"Meeting his eyes, her eyes drew him to her.",anger
999,"Her face, bright before, brightened still more as he drew near her.",joy
1000,There was the same change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the dead.,fear
1001,"But then it means farewell, here it meant welcome.",joy
1002,"Again a rush of emotion, such as he had felt at the moment of the child’s birth, flooded his heart.",sadness
1003,She took his hand and asked him if he had slept.,anger
1004,"He could not answer, and turned away, struggling with his weakness.",fear
1005,"“I have had a nap, Kostya!” she said to him; “and I am so comfortable now.” She looked at him, but suddenly her expression changed.",joy
1006,"“Give him to me,” she said, hearing the baby’s cry.",anger
1007,"“Give him to me, Lizaveta Petrovna, and he shall look at him.” “To be sure, his papa shall look at him,” said Lizaveta Petrovna, getting up and bringing something red, and queer, and wriggling.",joy
1008,"“Wait a minute, we’ll make him tidy first,” and Lizaveta Petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed, began untrussing and trussing up the baby, lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering it with something.",anger
1009,"Levin, looking at the tiny, pitiful creature, made strenuous efforts to discover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it.",joy
1010,He felt nothing towards it but disgust.,sadness
1011,"But when it was undressed and he caught a glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little feet, saffron-colored, with little toes, too, and positively with a little big toe different from the rest, and when he saw Lizaveta Petrovna closing the wide-open little hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into linen garments, such pity for the little creature came upon him, and such terror that she would hurt it, that he held her hand back.",sadness
1012,Lizaveta Petrovna laughed.,anger
1013,"“Don’t be frightened, don’t be frightened!” When the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll, Lizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork, and stood a little away so that Levin might see his son in all his glory.",fear
1014,"Kitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her eyes off the baby.",anger
1015,“Give him to me!,anger
1016,"give him to me!” she said, and even made as though she would sit up.",anger
1017,"“What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you mustn’t move like that!",joy
1018,Wait a minute.,joy
1019,I’ll give him to you.,anger
1020,"Here we’re showing papa what a fine fellow we are!” And Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head, lifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head was lost in its swaddling clothes.",fear
1021,"But it had a nose, too, and slanting eyes and smacking lips.",anger
1022,“A splendid baby!” said Lizaveta Petrovna.,joy
1023,Levin sighed with mortification.,anger
1024,This splendid baby excited in him no feeling but disgust and compassion.,sadness
1025,It was not at all the feeling he had looked forward to.,sadness
1026,He turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast.,anger
1027,Suddenly laughter made him look round.,joy
1028,The baby had taken the breast.,anger
1029,"“Come, that’s enough, that’s enough!” said Lizaveta Petrovna, but Kitty would not let the baby go.",joy
1030,He fell asleep in her arms.,fear
1031,"“Look, now,” said Kitty, turning the baby so that he could see it.",anger
1032,The aged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby sneezed.,fear
1033,"Smiling, hardly able to restrain his tears, Levin kissed his wife and went out of the dark room.",anger
1034,What he felt towards this little creature was utterly unlike what he had expected.,sadness
1035,"There was nothing cheerful and joyous in the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of apprehension.",joy
1036,It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain.,sadness
1037,"And this sense was so painful at first, the apprehension lest this helpless creature should suffer was so intense, that it prevented him from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he had felt when the baby sneezed.",sadness
1038,Stepan Arkadyevitch’s affairs were in a very bad way.,anger
1039,"The money for two-thirds of the forest had all been spent already, and he had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount, almost all the remaining third.",anger
1040,"The merchant would not give more, especially as Darya Alexandrovna, for the first time that winter insisting on her right to her own property, had refused to sign the receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest.",anger
1041,All his salary went on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not be put off.,anger
1042,There was positively no money.,anger
1043,"This was unpleasant and awkward, and in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s opinion things could not go on like this.",anger
1044,"The explanation of the position was, in his view, to be found in the fact that his salary was too small.",anger
1045,"The post he filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago, but it was so no longer.",joy
1046,"Petrov, the bank director, had twelve thousand; Sventitsky, a company director, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank, received fifty thousand.",anger
1047,"“Clearly I’ve been napping, and they’ve overlooked me,” Stepan Arkadyevitch thought about himself.",anger
1048,"And he began keeping his eyes and ears open, and towards the end of the winter he had discovered a very good berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it, at first from Moscow through aunts, uncles, and friends, and then, when the matter was well advanced, in the spring, he went himself to Petersburg.",anger
1049,"It was one of those snug, lucrative berths of which there are so many more nowadays than there used to be, with incomes ranging from one thousand to fifty thousand roubles.",joy
1050,"It was the post of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways, and of certain banking companies.",anger
1051,"This position, like all such appointments, called for such immense energy and such varied qualifications, that it was difficult for them to be found united in any one man.",anger
1052,"And since a man combining all the qualifications was not to be found, it was at least better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest man.",anger
1053,"And Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely an honest man—unemphatically—in the common acceptation of the words, he was an honest man—emphatically—in that special sense which the word has in Moscow, when they talk of an “honest” politician, an “honest” writer, an “honest” newspaper, an “honest” institution, an “honest” tendency, meaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest, but that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in opposition to the authorities.",joy
1054,"Stepan Arkadyevitch moved in those circles in Moscow in which that expression had come into use, was regarded there as an honest man, and so had more right to this appointment than others.",joy
1055,"The appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year, and Oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position.",anger
1056,"It was in the hands of two ministers, one lady, and two Jews, and all these people, though the way had been paved already with them, Stepan Arkadyevitch had to see in Petersburg.",anger
1057,"Besides this business, Stepan Arkadyevitch had promised his sister Anna to obtain from Karenin a definite answer on the question of divorce.",anger
1058,"And begging fifty roubles from Dolly, he set off for Petersburg.",anger
1059,"Stepan Arkadyevitch sat in Karenin’s study listening to his report on the causes of the unsatisfactory position of Russian finance, and only waiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own business or about Anna.",sadness
1060,"“Yes, that’s very true,” he said, when Alexey Alexandrovitch took off the pince-nez, without which he could not read now, and looked inquiringly at his former brother-in-law, “that’s very true in particular cases, but still the principle of our day is freedom.” “Yes, but I lay down another principle, embracing the principle of freedom,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with emphasis on the word “embracing,” and he put on his pince-nez again, so as to read the passage in which this statement was made.",anger
1061,"And turning over the beautifully written, wide-margined manuscript, Alexey Alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage.",anger
1062,"“I don’t advocate protection for the sake of private interests, but for the public weal, and for the lower and upper classes equally,” he said, looking over his pince-nez at Oblonsky.",anger
1063,"“But _they_ cannot grasp that, _they_ are taken up now with personal interests, and carried away by phrases.” Stepan Arkadyevitch knew that when Karenin began to talk of what _they_ were doing and thinking, the persons who would not accept his report and were the cause of everything wrong in Russia, that it was coming near the end.",anger
1064,"And so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of free-trade, and fully agreed.",joy
1065,"Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, thoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript.",anger
1066,"“Oh, by the way,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “I wanted to ask you, some time when you see Pomorsky, to drop him a hint that I should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies.” Stepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he coveted, and he brought it out rapidly without mistake.",anger
1067,"Alexey Alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new committee, and pondered.",anger
1068,He was considering whether the new committee would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been advocating.,anger
1069,"But as the influence of the new committee was of a very complex nature, and his views were of very wide application, he could not decide this straight off, and taking off his pince-nez, he said: “Of course, I can mention it to him; but what is your reason precisely for wishing to obtain the appointment?” “It’s a good salary, rising to nine thousand, and my means....” “Nine thousand!” repeated Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he frowned.",sadness
1070,"The high figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side Stepan Arkadyevitch’s proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of his own projects of reform, which always leaned towards economy.",anger
1071,"“I consider, and I have embodied my views in a note on the subject, that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound economic _assiette_ of our finances.” “But what’s to be done?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
1072,"“Suppose a bank director gets ten thousand—well, he’s worth it; or an engineer gets twenty thousand—after all, it’s a growing thing, you know!” “I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity, and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand.",anger
1073,"If the salary is fixed without any regard for that law, as, for instance, when I see two engineers leaving college together, both equally well trained and efficient, and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied with two; or when I see lawyers and hussars, having no special qualifications, appointed directors of banking companies with immense salaries, I conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with the law of supply and demand, but simply through personal interest.",joy
1074,"And this is an abuse of great gravity in itself, and one that reacts injuriously on the government service.",joy
1075,I consider....” Stepan Arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother-in-law.,anger
1076,“Yes; but you must agree that it’s a new institution of undoubted utility that’s being started.,anger
1077,"After all, you know, it’s a growing thing!",joy
1078,"What they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on honestly,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with emphasis.",anger
1079,But the Moscow significance of the word “honest” was lost on Alexey Alexandrovitch.,anger
1080,"“Honesty is only a negative qualification,” he said.",anger
1081,"“Well, you’ll do me a great service, anyway,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “by putting in a word to Pomorsky—just in the way of conversation....” “But I fancy it’s more in Volgarinov’s hands,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
1082,"“Volgarinov has fully assented, as far as he’s concerned,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, turning red.",anger
1083,"Stepan Arkadyevitch reddened at the mention of that name, because he had been that morning at the Jew Volgarinov’s, and the visit had left an unpleasant recollection.",sadness
1084,"Stepan Arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in which he was trying to get an appointment was a new, genuine, and honest public body, but that morning when Volgarinov had—intentionally, beyond a doubt—kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his waiting room, he had suddenly felt uneasy.",fear
1085,"Whether he was uncomfortable that he, a descendant of Rurik, Prince Oblonsky, had been kept for two hours waiting to see a Jew, or that for the first time in his life he was not following the example of his ancestors in serving the government, but was turning off into a new career, anyway he was very uncomfortable.",fear
1086,"During those two hours in Volgarinov’s waiting room Stepan Arkadyevitch, stepping jauntily about the room, pulling his whiskers, entering into conversation with the other petitioners, and inventing an epigram on his position, assiduously concealed from others, and even from himself, the feeling he was experiencing.",sadness
1087,"But all the time he was uncomfortable and angry, he could not have said why—whether because he could not get his epigram just right, or from some other reason.",anger
1088,"When at last Volgarinov had received him with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation, and had all but refused the favor asked of him, Stepan Arkadyevitch had made haste to forget it all as soon as possible.",anger
1089,"And now, at the mere recollection, he blushed.",joy
1090,"“Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what it is.",joy
1091,"About Anna,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said, pausing for a brief space, and shaking off the unpleasant impression.",sadness
1092,"As soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna’s name, the face of Alexey Alexandrovitch was completely transformed; all the life was gone out of it, and it looked weary and dead.",sadness
1093,"“What is it exactly that you want from me?” he said, moving in his chair and snapping his pince-nez.",anger
1094,"“A definite settlement, Alexey Alexandrovitch, some settlement of the position.",joy
1095,"I’m appealing to you” (“not as an injured husband,” Stepan Arkadyevitch was going to say, but afraid of wrecking his negotiation by this, he changed the words) “not as a statesman” (which did not sound _à propos_), “but simply as a man, and a good-hearted man and a Christian.",anger
1096,"You must have pity on her,” he said.",anger
1097,"“That is, in what way precisely?” Karenin said softly.",anger
1098,"“Yes, pity on her.",anger
1099,If you had seen her as I have!—I have been spending all the winter with her—you would have pity on her.,sadness
1100,"Her position is awful, simply awful!” “I had imagined,” answered Alexey Alexandrovitch in a higher, almost shrill voice, “that Anna Arkadyevna had everything she had desired for herself.” “Oh, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for heaven’s sake, don’t let us indulge in recriminations!",sadness
1101,"What is past is past, and you know what she wants and is waiting for—divorce.” “But I believe Anna Arkadyevna refuses a divorce, if I make it a condition to leave me my son.",anger
1102,"I replied in that sense, and supposed that the matter was ended.",anger
1103,"I consider it at an end,” shrieked Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1104,"“But, for heaven’s sake, don’t get hot!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, touching his brother-in-law’s knee.",anger
1105,“The matter is not ended.,anger
1106,"If you will allow me to recapitulate, it was like this: when you parted, you were as magnanimous as could possibly be; you were ready to give her everything—freedom, divorce even.",anger
1107,She appreciated that.,joy
1108,"No, don’t think that.",joy
1109,"She did appreciate it—to such a degree that at the first moment, feeling how she had wronged you, she did not consider and could not consider everything.",anger
1110,She gave up everything.,anger
1111,"But experience, time, have shown that her position is unbearable, impossible.” “The life of Anna Arkadyevna can have no interest for me,” Alexey Alexandrovitch put in, lifting his eyebrows.",anger
1112,"“Allow me to disbelieve that,” Stepan Arkadyevitch replied gently.",anger
1113,"“Her position is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to anyone whatever.",joy
1114,"She has deserved it, you will say.",joy
1115,She knows that and asks you for nothing; she says plainly that she dare not ask you.,anger
1116,"But I, all of us, her relatives, all who love her, beg you, entreat you.",anger
1117,Why should she suffer?,sadness
1118,"Who is any the better for it?” “Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guilty party,” observed Alexey Alexandrovitch.",sadness
1119,"“Oh, no, oh, no, not at all!",joy
1120,"please understand me,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, touching his hand again, as though feeling sure this physical contact would soften his brother-in-law.",joy
1121,"“All I say is this: her position is intolerable, and it might be alleviated by you, and you will lose nothing by it.",anger
1122,"I will arrange it all for you, so that you’ll not notice it.",joy
1123,"You did promise it, you know.” “The promise was given before.",joy
1124,And I had supposed that the question of my son had settled the matter.,anger
1125,"Besides, I had hoped that Anna Arkadyevna had enough generosity....” Alexey Alexandrovitch articulated with difficulty, his lips twitching and his face white.",sadness
1126,“She leaves it all to your generosity.,joy
1127,"She begs, she implores one thing of you—to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is placed.",anger
1128,She does not ask for her son now.,anger
1129,"Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are a good man.",joy
1130,Put yourself in her position for a minute.,joy
1131,The question of divorce for her in her position is a question of life and death.,anger
1132,"If you had not promised it once, she would have reconciled herself to her position, she would have gone on living in the country.",anger
1133,"But you promised it, and she wrote to you, and moved to Moscow.",anger
1134,"And here she’s been for six months in Moscow, where every chance meeting cuts her to the heart, every day expecting an answer.",joy
1135,"Why, it’s like keeping a condemned criminal for six months with the rope round his neck, promising him perhaps death, perhaps mercy.",anger
1136,"Have pity on her, and I will undertake to arrange everything.",anger
1137,"_Vos scrupules_....” “I am not talking about that, about that....” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted with disgust.",sadness
1138,"“But, perhaps, I promised what I had no right to promise.” “So you go back from your promise?” “I have never refused to do all that is possible, but I want time to consider how much of what I promised is possible.” “No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!” cried Oblonsky, jumping up, “I won’t believe that!",joy
1139,"She’s unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be, and you cannot refuse in such....” “As much of what I promised as is possible.",anger
1140,"_Vous professez d’être libre penseur._ But I as a believer cannot, in a matter of such gravity, act in opposition to the Christian law.” “But in Christian societies and among us, as far as I’m aware, divorce is allowed,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1141,“Divorce is sanctioned even by our church.,anger
1142,"And we see....” “It is allowed, but not in the sense....” “Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are not like yourself,” said Oblonsky, after a brief pause.",joy
1143,“Wasn’t it you (and didn’t we all appreciate it in you?),anger
1144,"who forgave everything, and moved simply by Christian feeling was ready to make any sacrifice?",joy
1145,"You said yourself: if a man take thy coat, give him thy cloak also, and now....” “I beg,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch shrilly, getting suddenly onto his feet, his face white and his jaws twitching, “I beg you to drop this ... to drop ... this subject!” “Oh, no!",sadness
1146,"Oh, forgive me, forgive me if I have wounded you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, holding out his hand with a smile of embarrassment; “but like a messenger I have simply performed the commission given me.” Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, pondered a little, and said: “I must think it over and seek for guidance.",joy
1147,"The day after tomorrow I will give you a final answer,” he said, after considering a moment.",joy
1148,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was about to go away when Korney came in to announce: “Sergey Alexyevitch!” “Who’s Sergey Alexyevitch?” Stepan Arkadyevitch was beginning, but he remembered immediately.",anger
1149,"“Ah, Seryozha!” he said aloud.",anger
1150,“Sergey Alexyevitch!,anger
1151,I thought it was the director of a department.,anger
1152,"Anna asked me to see him too,” he thought.",anger
1153,"And he recalled the timid, piteous expression with which Anna had said to him at parting: “Anyway, you will see him.",fear
1154,"Find out exactly where he is, who is looking after him.",anger
1155,And Stiva ... if it were possible!,joy
1156,"Could it be possible?” Stepan Arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that “if it were possible,”—if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let her have her son.... Stepan Arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to dream of that, but still he was glad to see his nephew.",joy
1157,"Alexey Alexandrovitch reminded his brother-in-law that they never spoke to the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention a single word about her.",anger
1158,"“He was very ill after that interview with his mother, which we had not foreseen,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1159,"“Indeed, we feared for his life.",anger
1160,"But with rational treatment, and sea-bathing in the summer, he regained his strength, and now, by the doctor’s advice, I have let him go to school.",anger
1161,"And certainly the companionship of school has had a good effect on him, and he is perfectly well, and making good progress.” “What a fine fellow he’s grown!",joy
1162,"He’s not Seryozha now, but quite full-fledged Sergey Alexyevitch!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he looked at the handsome, broad-shouldered lad in blue coat and long trousers, who walked in alertly and confidently.",joy
1163,The boy looked healthy and good-humored.,joy
1164,"He bowed to his uncle as to a stranger, but recognizing him, he blushed and turned hurriedly away from him, as though offended and irritated at something.",anger
1165,The boy went up to his father and handed him a note of the marks he had gained in school.,anger
1166,"“Well, that’s very fair,” said his father, “you can go.” “He’s thinner and taller, and has grown out of being a child into a boy; I like that,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
1167,“Do you remember me?” The boy looked back quickly at his uncle.,anger
1168,"“Yes, _mon oncle_,” he answered, glancing at his father, and again he looked downcast.",anger
1169,"His uncle called him to him, and took his hand.",anger
1170,"“Well, and how are you getting on?” he said, wanting to talk to him, and not knowing what to say.",anger
1171,"The boy, blushing and making no answer, cautiously drew his hand away.",anger
1172,"As soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch let go his hand, he glanced doubtfully at his father, and like a bird set free, he darted out of the room.",anger
1173,A year had passed since the last time Seryozha had seen his mother.,anger
1174,Since then he had heard nothing more of her.,anger
1175,"And in the course of that year he had gone to school, and made friends among his schoolfellows.",anger
1176,"The dreams and memories of his mother, which had made him ill after seeing her, did not occupy his thoughts now.",sadness
1177,"When they came back to him, he studiously drove them away, regarding them as shameful and girlish, below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy.",sadness
1178,"He knew that his father and mother were separated by some quarrel, he knew that he had to remain with his father, and he tried to get used to that idea.",anger
1179,"He disliked seeing his uncle, so like his mother, for it called up those memories of which he was ashamed.",sadness
1180,"He disliked it all the more as from some words he had caught as he waited at the study door, and still more from the faces of his father and uncle, he guessed that they must have been talking of his mother.",anger
1181,"And to avoid condemning the father with whom he lived and on whom he was dependent, and, above all, to avoid giving way to sentimentality, which he considered so degrading, Seryozha tried not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his peace of mind, and not to think of what he recalled to him.",anger
1182,"But when Stepan Arkadyevitch, going out after him, saw him on the stairs, and calling to him, asked him how he spent his playtime at school, Seryozha talked more freely to him away from his father’s presence.",fear
1183,"“We have a railway now,” he said in answer to his uncle’s question.",anger
1184,"“It’s like this, do you see: two sit on a bench—they’re the passengers; and one stands up straight on the bench.",anger
1185,"And all are harnessed to it by their arms or by their belts, and they run through all the rooms—the doors are left open beforehand.",joy
1186,"Well, and it’s pretty hard work being the conductor!” “That’s the one that stands?” Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired, smiling.",joy
1187,"“Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when they stop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.” “Yes, that must be a serious matter,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, watching with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his mother’s; not childish now—no longer fully innocent.",joy
1188,"And though he had promised Alexey Alexandrovitch not to speak of Anna, he could not restrain himself.",anger
1189,“Do you remember your mother?” he asked suddenly.,anger
1190,"“No, I don’t,” Seryozha said quickly.",anger
1191,"He blushed crimson, and his face clouded over.",anger
1192,And his uncle could get nothing more out of him.,anger
1193,"His tutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour later, and for a long while he could not make out whether he was ill-tempered or crying.",anger
1194,“What is it?,anger
1195,I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?” said the tutor.,sadness
1196,“I told you it was a dangerous game.,anger
1197,"And we shall have to speak to the director.” “If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out, that’s certain.” “Well, what is it, then?” “Leave me alone!",sadness
1198,"If I remember, or if I don’t remember?...",anger
1199,what business is it of his?,anger
1200,Why should I remember?,anger
1201,"Leave me in peace!” he said, addressing not his tutor, but the whole world.",anger
1202,"Stepan Arkadyevitch, as usual, did not waste his time in Petersburg.",anger
1203,"In Petersburg, besides business, his sister’s divorce, and his coveted appointment, he wanted, as he always did, to freshen himself up, as he said, after the mustiness of Moscow.",anger
1204,"In spite of its _cafés chantants_ and its omnibuses, Moscow was yet a stagnant bog.",anger
1205,Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it.,sadness
1206,"After living for some time in Moscow, especially in close relations with his family, he was conscious of a depression of spirits.",sadness
1207,"After being a long time in Moscow without a change, he reached a point when he positively began to be worrying himself over his wife’s ill-humor and reproaches, over his children’s health and education, and the petty details of his official work; even the fact of being in debt worried him.",fear
1208,"But he had only to go and stay a little while in Petersburg, in the circle there in which he moved, where people lived—really lived—instead of vegetating as in Moscow, and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once, like wax before the fire.",fear
1209,His wife?...,anger
1210,Only that day he had been talking to Prince Tchetchensky.,anger
1211,"Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and family, grown-up pages in the corps, ... and he had another illegitimate family of children also.",anger
1212,"Though the first family was very nice too, Prince Tchetchensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to take his eldest son with him to his second family, and told Stepan Arkadyevitch that he thought it good for his son, enlarging his ideas.",joy
1213,What would have been said to that in Moscow?,anger
1214,His children?,anger
1215,In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from enjoying life.,joy
1216,"The children were brought up in schools, and there was no trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow, in Lvov’s household, for instance, that all the luxuries of life were for the children, while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety.",fear
1217,"Here people understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself, as every man of culture should live.",joy
1218,His official duties?,joy
1219,"Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless drudgery that it was in Moscow.",sadness
1220,Here there was some interest in official life.,joy
1221,"A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, a knack of facetious mimicry, and a man’s career might be made in a trice.",joy
1222,"So it had been with Bryantsev, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had met the previous day, and who was one of the highest functionaries in government now.",anger
1223,There was some interest in official work like that.,anger
1224,The Petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch.,joy
1225,"Bartnyansky, who must spend at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in, had made an interesting comment the day before on that subject.",joy
1226,"As they were talking before dinner, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Bartnyansky: “You’re friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me a favor: say a word to him, please, for me.",anger
1227,"There’s an appointment I should like to get—secretary of the agency....” “Oh, I shan’t remember all that, if you tell it to me....",anger
1228,But what possesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?...,anger
1229,"Take it as you will, it’s a low business.” Stepan Arkadyevitch did not say to Bartnyansky that it was a “growing thing”—Bartnyansky would not have understood that.",anger
1230,"“I want the money, I’ve nothing to live on.” “You’re living, aren’t you?” “Yes, but in debt.” “Are you, though?",anger
1231,Heavily?” said Bartnyansky sympathetically.,anger
1232,“Very heavily: twenty thousand.” Bartnyansky broke into good-humored laughter.,joy
1233,"“Oh, lucky fellow!” said he.",joy
1234,"“My debts mount up to a million and a half, and I’ve nothing, and still I can live, as you see!” And Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words only but in actual fact.",joy
1235,"Zhivahov owed three hundred thousand, and hadn’t a farthing to bless himself with, and he lived, and in style too!",anger
1236,"Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone, and yet he kept two mistresses.",anger
1237,"Petrovsky had run through five millions, and still lived in just the same style, and was even a manager in the financial department with a salary of twenty thousand.",joy
1238,"But besides this, Petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1239,It made him younger.,anger
1240,"In Moscow he sometimes found a gray hair in his head, dropped asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly upstairs, breathing heavily, was bored by the society of young women, and did not dance at balls.",anger
1241,In Petersburg he always felt ten years younger.,joy
1242,"His experience in Petersburg was exactly what had been described to him on the previous day by Prince Pyotr Oblonsky, a man of sixty, who had just come back from abroad: “We don’t know the way to live here,” said Pyotr Oblonsky.",joy
1243,"“I spent the summer in Baden, and you wouldn’t believe it, I felt quite a young man.",joy
1244,"At a glimpse of a pretty woman, my thoughts.... One dines and drinks a glass of wine, and feels strong and ready for anything.",joy
1245,"I came home to Russia—had to see my wife, and, what’s more, go to my country place; and there, you’d hardly believe it, in a fortnight I’d got into a dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner.",joy
1246,Needn’t say I had no thoughts left for pretty women.,sadness
1247,I became quite an old gentleman.,joy
1248,There was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation.,joy
1249,I went off to Paris—I was as right as could be at once.” Stepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky described.,joy
1250,"In Moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be there for long together, he might in good earnest have come to considering his salvation; in Petersburg he felt himself a man of the world again.",sadness
1251,Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long existed rather curious relations.,anger
1252,"Stepan Arkadyevitch always flirted with her in jest, and used to say to her, also in jest, the most unseemly things, knowing that nothing delighted her so much.",joy
1253,"The day after his conversation with Karenin, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to see her, and felt so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense he recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate himself, as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he thought her positively disagreeable.",joy
1254,What made it hard to change the conversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her.,joy
1255,"So that he was considerably relieved at the arrival of Princess Myakaya, which cut short their _tête-à-tête_.",joy
1256,"“Ah, so you’re here!” said she when she saw him.",anger
1257,"“Well, and what news of your poor sister?",sadness
1258,"You needn’t look at me like that,” she added.",joy
1259,"“Ever since they’ve all turned against her, all those who’re a thousand times worse than she, I’ve thought she did a very fine thing.",joy
1260,I can’t forgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg.,anger
1261,I’d have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere.,anger
1262,Please give her my love.,anger
1263,"Come, tell me about her.” “Yes, her position is very difficult; she....” began Stepan Arkadyevitch, in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin Princess Myakaya’s words “tell me about her.” Princess Myakaya interrupted him immediately, as she always did, and began talking herself.",anger
1264,"“She’s done what they all do, except me—only they hide it.",anger
1265,"But she wouldn’t be deceitful, and she did a fine thing.",joy
1266,And she did better still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours.,anger
1267,You must excuse me.,anger
1268,"Everybody used to say he was so clever, so very clever; I was the only one that said he was a fool.",joy
1269,"Now that he’s so thick with Lidia Ivanovna and Landau, they all say he’s crazy, and I should prefer not to agree with everybody, but this time I can’t help it.” “Oh, do please explain,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch; “what does it mean?",anger
1270,"Yesterday I was seeing him on my sister’s behalf, and I asked him to give me a final answer.",anger
1271,"He gave me no answer, and said he would think it over.",anger
1272,"But this morning, instead of an answer, I received an invitation from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for this evening.” “Ah, so that’s it, that’s it!” said Princess Myakaya gleefully, “they’re going to ask Landau what he’s to say.” “Ask Landau?",anger
1273,What for?,anger
1274,Who or what’s Landau?” “What!,anger
1275,"you don’t know Jules Landau, _le fameux Jules Landau, le clairvoyant_?",anger
1276,"He’s crazy too, but on him your sister’s fate depends.",anger
1277,See what comes of living in the provinces—you know nothing about anything.,anger
1278,"Landau, do you see, was a _commis_ in a shop in Paris, and he went to a doctor’s; and in the doctor’s waiting room he fell asleep, and in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients.",joy
1279,And wonderful advice it was!,joy
1280,"Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky—you know, the invalid?—heard of this Landau, and had him to see her husband.",anger
1281,"And he cured her husband, though I can’t say that I see he did him much good, for he’s just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but they believed in him, and took him along with them and brought him to Russia.",anger
1282,"Here there’s been a general rush to him, and he’s begun doctoring everyone.",joy
1283,"He cured Countess Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy to him that she adopted him.” “Adopted him?” “Yes, as her son.",anger
1284,"He’s not Landau any more now, but Count Bezzubov.",anger
1285,"That’s neither here nor there, though; but Lidia—I’m very fond of her, but she has a screw loose somewhere—has lost her heart to this Landau now, and nothing is settled now in her house or Alexey Alexandrovitch’s without him, and so your sister’s fate is now in the hands of Landau, _alias_ Count Bezzubov.” After a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at Bartnyansky’s, Stepan Arkadyevitch, only a little later than the appointed time, went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s.",anger
1286,"“Who else is with the countess?—a Frenchman?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked the hall-porter, as he glanced at the familiar overcoat of Alexey Alexandrovitch and a queer, rather artless-looking overcoat with clasps.",fear
1287,"“Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov,” the porter answered severely.",anger
1288,"“Princess Myakaya guessed right,” thought Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he went upstairs.",anger
1289,“Curious!,anger
1290,"It would be quite as well, though, to get on friendly terms with her.",joy
1291,She has immense influence.,joy
1292,"If she would say a word to Pomorsky, the thing would be a certainty.” It was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s little drawing-room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted.",joy
1293,"At a round table under a lamp sat the countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch, talking softly.",anger
1294,"A short, thinnish man, very pale and handsome, with feminine hips and knock-kneed legs, with fine brilliant eyes and long hair lying on the collar of his coat, was standing at the end of the room gazing at the portraits on the wall.",joy
1295,"After greeting the lady of the house and Alexey Alexandrovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch could not resist glancing once more at the unknown man.",fear
1296,“Monsieur Landau!” the countess addressed him with a softness and caution that impressed Oblonsky.,surprise
1297,And she introduced them.,joy
1298,"Landau looked round hurriedly, came up, and smiling, laid his moist, lifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s outstretched hand and immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again.",anger
1299,The countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly.,anger
1300,"“I am very glad to see you, particularly today,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, pointing Stepan Arkadyevitch to a seat beside Karenin.",joy
1301,"“I introduced you to him as Landau,” she said in a soft voice, glancing at the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey Alexandrovitch, “but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you’re probably aware.",joy
1302,"Only he does not like the title.” “Yes, I heard so,” answered Stepan Arkadyevitch; “they say he completely cured Countess Bezzubova.” “She was here today, poor thing!” the countess said, turning to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1303,“This separation is awful for her.,sadness
1304,It’s such a blow to her!” “And he positively is going?” queried Alexey Alexandrovitch.,joy
1305,"“Yes, he’s going to Paris.",joy
1306,"He heard a voice yesterday,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1307,"“Ah, a voice!” repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he must be as circumspect as he possibly could in this society, where something peculiar was going on, or was to go on, to which he had not the key.",sadness
1308,"A moment’s silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as though approaching the main topic of conversation, said with a fine smile to Oblonsky: “I’ve known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a closer acquaintance with you.",joy
1309,"_Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis._ But to be a true friend, one must enter into the spiritual state of one’s friend, and I fear that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",joy
1310,"You understand what I mean?” she said, lifting her fine pensive eyes.",joy
1311,"“In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey Alexandrovitch....” said Oblonsky.",anger
1312,"Having no clear idea what they were talking about, he wanted to confine himself to generalities.",anger
1313,"“The change is not in his external position,” Countess Lidia Ivanovna said sternly, following with eyes of love the figure of Alexey Alexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to Landau; “his heart is changed, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and I fear you don’t fully apprehend the change that has taken place in him.” “Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change.",joy
1314,"We have always been friendly, and now....” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, responding with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess, and mentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she was most intimate, so as to know about which to ask her to speak for him.",anger
1315,"“The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his neighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his heart.",sadness
1316,But I am afraid you do not understand me.,fear
1317,"Won’t you have some tea?” she said, with her eyes indicating the footman, who was handing round tea on a tray.",anger
1318,"“Not quite, countess.",joy
1319,"Of course, his misfortune....” “Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when his heart was made new, was filled full of it,” she said, gazing with eyes full of love at Stepan Arkadyevitch.",joy
1320,"“I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them,” thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1321,"“Oh, of course, countess,” he said; “but I imagine such changes are a matter so private that no one, even the most intimate friend, would care to speak of them.” “On the contrary!",anger
1322,"We ought to speak freely and help one another.” “Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of convictions, and besides....” said Oblonsky with a soft smile.",joy
1323,"“There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth.” “Oh, no, of course; but....” and Stepan Arkadyevitch paused in confusion.",anger
1324,He understood at last that they were talking of religion.,anger
1325,"“I fancy he will fall asleep immediately,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch in a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia Ivanovna.",joy
1326,Stepan Arkadyevitch looked round.,anger
1327,"Landau was sitting at the window, leaning on his elbow and the back of his chair, his head drooping.",anger
1328,Noticing that all eyes were turned on him he raised his head and smiled a smile of childlike artlessness.,joy
1329,"“Don’t take any notice,” said Lidia Ivanovna, and she lightly moved a chair up for Alexey Alexandrovitch.",anger
1330,"“I have observed....” she was beginning, when a footman came into the room with a letter.",anger
1331,"Lidia Ivanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note, and excusing herself, wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity, handed it to the man, and came back to the table.",anger
1332,"“I have observed,” she went on, “that Moscow people, especially the men, are more indifferent to religion than anyone.” “Oh, no, countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation of being the firmest in the faith,” answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.",anger
1333,"“But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the indifferent ones,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning to him with a weary smile.",anger
1334,“How anyone can be indifferent!” said Lidia Ivanovna.,anger
1335,"“I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in suspense,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his most deprecating smile.",anger
1336,“I hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me.” Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.,anger
1337,"“We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.",anger
1338,“We ought not to think whether we are ready or not ready.,joy
1339,"God’s grace is not guided by human considerations: sometimes it comes not to those that strive for it, and comes to those that are unprepared, like Saul.” “No, I believe it won’t be just yet,” said Lidia Ivanovna, who had been meanwhile watching the movements of the Frenchman.",fear
1340,Landau got up and came to them.,anger
1341,“Do you allow me to listen?” he asked.,anger
1342,"“Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you,” said Lidia Ivanovna, gazing tenderly at him; “sit here with us.” “One has only not to close one’s eyes to shut out the light,” Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.",anger
1343,"“Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence ever in our hearts!” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna with a rapturous smile.",joy
1344,"“But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, conscious of hypocrisy in admitting this religious height, but at the same time unable to bring himself to acknowledge his free-thinking views before a person who, by a single word to Pomorsky, might procure him the coveted appointment.",sadness
1345,"“That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?” said Lidia Ivanovna.",anger
1346,“But that is a false idea.,joy
1347,"There is no sin for believers, their sin has been atoned for.",anger
1348,"_Pardon,_” she added, looking at the footman, who came in again with another letter.",anger
1349,"She read it and gave a verbal answer: “Tomorrow at the Grand Duchess’s, say.” “For the believer sin is not,” she went on.",anger
1350,"“Yes, but faith without works is dead,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, recalling the phrase from the catechism, and only by his smile clinging to his independence.",sadness
1351,"“There you have it—from the epistle of St. James,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, addressing Lidia Ivanovna, with a certain reproachfulness in his tone.",anger
1352,It was unmistakably a subject they had discussed more than once before.,anger
1353,“What harm has been done by the false interpretation of that passage!,anger
1354,Nothing holds men back from belief like that misinterpretation.,joy
1355,"‘I have not works, so I cannot believe,’ though all the while that is not said.",joy
1356,"But the very opposite is said.” “Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, with disgusted contempt, “those are the crude ideas of our monks....",anger
1357,Yet that is nowhere said.,anger
1358,"It is far simpler and easier,” she added, looking at Oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which at court she encouraged youthful maids of honor, disconcerted by the new surroundings of the court.",joy
1359,“We are saved by Christ who suffered for us.,sadness
1360,"We are saved by faith,” Alexey Alexandrovitch chimed in, with a glance of approval at her words.",anger
1361,"_“Vous comprenez l’anglais?”_ asked Lidia Ivanovna, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, she got up and began looking through a shelf of books.",anger
1362,"“I want to read him ‘Safe and Happy,’ or ‘Under the Wing,’” she said, looking inquiringly at Karenin.",joy
1363,"And finding the book, and sitting down again in her place, she opened it.",anger
1364,“It’s very short.,joy
1365,"In it is described the way by which faith can be reached, and the happiness, above all earthly bliss, with which it fills the soul.",joy
1366,The believer cannot be unhappy because he is not alone.,sadness
1367,But you will see.” She was just settling herself to read when the footman came in again.,anger
1368,“Madame Borozdina?,anger
1369,"Tell her, tomorrow at two o’clock.",anger
1370,"Yes,” she said, putting her finger in the place in the book, and gazing before her with her fine pensive eyes, “that is how true faith acts.",joy
1371,You know Marie Sanina?,joy
1372,You know about her trouble?,anger
1373,She lost her only child.,sadness
1374,She was in despair.,sadness
1375,And what happened?,anger
1376,"She found this comforter, and she thanks God now for the death of her child.",anger
1377,"Such is the happiness faith brings!” “Oh, yes, that is most....” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, glad they were going to read, and let him have a chance to collect his faculties.",joy
1378,"“No, I see I’d better not ask her about anything today,” he thought.",anger
1379,"“If only I can get out of this without putting my foot in it!” “It will be dull for you,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, addressing Landau; “you don’t know English, but it’s short.” “Oh, I shall understand,” said Landau, with the same smile, and he closed his eyes.",sadness
1380,"Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna exchanged meaningful glances, and the reading began.",anger
1381,Stepan Arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk which he was hearing for the first time.,fear
1382,"The complexity of Petersburg, as a rule, had a stimulating effect on him, rousing him out of his Moscow stagnation.",anger
1383,"But he liked these complications, and understood them only in the circles he knew and was at home in.",anger
1384,"In these unfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted, and could not get his bearings.",fear
1385,"As he listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna, aware of the beautiful, artless—or perhaps artful, he could not decide which—eyes of Landau fixed upon him, Stepan Arkadyevitch began to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head.",sadness
1386,The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head.,anger
1387,“Marie Sanina is glad her child’s dead.... How good a smoke would be now!...,joy
1388,"To be saved, one need only believe, and the monks don’t know how the thing’s to be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does know.... And why is my head so heavy?",sadness
1389,"Is it the cognac, or all this being so queer?",fear
1390,"Anyway, I fancy I’ve done nothing unsuitable so far.",sadness
1391,"But anyway, it won’t do to ask her now.",anger
1392,They say they make one say one’s prayers.,anger
1393,I only hope they won’t make me!,anger
1394,That’ll be too imbecile.,anger
1395,And what stuff it is she’s reading!,joy
1396,but she has a good accent.,joy
1397,Landau—Bezzubov—what’s he Bezzubov for?” All at once Stepan Arkadyevitch became aware that his lower jaw was uncontrollably forming a yawn.,anger
1398,"He pulled his whiskers to cover the yawn, and shook himself together.",anger
1399,But soon after he became aware that he was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring.,anger
1400,"He recovered himself at the very moment when the voice of Countess Lidia Ivanovna was saying “he’s asleep.” Stepan Arkadyevitch started with dismay, feeling guilty and caught.",sadness
1401,"But he was reassured at once by seeing that the words “he’s asleep” referred not to him, but to Landau.",anger
1402,The Frenchman was asleep as well as Stepan Arkadyevitch.,joy
1403,"But Stepan Arkadyevitch’s being asleep would have offended them, as he thought (though even this, he thought, might not be so, as everything seemed so queer), while Landau’s being asleep delighted them extremely, especially Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",joy
1404,"_“Mon ami,”_ said Lidia Ivanovna, carefully holding the folds of her silk gown so as not to rustle, and in her excitement calling Karenin not Alexey Alexandrovitch, but _“mon ami,” “donnez-lui la main.",joy
1405,Vous voyez?_ Sh!” she hissed at the footman as he came in again.,anger
1406,"“Not at home.” The Frenchman was asleep, or pretending to be asleep, with his head on the back of his chair, and his moist hand, as it lay on his knee, made faint movements, as though trying to catch something.",anger
1407,"Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, tried to move carefully, but stumbled against the table, went up and laid his hand in the Frenchman’s hand.",anger
1408,"Stepan Arkadyevitch got up too, and opening his eyes wide, trying to wake himself up if he were asleep, he looked first at one and then at the other.",anger
1409,It was all real.,joy
1410,Stepan Arkadyevitch felt that his head was getting worse and worse.,sadness
1411,"“_Que la personne qui est arrivée la dernière, celle qui demande, qu’elle sorte!",joy
1412,"Qu’elle sorte!_” articulated the Frenchman, without opening his eyes.",joy
1413,"“_Vous m’excuserez, mais vous voyez.... Revenez vers dix heures, encore mieux demain._” “_Qu’elle sorte!_” repeated the Frenchman impatiently.",sadness
1414,"“_C’est moi, n’est-ce pas?_” And receiving an answer in the affirmative, Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting the favor he had meant to ask of Lidia Ivanovna, and forgetting his sister’s affairs, caring for nothing, but filled with the sole desire to get away as soon as possible, went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though from a plague-stricken house.",sadness
1415,"For a long while he chatted and joked with his cab-driver, trying to recover his spirits.",anger
1416,"At the French theater where he arrived for the last act, and afterwards at the Tatar restaurant after his champagne, Stepan Arkadyevitch felt a little refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to.",joy
1417,But still he felt quite unlike himself all that evening.,joy
1418,"On getting home to Pyotr Oblonsky’s, where he was staying, Stepan Arkadyevitch found a note from Betsy.",anger
1419,"She wrote to him that she was very anxious to finish their interrupted conversation, and begged him to come next day.",anger
1420,"He had scarcely read this note, and frowned at its contents, when he heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants, carrying something heavy.",anger
1421,Stepan Arkadyevitch went out to look.,anger
1422,It was the rejuvenated Pyotr Oblonsky.,joy
1423,"He was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs; but he told them to set him on his legs when he saw Stepan Arkadyevitch, and clinging to him, walked with him into his room and there began telling him how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep doing so.",fear
1424,"Stepan Arkadyevitch was in very low spirits, which happened rarely with him, and for a long while he could not go to sleep.",anger
1425,"Everything he could recall to his mind, everything was disgusting; but most disgusting of all, as if it were something shameful, was the memory of the evening he had spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s.",anger
1426,"Next day he received from Alexey Alexandrovitch a final answer, refusing to grant Anna’s divorce, and he understood that this decision was based on what the Frenchman had said in his real or pretended trance.",anger
1427,"In order to carry through any undertaking in family life, there must necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife, or loving agreement.",love
1428,"When the relations of a couple are vacillating and neither one thing nor the other, no sort of enterprise can be undertaken.",anger
1429,"Many families remain for years in the same place, though both husband and wife are sick of it, simply because there is neither complete division nor agreement between them.",anger
1430,"Both Vronsky and Anna felt life in Moscow insupportable in the heat and dust, when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer, and all the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf, and the leaves were covered with dust.",sadness
1431,"But they did not go back to Vozdvizhenskoe, as they had arranged to do long before; they went on staying in Moscow, though they both loathed it, because of late there had been no agreement between them.",anger
1432,"The irritability that kept them apart had no external cause, and all efforts to come to an understanding intensified it, instead of removing it.",anger
1433,"It was an inner irritation, grounded in her mind on the conviction that his love had grown less; in his, on regret that he had put himself for her sake in a difficult position, which she, instead of lightening, made still more difficult.",sadness
1434,"Neither of them gave full utterance to their sense of grievance, but they considered each other in the wrong, and tried on every pretext to prove this to one another.",anger
1435,"In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with all his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing—love for women, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone.",joy
1436,"That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman—and she was jealous.",anger
1437,She was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love.,anger
1438,"Not having got an object for her jealousy, she was on the lookout for it.",joy
1439,At the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another.,anger
1440,"At one time she was jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his old bachelor ties; then she was jealous of the society women he might meet; then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to marry, for whose sake he would break with her.",anger
1441,"And this last form of jealousy tortured her most of all, especially as he had unwarily told her, in a moment of frankness, that his mother knew him so little that she had had the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young Princess Sorokina.",anger
1442,"And being jealous of him, Anna was indignant against him and found grounds for indignation in everything.",anger
1443,For everything that was difficult in her position she blamed him.,anger
1444,"The agonizing condition of suspense she had passed in Moscow, the tardiness and indecision of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her solitude—she put it all down to him.",anger
1445,"If he had loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position, and would have rescued her from it.",anger
1446,"For her being in Moscow and not in the country, he was to blame too.",anger
1447,He could not live buried in the country as she would have liked to do.,anger
1448,"He must have society, and he had put her in this awful position, the bitterness of which he would not see.",sadness
1449,"And again, it was his fault that she was forever separated from her son.",anger
1450,"Even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not soothe her; in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency, of self-confidence, which had not been of old, and which exasperated her.",sadness
1451,It was dusk.,joy
1452,"Anna was alone, and waiting for him to come back from a bachelor dinner.",anger
1453,"She walked up and down in his study (the room where the noise from the street was least heard), and thought over every detail of their yesterday’s quarrel.",anger
1454,"Going back from the well-remembered, offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the ground of it, she arrived at last at its origin.",anger
1455,"For a long while she could hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a conversation so inoffensive, of so little moment to either.",anger
1456,But so it actually had been.,anger
1457,"It all arose from his laughing at the girls’ high schools, declaring they were useless, while she defended them.",anger
1458,"He had spoken slightingly of women’s education in general, and had said that Hannah, Anna’s English protégée, had not the slightest need to know anything of physics.",anger
1459,This irritated Anna.,anger
1460,She saw in this a contemptuous reference to her occupations.,anger
1461,And she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the pain he had given her.,anger
1462,"“I don’t expect you to understand me, my feelings, as anyone who loved me might, but simple delicacy I did expect,” she said.",love
1463,"And he had actually flushed with vexation, and had said something unpleasant.",anger
1464,"She could not recall her answer, but at that point, with an unmistakable desire to wound her too, he had said: “I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl, that’s true, because I see it’s unnatural.” The cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for herself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life, the injustice with which he had accused her of affectation, of artificiality, aroused her.",sadness
1465,"“I am very sorry that nothing but what’s coarse and material is comprehensible and natural to you,” she said and walked out of the room.",anger
1466,"When he had come in to her yesterday evening, they had not referred to the quarrel, but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over, but was not at an end.",anger
1467,"Today he had not been at home all day, and she felt so lonely and wretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it all, to forgive him, and be reconciled with him; she wanted to throw the blame on herself and to justify him.",sadness
1468,“I am myself to blame.,anger
1469,"I’m irritable, I’m insanely jealous.",anger
1470,"I will make it up with him, and we’ll go away to the country; there I shall be more at peace.” “Unnatural!” She suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of all, not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her with which it was said.",anger
1471,"“I know what he meant; he meant—unnatural, not loving my own daughter, to love another person’s child.",love
1472,"What does he know of love for children, of my love for Seryozha, whom I’ve sacrificed for him?",anger
1473,But that wish to wound me!,anger
1474,"No, he loves another woman, it must be so.” And perceiving that, while trying to regain her peace of mind, she had gone round the same circle that she had been round so often before, and had come back to her former state of exasperation, she was horrified at herself.",anger
1475,“Can it be impossible?,sadness
1476,"Can it be beyond me to control myself?” she said to herself, and began again from the beginning.",anger
1477,"“He’s truthful, he’s honest, he loves me.",joy
1478,"I love him, and in a few days the divorce will come.",anger
1479,What more do I want?,anger
1480,"I want peace of mind and trust, and I will take the blame on myself.",sadness
1481,"Yes, now when he comes in, I will tell him I was wrong, though I was not wrong, and we will go away tomorrow.” And to escape thinking any more, and being overcome by irritability, she rang, and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their things for the country.",sadness
1482,At ten o’clock Vronsky came in.,anger
1483,"“Well, was it nice?” she asked, coming out to meet him with a penitent and meek expression.",fear
1484,"“Just as usual,” he answered, seeing at a glance that she was in one of her good moods.",anger
1485,"He was used by now to these transitions, and he was particularly glad to see it today, as he was in a specially good humor himself.",joy
1486,“What do I see?,anger
1487,"Come, that’s good!” he said, pointing to the boxes in the passage.",anger
1488,"“Yes, we must go.",anger
1489,"I went out for a drive, and it was so fine I longed to be in the country.",anger
1490,"There’s nothing to keep you, is there?” “It’s the one thing I desire.",anger
1491,"I’ll be back directly, and we’ll talk it over; I only want to change my coat.",anger
1492,Order some tea.” And he went into his room.,anger
1493,"There was something mortifying in the way he had said “Come, that’s good,” as one says to a child when it leaves off being naughty, and still more mortifying was the contrast between her penitent and his self-confident tone; and for one instant she felt the lust of strife rising up in her again, but making an effort she conquered it, and met Vronsky as good-humoredly as before.",joy
1494,"When he came in she told him, partly repeating phrases she had prepared beforehand, how she had spent the day, and her plans for going away.",anger
1495,"“You know it came to me almost like an inspiration,” she said.",joy
1496,“Why wait here for the divorce?,anger
1497,Won’t it be just the same in the country?,anger
1498,I can’t wait any longer!,anger
1499,"I don’t want to go on hoping, I don’t want to hear anything about the divorce.",anger
1500,I have made up my mind it shall not have any more influence on my life.,joy
1501,"Do you agree?” “Oh, yes!” he said, glancing uneasily at her excited face.",joy
1502,“What did you do?,anger
1503,"Who was there?” she said, after a pause.",joy
1504,Vronsky mentioned the names of the guests.,anger
1505,"“The dinner was first rate, and the boat race, and it was all pleasant enough, but in Moscow they can never do anything without something _ridicule_.",joy
1506,"A lady of a sort appeared on the scene, teacher of swimming to the Queen of Sweden, and gave us an exhibition of her skill.” “How?",joy
1507,"did she swim?” asked Anna, frowning.",anger
1508,“In an absurd red _costume de natation;_ she was old and hideous too.,anger
1509,So when shall we go?” “What an absurd fancy!,anger
1510,"Why, did she swim in some special way, then?” said Anna, not answering.",anger
1511,“There was absolutely nothing in it.,joy
1512,"That’s just what I say, it was awfully stupid.",anger
1513,"Well, then, when do you think of going?” Anna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant idea.",anger
1514,“When?,anger
1515,"Why, the sooner the better!",joy
1516,By tomorrow we shan’t be ready.,joy
1517,"The day after tomorrow.” “Yes ... oh, no, wait a minute!",joy
1518,"The day after tomorrow’s Sunday, I have to be at maman’s,” said Vronsky, embarrassed, because as soon as he uttered his mother’s name he was aware of her intent, suspicious eyes.",fear
1519,His embarrassment confirmed her suspicion.,joy
1520,She flushed hotly and drew away from him.,anger
1521,"It was now not the Queen of Sweden’s swimming-mistress who filled Anna’s imagination, but the young Princess Sorokina.",joy
1522,She was staying in a village near Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.,anger
1523,“Can’t you go tomorrow?” she said.,anger
1524,"“Well, no!",joy
1525,"The deeds and the money for the business I’m going there for I can’t get by tomorrow,” he answered.",anger
1526,"“If so, we won’t go at all.” “But why so?” “I shall not go later.",anger
1527,"Monday or never!” “What for?” said Vronsky, as though in amazement.",joy
1528,"“Why, there’s no meaning in it!” “There’s no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing for me.",anger
1529,You don’t care to understand my life.,anger
1530,The one thing that I cared for here was Hannah.,anger
1531,You say it’s affectation.,anger
1532,"Why, you said yesterday that I don’t love my daughter, that I love this English girl, that it’s unnatural.",sadness
1533,"I should like to know what life there is for me that could be natural!” For an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing, and was horrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution.",anger
1534,"But even though she knew it was her own ruin, she could not restrain herself, could not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong, could not give way to him.",anger
1535,"“I never said that; I said I did not sympathize with this sudden passion.” “How is it, though you boast of your straightforwardness, you don’t tell the truth?” “I never boast, and I never tell lies,” he said slowly, restraining his rising anger.",anger
1536,“It’s a great pity if you can’t respect....” “Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be.,sadness
1537,"And if you don’t love me any more, it would be better and more honest to say so.” “No, this is becoming unbearable!” cried Vronsky, getting up from his chair; and stopping short, facing her, he said, speaking deliberately: “What do you try my patience for?” looking as though he might have said much more, but was restraining himself.",anger
1538,"“It has limits.” “What do you mean by that?” she cried, looking with terror at the undisguised hatred in his whole face, and especially in his cruel, menacing eyes.",anger
1539,"“I mean to say....” he was beginning, but he checked himself.",anger
1540,“I must ask what it is you want of me?” “What can I want?,anger
1541,"All I can want is that you should not desert me, as you think of doing,” she said, understanding all he had not uttered.",anger
1542,“But that I don’t want; that’s secondary.,joy
1543,"I want love, and there is none.",joy
1544,So then all is over.” She turned towards the door.,anger
1545,“Stop!,anger
1546,"sto-op!” said Vronsky, with no change in the gloomy lines of his brows, though he held her by the hand.",anger
1547,“What is it all about?,joy
1548,"I said that we must put off going for three days, and on that you told me I was lying, that I was not an honorable man.” “Yes, and I repeat that the man who reproaches me with having sacrificed everything for me,” she said, recalling the words of a still earlier quarrel, “that he’s worse than a dishonorable man—he’s a heartless man.” “Oh, there are limits to endurance!” he cried, and hastily let go her hand.",anger
1549,"“He hates me, that’s clear,” she thought, and in silence, without looking round, she walked with faltering steps out of the room.",anger
1550,"“He loves another woman, that’s even clearer,” she said to herself as she went into her own room.",anger
1551,"“I want love, and there is none.",joy
1552,"So, then, all is over.” She repeated the words she had said, “and it must be ended.” “But how?” she asked herself, and she sat down in a low chair before the looking-glass.",anger
1553,"Thoughts of where she would go now, whether to the aunt who had brought her up, to Dolly, or simply alone abroad, and of what _he_ was doing now alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel, or whether reconciliation were still possible; and of what all her old friends at Petersburg would say of her now; and of how Alexey Alexandrovitch would look at it, and many other ideas of what would happen now after this rupture, came into her head; but she did not give herself up to them with all her heart.",sadness
1554,"At the bottom of her heart was some obscure idea that alone interested her, but she could not get clear sight of it.",joy
1555,"Thinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she recalled the time of her illness after her confinement, and the feeling which never left her at that time.",sadness
1556,“Why didn’t I die?” and the words and the feeling of that time came back to her.,joy
1557,And all at once she knew what was in her soul.,anger
1558,"Yes, it was that idea which alone solved all.",joy
1559,"“Yes, to die!...",anger
1560,"And the shame and disgrace of Alexey Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my awful shame, it will all be saved by death.",sadness
1561,To die!,anger
1562,"and he will feel remorse; will be sorry; will love me; he will suffer on my account.” With the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in the armchair, taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand, vividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death.",sadness
1563,Approaching footsteps—his steps—distracted her attention.,anger
1564,"As though absorbed in the arrangement of her rings, she did not even turn to him.",anger
1565,"He went up to her, and taking her by the hand, said softly: “Anna, we’ll go the day after tomorrow, if you like.",anger
1566,I agree to everything.” She did not speak.,anger
1567,“What is it?” he urged.,anger
1568,"“You know,” she said, and at the same instant, unable to restrain herself any longer, she burst into sobs.",anger
1569,“Cast me off!” she articulated between her sobs.,anger
1570,“I’ll go away tomorrow ... I’ll do more.,joy
1571,What am I?,anger
1572,An immoral woman!,anger
1573,A stone round your neck.,anger
1574,"I don’t want to make you wretched, I don’t want to!",anger
1575,I’ll set you free.,joy
1576,"You don’t love me; you love someone else!” Vronsky besought her to be calm, and declared that there was no trace of foundation for her jealousy; that he had never ceased, and never would cease, to love her; that he loved her more than ever.",love
1577,"“Anna, why distress yourself and me so?” he said to her, kissing her hands.",anger
1578,"There was tenderness now in his face, and she fancied she caught the sound of tears in his voice, and she felt them wet on her hand.",sadness
1579,And instantly Anna’s despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of tenderness.,anger
1580,"She put her arms round him, and covered with kisses his head, his neck, his hands.",anger
1581,"Feeling that the reconciliation was complete, Anna set eagerly to work in the morning preparing for their departure.",joy
1582,"Though it was not settled whether they should go on Monday or Tuesday, as they had each given way to the other, Anna packed busily, feeling absolutely indifferent whether they went a day earlier or later.",sadness
1583,"She was standing in her room over an open box, taking things out of it, when he came in to see her earlier than usual, dressed to go out.",anger
1584,“I’m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the money by Yegorov.,anger
1585,"And I shall be ready to go tomorrow,” he said.",joy
1586,"Though she was in such a good mood, the thought of his visit to his mother’s gave her a pang.",sadness
1587,"“No, I shan’t be ready by then myself,” she said; and at once reflected, “so then it was possible to arrange to do as I wished.” “No, do as you meant to do.",joy
1588,"Go into the dining-room, I’m coming directly.",joy
1589,"It’s only to turn out those things that aren’t wanted,” she said, putting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in Annushka’s arms.",anger
1590,Vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining-room.,joy
1591,"“You wouldn’t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me,” she said, sitting down beside him to her coffee.",anger
1592,“There’s nothing more awful than these _chambres garnies_.,sadness
1593,"There’s no individuality in them, no soul.",sadness
1594,"These clocks, and curtains, and, worst of all, the wallpapers—they’re a nightmare.",sadness
1595,I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as the promised land.,anger
1596,"You’re not sending the horses off yet?” “No, they will come after us.",anger
1597,Where are you going to?” “I wanted to go to Wilson’s to take some dresses to her.,anger
1598,So it’s really to be tomorrow?” she said in a cheerful voice; but suddenly her face changed.,joy
1599,Vronsky’s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram from Petersburg.,anger
1600,"There was nothing out of the way in Vronsky’s getting a telegram, but he said, as though anxious to conceal something from her, that the receipt was in his study, and he turned hurriedly to her.",anger
1601,"“By tomorrow, without fail, I will finish it all.” “From whom is the telegram?” she asked, not hearing him.",anger
1602,"“From Stiva,” he answered reluctantly.",anger
1603,“Why didn’t you show it to me?,anger
1604,"What secret can there be between Stiva and me?” Vronsky called the valet back, and told him to bring the telegram.",anger
1605,"“I didn’t want to show it to you, because Stiva has such a passion for telegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?” “About the divorce?” “Yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet.",joy
1606,He has promised a decisive answer in a day or two.,anger
1607,"But here it is; read it.” With trembling hands Anna took the telegram, and read what Vronsky had told her.",anger
1608,"At the end was added: “Little hope; but I will do everything possible and impossible.” “I said yesterday that it’s absolutely nothing to me when I get, or whether I never get, a divorce,” she said, flushing crimson.",joy
1609,"“There was not the slightest necessity to hide it from me.” “So he may hide and does hide his correspondence with women from me,” she thought.",anger
1610,"“Yashvin meant to come this morning with Voytov,” said Vronsky; “I believe he’s won from Pyevtsov all and more than he can pay, about sixty thousand.” “No,” she said, irritated by his so obviously showing by this change of subject that he was irritated, “why did you suppose that this news would affect me so, that you must even try to hide it?",anger
1611,"I said I don’t want to consider it, and I should have liked you to care as little about it as I do.” “I care about it because I like definiteness,” he said.",anger
1612,"“Definiteness is not in the form but the love,” she said, more and more irritated, not by his words, but by the tone of cool composure in which he spoke.",anger
1613,“What do you want it for?” “My God!,anger
1614,"love again,” he thought, frowning.",joy
1615,"“Oh, you know what for; for your sake and your children’s in the future.” “There won’t be children in the future.” “That’s a great pity,” he said.",joy
1616,"“You want it for the children’s sake, but you don’t think of me?” she said, quite forgetting or not having heard that he had said, “_For your sake_ and the children’s.” The question of the possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute and irritation to her.",anger
1617,His desire to have children she interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty.,joy
1618,"“Oh, I said: for your sake.",anger
1619,"Above all for your sake,” he repeated, frowning as though in pain, “because I am certain that the greater part of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position.” “Yes, now he has laid aside all pretense, and all his cold hatred for me is apparent,” she thought, not hearing his words, but watching with terror the cold, cruel judge who looked mocking her out of his eyes.",anger
1620,"“The cause is not that,” she said, “and, indeed, I don’t see how the cause of my irritability, as you call it, can be that I am completely in your power.",anger
1621,What indefiniteness is there in the position?,anger
1622,"on the contrary....” “I am very sorry that you don’t care to understand,” he interrupted, obstinately anxious to give utterance to his thought.",anger
1623,"“The indefiniteness consists in your imagining that I am free.” “On that score you can set your mind quite at rest,” she said, and turning away from him, she began drinking her coffee.",anger
1624,"She lifted her cup, with her little finger held apart, and put it to her lips.",anger
1625,"After drinking a few sips she glanced at him, and by his expression, she saw clearly that he was repelled by her hand, and her gesture, and the sound made by her lips.",joy
1626,"“I don’t care in the least what your mother thinks, and what match she wants to make for you,” she said, putting the cup down with a shaking hand.",sadness
1627,"“But we are not talking about that.” “Yes, that’s just what we are talking about.",joy
1628,"And let me tell you that a heartless woman, whether she’s old or not old, your mother or anyone else, is of no consequence to me, and I would not consent to know her.” “Anna, I beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother.” “A woman whose heart does not tell her where her son’s happiness and honor lie has no heart.” “I repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my mother, whom I respect,” he said, raising his voice and looking sternly at her.",anger
1629,She did not answer.,anger
1630,"Looking intently at him, at his face, his hands, she recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day, and his passionate caresses.",anger
1631,"“There, just such caresses he has lavished, and will lavish, and longs to lavish on other women!” she thought.",anger
1632,“You don’t love your mother.,anger
1633,"That’s all talk, and talk, and talk!” she said, looking at him with hatred in her eyes.",anger
1634,"“Even if so, you must....” “Must decide, and I have decided,” she said, and she would have gone away, but at that moment Yashvin walked into the room.",anger
1635,Anna greeted him and remained.,anger
1636,"Why, when there was a tempest in her soul, and she felt she was standing at a turning point in her life, which might have fearful consequences—why, at that minute, she had to keep up appearances before an outsider, who sooner or later must know it all—she did not know.",fear
1637,"But at once quelling the storm within her, she sat down and began talking to their guest.",anger
1638,"“Well, how are you getting on?",anger
1639,Has your debt been paid you?” she asked Yashvin.,anger
1640,"“Oh, pretty fair; I fancy I shan’t get it all, but I shall get a good half.",joy
1641,"And when are you off?” said Yashvin, looking at Vronsky, and unmistakably guessing at a quarrel.",anger
1642,"“The day after tomorrow, I think,” said Vronsky.",joy
1643,"“You’ve been meaning to go so long, though.” “But now it’s quite decided,” said Anna, looking Vronsky straight in the face with a look which told him not to dream of the possibility of reconciliation.",anger
1644,"“Don’t you feel sorry for that unlucky Pyevtsov?” she went on, talking to Yashvin.",sadness
1645,"“I’ve never asked myself the question, Anna Arkadyevna, whether I’m sorry for him or not.",anger
1646,"You see, all my fortune’s here”—he touched his breast pocket—“and just now I’m a wealthy man.",anger
1647,"But today I’m going to the club, and I may come out a beggar.",anger
1648,"You see, whoever sits down to play with me—he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back, and so do I him.",anger
1649,"And so we fight it out, and that’s the pleasure of it.” “Well, but suppose you were married,” said Anna, “how would it be for your wife?” Yashvin laughed.",anger
1650,"“That’s why I’m not married, and never mean to be.” “And Helsingfors?” said Vronsky, entering into the conversation and glancing at Anna’s smiling face.",joy
1651,"Meeting his eyes, Anna’s face instantly took a coldly severe expression as though she were saying to him: “It’s not forgotten.",sadness
1652,It’s all the same.” “Were you really in love?” she said to Yashvin.,anger
1653,“Oh heavens!,joy
1654,ever so many times!,anger
1655,"But you see, some men can play but only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a _rendezvous_ comes, while I can take up love, but only so as not to be late for my cards in the evening.",joy
1656,"That’s how I manage things.” “No, I didn’t mean that, but the real thing.” She would have said _Helsingfors_, but would not repeat the word used by Vronsky.",anger
1657,"Voytov, who was buying the horse, came in.",anger
1658,Anna got up and went out of the room.,anger
1659,"Before leaving the house, Vronsky went into her room.",anger
1660,"She would have pretended to be looking for something on the table, but ashamed of making a pretense, she looked straight in his face with cold eyes.",anger
1661,“What do you want?” she asked in French.,anger
1662,"“To get the guarantee for Gambetta, I’ve sold him,” he said, in a tone which said more clearly than words, “I’ve no time for discussing things, and it would lead to nothing.” “I’m not to blame in any way,” he thought.",sadness
1663,"“If she will punish herself, _tant pis pour elle._ But as he was going he fancied that she said something, and his heart suddenly ached with pity for her.",sadness
1664,"“Eh, Anna?” he queried.",anger
1665,"“I said nothing,” she answered just as coldly and calmly.",anger
1666,"“Oh, nothing, _tant pis_ then,” he thought, feeling cold again, and he turned and went out.",anger
1667,"As he was going out he caught a glimpse in the looking-glass of her face, white, with quivering lips.",fear
1668,"He even wanted to stop and to say some comforting word to her, but his legs carried him out of the room before he could think what to say.",anger
1669,"The whole of that day he spent away from home, and when he came in late in the evening the maid told him that Anna Arkadyevna had a headache and begged him not to go in to her.",anger
1670,Never before had a day been passed in quarrel.,anger
1671,Today was the first time.,anger
1672,And this was not a quarrel.,anger
1673,It was the open acknowledgment of complete coldness.,anger
1674,"Was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced when he came into the room for the guarantee?—to look at her, see her heart was breaking with despair, and go out without a word with that face of callous composure?",anger
1675,"He was not merely cold to her, he hated her because he loved another woman—that was clear.",anger
1676,"And remembering all the cruel words he had said, Anna supplied, too, the words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to her, and she grew more and more exasperated.",anger
1677,"“I won’t prevent you,” he might say.",anger
1678,“You can go where you like.,anger
1679,"You were unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no doubt so that you might go back to him.",anger
1680,Go back to him.,anger
1681,"If you want money, I’ll give it to you.",anger
1682,"How many roubles do you want?” All the most cruel words that a brutal man could say, he said to her in her imagination, and she could not forgive him for them, as though he had actually said them.",anger
1683,"“But didn’t he only yesterday swear he loved me, he, a truthful and sincere man?",joy
1684,Haven’t I despaired for nothing many times already?” she said to herself afterwards.,anger
1685,"All that day, except for the visit to Wilson’s, which occupied two hours, Anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether there were still hope of reconciliation, whether she should go away at once or see him once more.",joy
1686,"She was expecting him the whole day, and in the evening, as she went to her own room, leaving a message for him that her head ached, she said to herself, “If he comes in spite of what the maid says, it means that he loves me still.",anger
1687,"If not, it means that all is over, and then I will decide what I’m to do!...” In the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the entrance, his ring, his steps and his conversation with the servant; he believed what was told him, did not care to find out more, and went to his own room.",anger
1688,So then everything was over.,anger
1689,"And death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of bringing back love for her in his heart, of punishing him and of gaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her heart was waging with him.",anger
1690,"Now nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe, getting or not getting a divorce from her husband—all that did not matter.",anger
1691,The one thing that mattered was punishing him.,anger
1692,"When she poured herself out her usual dose of opium, and thought that she had only to drink off the whole bottle to die, it seemed to her so simple and easy, that she began musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer, and repent and love her memory when it would be too late.",sadness
1693,"She lay in bed with open eyes, by the light of a single burned-down candle, gazing at the carved cornice of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it, while she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would be no more, when she would be only a memory to him.",sadness
1694,“How could I say such cruel things to her?” he would say.,anger
1695,“How could I go out of the room without saying anything to her?,anger
1696,But now she is no more.,joy
1697,She has gone away from us forever.,anger
1698,"She is....” Suddenly the shadow of the screen wavered, pounced on the whole cornice, the whole ceiling; other shadows from the other side swooped to meet it, for an instant the shadows flitted back, but then with fresh swiftness they darted forward, wavered, commingled, and all was darkness.",joy
1699,“Death!” she thought.,anger
1700,"And such horror came upon her that for a long while she could not realize where she was, and for a long while her trembling hands could not find the matches and light another candle, instead of the one that had burned down and gone out.",anger
1701,"“No, anything—only to live!",joy
1702,"Why, I love him!",anger
1703,"Why, he loves me!",anger
1704,"This has been before and will pass,” she said, feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were trickling down her cheeks.",joy
1705,And to escape from her panic she went hurriedly to his room.,fear
1706,"He was asleep there, and sleeping soundly.",fear
1707,"She went up to him, and holding the light above his face, she gazed a long while at him.",anger
1708,"Now when he was asleep, she loved him so that at the sight of him she could not keep back tears of tenderness.",sadness
1709,"But she knew that if he waked up he would look at her with cold eyes, convinced that he was right, and that before telling him of her love, she would have to prove to him that he had been wrong in his treatment of her.",anger
1710,"Without waking him, she went back, and after a second dose of opium she fell towards morning into a heavy, incomplete sleep, during which she never quite lost consciousness.",sadness
1711,"In the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare, which had recurred several times in her dreams, even before her connection with Vronsky.",sadness
1712,"A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and she, as she always did in this nightmare (it was what made the horror of it), felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her, but was doing something horrible with the iron—over her.",sadness
1713,And she waked up in a cold sweat.,anger
1714,"When she got up, the previous day came back to her as though veiled in mist.",anger
1715,“There was a quarrel.,anger
1716,Just what has happened several times.,anger
1717,"I said I had a headache, and he did not come in to see me.",anger
1718,"Tomorrow we’re going away; I must see him and get ready for the journey,” she said to herself.",anger
1719,"And learning that he was in his study, she went down to him.",anger
1720,"As she passed through the drawing-room she heard a carriage stop at the entrance, and looking out of the window she saw the carriage, from which a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction to the footman ringing the bell.",joy
1721,"After a parley in the hall, someone came upstairs, and Vronsky’s steps could be heard passing the drawing-room.",anger
1722,He went rapidly downstairs.,anger
1723,Anna went again to the window.,anger
1724,She saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up to the carriage.,anger
1725,The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel.,anger
1726,"Vronsky, smiling, said something to her.",joy
1727,"The carriage drove away, he ran rapidly upstairs again.",anger
1728,The mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly.,anger
1729,The feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang.,sadness
1730,She could not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending a whole day with him in his house.,anger
1731,She went into his room to announce her determination.,anger
1732,“That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter.,anger
1733,They came and brought me the money and the deeds from maman.,anger
1734,I couldn’t get them yesterday.,anger
1735,"How is your head, better?” he said quietly, not wishing to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face.",sadness
1736,"She looked silently, intently at him, standing in the middle of the room.",anger
1737,"He glanced at her, frowned for a moment, and went on reading a letter.",anger
1738,"She turned, and went deliberately out of the room.",anger
1739,"He still might have turned her back, but she had reached the door, he was still silent, and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper as he turned it.",anger
1740,"“Oh, by the way,” he said at the very moment she was in the doorway, “we’re going tomorrow for certain, aren’t we?” “You, but not I,” she said, turning round to him.",anger
1741,"“Anna, we can’t go on like this....” “You, but not I,” she repeated.",anger
1742,"“This is getting unbearable!” “You ... you will be sorry for this,” she said, and went out.",anger
1743,"Frightened by the desperate expression with which these words were uttered, he jumped up and would have run after her, but on second thoughts he sat down and scowled, setting his teeth.",fear
1744,This vulgar—as he thought it—threat of something vague exasperated him.,anger
1745,"“I’ve tried everything,” he thought; “the only thing left is not to pay attention,” and he began to get ready to drive into town, and again to his mother’s to get her signature to the deeds.",anger
1746,She heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining-room.,joy
1747,At the drawing-room he stood still.,anger
1748,"But he did not turn in to see her, he merely gave an order that the horse should be given to Voytov if he came while he was away.",anger
1749,"Then she heard the carriage brought round, the door opened, and he came out again.",anger
1750,"But he went back into the porch again, and someone was running upstairs.",anger
1751,It was the valet running up for his gloves that had been forgotten.,sadness
1752,"She went to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking, and touching the coachman on the back he said something to him.",anger
1753,"Then without looking up at the window he settled himself in his usual attitude in the carriage, with his legs crossed, and drawing on his gloves he vanished round the corner.",anger
1754,“He has gone!,anger
1755,"It is over!” Anna said to herself, standing at the window; and in answer to this statement the impression of the darkness when the candle had flickered out, and of her fearful dream mingling into one, filled her heart with cold terror.",fear
1756,"“No, that cannot be!” she cried, and crossing the room she rang the bell.",anger
1757,"She was so afraid now of being alone, that without waiting for the servant to come in, she went out to meet him.",anger
1758,"“Inquire where the count has gone,” she said.",anger
1759,The servant answered that the count had gone to the stable.,anger
1760,"“His honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage would be back immediately.” “Very good.",joy
1761,Wait a minute.,joy
1762,I’ll write a note at once.,anger
1763,Send Mihail with the note to the stables.,anger
1764,Make haste.” She sat down and wrote: “I was wrong.,anger
1765,Come back home; I must explain.,anger
1766,For God’s sake come!,anger
1767,I’m afraid.” She sealed it up and gave it to the servant.,anger
1768,"She was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant out of the room, and went to the nursery.",fear
1769,"“Why, this isn’t it, this isn’t he!",anger
1770,"Where are his blue eyes, his sweet, shy smile?” was her first thought when she saw her chubby, rosy little girl with her black, curly hair instead of Seryozha, whom in the tangle of her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery.",joy
1771,"The little girl sitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it with a cork, and staring aimlessly at her mother with her pitch-black eyes.",fear
1772,"Answering the English nurse that she was quite well, and that she was going to the country tomorrow, Anna sat down by the little girl and began spinning the cork to show her.",anger
1773,"But the child’s loud, ringing laugh, and the motion of her eyebrows, recalled Vronsky so vividly that she got up hurriedly, restraining her sobs, and went away.",anger
1774,“Can it be all over?,anger
1775,"No, it cannot be!” she thought.",anger
1776,“He will come back.,anger
1777,"But how can he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to her?",sadness
1778,"But even if he doesn’t explain, I will believe.",anger
1779,"If I don’t believe, there’s only one thing left for me, and I can’t.” She looked at her watch.",anger
1780,Twenty minutes had passed.,anger
1781,“By now he has received the note and is coming back.,anger
1782,"Not long, ten minutes more....",joy
1783,But what if he doesn’t come?,anger
1784,"No, that cannot be.",joy
1785,He mustn’t see me with tear-stained eyes.,anger
1786,I’ll go and wash.,anger
1787,"Yes, yes; did I do my hair or not?” she asked herself.",anger
1788,And she could not remember.,anger
1789,She felt her head with her hand.,sadness
1790,"“Yes, my hair has been done, but when I did it I can’t in the least remember.” She could not believe the evidence of her hand, and went up to the pier-glass to see whether she really had done her hair.",anger
1791,"She certainly had, but she could not think when she had done it.",anger
1792,"“Who’s that?” she thought, looking in the looking-glass at the swollen face with strangely glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at her.",fear
1793,"“Why, it’s I!” she suddenly understood, and looking round, she seemed all at once to feel his kisses on her, and twitched her shoulders, shuddering.",love
1794,Then she lifted her hand to her lips and kissed it.,anger
1795,“What is it?,anger
1796,"Why, I’m going out of my mind!” and she went into her bedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room.",anger
1797,"“Annushka,” she said, coming to a standstill before her, and she stared at the maid, not knowing what to say to her.",anger
1798,"“You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,” said the girl, as though she understood.",anger
1799,“Darya Alexandrovna?,anger
1800,"Yes, I’ll go.” “Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back.",anger
1801,"He’s coming, he’ll be here soon.” She took out her watch and looked at it.",anger
1802,"“But how could he go away, leaving me in such a state?",anger
1803,"How can he live, without making it up with me?” She went to the window and began looking into the street.",anger
1804,"Judging by the time, he might be back now.",anger
1805,"But her calculations might be wrong, and she began once more to recall when he had started and to count the minutes.",anger
1806,"At the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it with her watch, someone drove up.",anger
1807,"Glancing out of the window, she saw his carriage.",anger
1808,"But no one came upstairs, and voices could be heard below.",anger
1809,It was the messenger who had come back in the carriage.,anger
1810,She went down to him.,anger
1811,“We didn’t catch the count.,anger
1812,The count had driven off on the lower city road.” “What do you say?,anger
1813,"What!...” she said to the rosy, good-humored Mihail, as he handed her back her note.",anger
1814,"“Why, then, he has never received it!” she thought.",anger
1815,"“Go with this note to Countess Vronskaya’s place, you know?",joy
1816,"and bring an answer back immediately,” she said to the messenger.",anger
1817,"“And I, what am I going to do?” she thought.",anger
1818,"“Yes, I’m going to Dolly’s, that’s true or else I shall go out of my mind.",joy
1819,"Yes, and I can telegraph, too.” And she wrote a telegram.",anger
1820,"“I absolutely must talk to you; come at once.” After sending off the telegram, she went to dress.",anger
1821,"When she was dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of the plump, comfortable-looking Annushka.",joy
1822,There was unmistakable sympathy in those good-natured little gray eyes.,joy
1823,"“Annushka, dear, what am I to do?” said Anna, sobbing and sinking helplessly into a chair.",fear
1824,"“Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna?",anger
1825,"Why, there’s nothing out of the way.",anger
1826,"You drive out a little, and it’ll cheer you up,” said the maid.",anger
1827,"“Yes, I’m going,” said Anna, rousing herself and getting up.",anger
1828,"“And if there’s a telegram while I’m away, send it on to Darya Alexandrovna’s ... but no, I shall be back myself.” “Yes, I mustn’t think, I must do something, drive somewhere, and most of all, get out of this house,” she said, feeling with terror the strange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she made haste to go out and get into the carriage.",fear
1829,“Where to?” asked Pyotr before getting onto the box.,anger
1830,"“To Znamenka, the Oblonskys’.” It was bright and sunny.",joy
1831,"A fine rain had been falling all the morning, and now it had not long cleared up.",joy
1832,"The iron roofs, the flags of the roads, the flints of the pavements, the wheels and leather, the brass and the tinplate of the carriages—all glistened brightly in the May sunshine.",anger
1833,"It was three o’clock, and the very liveliest time in the streets.",anger
1834,"As she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage, that hardly swayed on its supple springs, while the grays trotted swiftly, in the midst of the unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure air, Anna ran over the events of the last days, and she saw her position quite differently from how it had seemed at home.",joy
1835,"Now the thought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her, and death itself no longer seemed so inevitable.",joy
1836,Now she blamed herself for the humiliation to which she had lowered herself.,anger
1837,“I entreat him to forgive me.,anger
1838,I have given in to him.,anger
1839,I have owned myself in fault.,anger
1840,What for?,anger
1841,"Can’t I live without him?” And leaving unanswered the question how she was going to live without him, she fell to reading the signs on the shops.",anger
1842,“Office and warehouse.,anger
1843,Dental surgeon.,anger
1844,"Yes, I’ll tell Dolly all about it.",anger
1845,She doesn’t like Vronsky.,anger
1846,"I shall be sick and ashamed, but I’ll tell her.",sadness
1847,"She loves me, and I’ll follow her advice.",anger
1848,I won’t give in to him; I won’t let him train me as he pleases.,joy
1849,"Filippov, bun shop.",anger
1850,They say they send their dough to Petersburg.,anger
1851,The Moscow water is so good for it.,joy
1852,"Ah, the springs at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes!” And she remembered how, long, long ago, when she was a girl of seventeen, she had gone with her aunt to Troitsa.",anger
1853,"“Riding, too.",anger
1854,"Was that really me, with red hands?",anger
1855,"How much that seemed to me then splendid and out of reach has become worthless, while what I had then has gone out of my reach forever!",joy
1856,Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?,sadness
1857,How conceited and self-satisfied he will be when he gets my note!,joy
1858,But I will show him.... How horrid that paint smells!,sadness
1859,Why is it they’re always painting and building?,anger
1860,"_Modes et robes_, she read.",joy
1861,A man bowed to her.,anger
1862,It was Annushka’s husband.,anger
1863,“Our parasites”; she remembered how Vronsky had said that.,joy
1864,“Our?,anger
1865,Why our?,anger
1866,What’s so awful is that one can’t tear up the past by its roots.,sadness
1867,"One can’t tear it out, but one can hide one’s memory of it.",anger
1868,"And I’ll hide it.” And then she thought of her past with Alexey Alexandrovitch, of how she had blotted the memory of it out of her life.",anger
1869,"“Dolly will think I’m leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must be in the wrong.",anger
1870,As if I cared to be right!,anger
1871,"I can’t help it!” she said, and she wanted to cry.",anger
1872,But at once she fell to wondering what those two girls could be smiling about.,joy
1873,"“Love, most likely.",joy
1874,"They don’t know how dreary it is, how low....",sadness
1875,The boulevard and the children.,anger
1876,"Three boys running, playing at horses.",anger
1877,Seryozha!,anger
1878,And I’m losing everything and not getting him back.,anger
1879,"Yes, I’m losing everything, if he doesn’t return.",anger
1880,Perhaps he was late for the train and has come back by now.,anger
1881,Longing for humiliation again!” she said to herself.,sadness
1882,"“No, I’ll go to Dolly, and say straight out to her, I’m unhappy, I deserve this, I’m to blame, but still I’m unhappy, help me.",sadness
1883,"These horses, this carriage—how loathsome I am to myself in this carriage—all his; but I won’t see them again.” Thinking over the words in which she would tell Dolly, and mentally working her heart up to great bitterness, Anna went upstairs.",anger
1884,“Is there anyone with her?” she asked in the hall.,anger
1885,"“Katerina Alexandrovna Levin,” answered the footman.",anger
1886,“Kitty!,anger
1887,"Kitty, whom Vronsky was in love with!” thought Anna, “the girl he thinks of with love.",anger
1888,He’s sorry he didn’t marry her.,anger
1889,"But me he thinks of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me.” The sisters were having a consultation about nursing when Anna called.",anger
1890,Dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their conversation.,anger
1891,"“Well, so you’ve not gone away yet?",anger
1892,"I meant to have come to you,” she said; “I had a letter from Stiva today.” “We had a telegram too,” answered Anna, looking round for Kitty.",anger
1893,"“He writes that he can’t make out quite what Alexey Alexandrovitch wants, but he won’t go away without a decisive answer.” “I thought you had someone with you.",anger
1894,"Can I see the letter?” “Yes; Kitty,” said Dolly, embarrassed.",anger
1895,“She stayed in the nursery.,joy
1896,She has been very ill.” “So I heard.,anger
1897,May I see the letter?” “I’ll get it directly.,anger
1898,"But he doesn’t refuse; on the contrary, Stiva has hopes,” said Dolly, stopping in the doorway.",anger
1899,"“I haven’t, and indeed I don’t wish it,” said Anna.",anger
1900,“What’s this?,joy
1901,Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet me?” thought Anna when she was alone.,anger
1902,"“Perhaps she’s right, too.",anger
1903,"But it’s not for her, the girl who was in love with Vronsky, it’s not for her to show me that, even if it is true.",joy
1904,I know that in my position I can’t be received by any decent woman.,anger
1905,I knew that from the first moment I sacrificed everything to him.,anger
1906,And this is my reward!,joy
1907,"Oh, how I hate him!",anger
1908,And what did I come here for?,anger
1909,"I’m worse here, more miserable.” She heard from the next room the sisters’ voices in consultation.",anger
1910,“And what am I going to say to Dolly now?,anger
1911,"Amuse Kitty by the sight of my wretchedness, submit to her patronizing?",anger
1912,"No; and besides, Dolly wouldn’t understand.",anger
1913,And it would be no good my telling her.,joy
1914,"It would only be interesting to see Kitty, to show her how I despise everyone and everything, how nothing matters to me now.” Dolly came in with the letter.",anger
1915,Anna read it and handed it back in silence.,anger
1916,"“I knew all that,” she said, “and it doesn’t interest me in the least.” “Oh, why so?",anger
1917,"On the contrary, I have hopes,” said Dolly, looking inquisitively at Anna.",anger
1918,She had never seen her in such a strangely irritable condition.,anger
1919,“When are you going away?” she asked.,anger
1920,"Anna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not answer.",anger
1921,"“Why does Kitty shrink from me?” she said, looking at the door and flushing red.",anger
1922,"“Oh, what nonsense!",anger
1923,"She’s nursing, and things aren’t going right with her, and I’ve been advising her.... She’s delighted.",joy
1924,"She’ll be here in a minute,” said Dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying.",joy
1925,"“Yes, here she is.” Hearing that Anna had called, Kitty had wanted not to appear, but Dolly persuaded her.",anger
1926,"Rallying her forces, Kitty went in, walked up to her, blushing, and shook hands.",anger
1927,"“I am so glad to see you,” she said with a trembling voice.",joy
1928,Kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her.,joy
1929,"But as soon as she saw Anna’s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of antagonism disappeared.",sadness
1930,“I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me.,surprise
1931,I’m used to everything.,anger
1932,You have been ill?,anger
1933,"Yes, you are changed,” said Anna.",anger
1934,Kitty felt that Anna was looking at her with hostile eyes.,anger
1935,"She ascribed this hostility to the awkward position in which Anna, who had once patronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.",sadness
1936,"They talked of Kitty’s illness, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was obvious that nothing interested Anna.",anger
1937,"“I came to say good-bye to you,” she said, getting up.",anger
1938,"“Oh, when are you going?”  But again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty.",anger
1939,"“Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,” she said with a smile.",joy
1940,"“I have heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband.",anger
1941,"He came to see me, and I liked him exceedingly,” she said, unmistakably with malicious intent.",anger
1942,"“Where is he?”  “He has gone back to the country,” said Kitty, blushing.",anger
1943,"“Remember me to him, be sure you do.”  “I’ll be sure to!” Kitty said naïvely, looking compassionately into her eyes.",joy
1944,"“So good-bye, Dolly.” And kissing Dolly and shaking hands with Kitty, Anna went out hurriedly.",anger
1945,“She’s just the same and just as charming!,joy
1946,"She’s very lovely!” said Kitty, when she was alone with her sister.",joy
1947,“But there’s something piteous about her.,anger
1948,"Awfully piteous!”  “Yes, there’s something unusual about her today,” said Dolly.",fear
1949,"“When I went with her into the hall, I fancied she was almost crying.”    Anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than when she set out from home.",sadness
1950,To her previous tortures was added now that sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so distinctly on meeting Kitty.,sadness
1951,“Where to?,anger
1952,Home?” asked Pyotr.,anger
1953,"“Yes, home,” she said, not even thinking now where she was going.",anger
1954,"“How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and curious!",surprise
1955,"What can he be telling the other with such warmth?” she thought, staring at two men who walked by.",anger
1956,“Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?,fear
1957,"I meant to tell Dolly, and it’s a good thing I didn’t tell her.",anger
1958,How pleased she would have been at my misery!,joy
1959,"She would have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have been delight at my being punished for the happiness she envied me for.",sadness
1960,"Kitty, she would have been even more pleased.",joy
1961,How I can see through her!,anger
1962,She knows I was more than usually sweet to her husband.,joy
1963,And she’s jealous and hates me.,anger
1964,And she despises me.,anger
1965,In her eyes I’m an immoral woman.,anger
1966,If I were an immoral woman I could have made her husband fall in love with me ... if I’d cared to.,anger
1967,"And, indeed, I did care to.",anger
1968,"There’s someone who’s pleased with himself,” she thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund gentleman coming towards her.",joy
1969,"He took her for an acquaintance, and lifted his glossy hat above his bald, glossy head, and then perceived his mistake.",joy
1970,“He thought he knew me.,anger
1971,"Well, he knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me.",joy
1972,I don’t know myself.,anger
1973,"I know my appetites, as the French say.",anger
1974,"They want that dirty ice cream, that they do know for certain,” she thought, looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller, who took a barrel off his head and began wiping his perspiring face with a towel.",anger
1975,“We all want what is sweet and nice.,joy
1976,"If not sweetmeats, then a dirty ice.",anger
1977,"And Kitty’s the same—if not Vronsky, then Levin.",anger
1978,"And she envies me, and hates me.",anger
1979,And we all hate each other.,anger
1980,"I Kitty, Kitty me.",anger
1981,"Yes, that’s the truth.",anger
1982,"‘_Tiutkin, coiffeur._’ _Je me fais coiffer par Tiutkin...._ I’ll tell him that when he comes,” she thought and smiled.",joy
1983,But the same instant she remembered that she had no one now to tell anything amusing to.,anger
1984,"“And there’s nothing amusing, nothing mirthful, really.",surprise
1985,It’s all hateful.,anger
1986,"They’re singing for vespers, and how carefully that merchant crosses himself!",joy
1987,as if he were afraid of missing something.,fear
1988,Why these churches and this singing and this humbug?,anger
1989,Simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily.,anger
1990,"Yashvin says, ‘He wants to strip me of my shirt, and I him of his.’ Yes, that’s the truth!”  She was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her that she left off thinking of her own position, when the carriage drew up at the steps of her house.",sadness
1991,It was only when she saw the porter running out to meet her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram.,anger
1992,“Is there an answer?” she inquired.,anger
1993,"“I’ll see this minute,” answered the porter, and glancing into his room, he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram.",anger
1994,"“I can’t come before ten o’clock.—Vronsky,” she read.",anger
1995,"“And hasn’t the messenger come back?”  “No,” answered the porter.",anger
1996,"“Then, since it’s so, I know what I must do,” she said, and feeling a vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her, she ran upstairs.",sadness
1997,“I’ll go to him myself.,anger
1998,"Before going away forever, I’ll tell him all.",anger
1999,Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!” she thought.,anger
2000,"Seeing his hat on the rack, she shuddered with aversion.",fear
2001,She did not consider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he had not yet received her note.,anger
2002,She pictured him to herself as talking calmly to his mother and Princess Sorokina and rejoicing at her sufferings.,anger
2003,"“Yes, I must go quickly,” she said, not knowing yet where she was going.",anger
2004,She longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she had gone through in that awful house.,sadness
2005,"The servants, the walls, the things in that house—all aroused repulsion and hatred in her and lay like a weight upon her.",sadness
2006,"“Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he’s not there, then go there and catch him.” Anna looked at the railway timetable in the newspapers.",anger
2007,An evening train went at two minutes past eight.,anger
2008,"“Yes, I shall be in time.” She gave orders for the other horses to be put in the carriage, and packed in a traveling-bag the things needed for a few days.",anger
2009,She knew she would never come back here again.,anger
2010,"Among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that after what would happen at the station or at the countess’s house, she would go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.",anger
2011,"Dinner was on the table; she went up, but the smell of the bread and cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting.",sadness
2012,She ordered the carriage and went out.,anger
2013,"The house threw a shadow now right across the street, but it was a bright evening and still warm in the sunshine.",joy
2014,"Annushka, who came down with her things, and Pyotr, who put the things in the carriage, and the coachman, evidently out of humor, were all hateful to her, and irritated her by their words and actions.",anger
2015,"“I don’t want you, Pyotr.”  “But how about the ticket?”  “Well, as you like, it doesn’t matter,” she said crossly.",anger
2016,"Pyotr jumped on the box, and putting his arms akimbo, told the coachman to drive to the booking-office.",anger
2017,“Here it is again!,anger
2018,"Again I understand it all!” Anna said to herself, as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly, rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one impression followed rapidly upon another.",joy
2019,“Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?” she tried to recall it.,anger
2020,"“‘_Tiutkin, coiffeur?_’—no, not that.",joy
2021,"Yes, of what Yashvin says, the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds men together.",anger
2022,"No, it’s a useless journey you’re making,” she said, mentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an excursion into the country.",sadness
2023,“And the dog you’re taking with you will be no help to you.,anger
2024,"You can’t get away from yourselves.” Turning her eyes in the direction Pyotr had turned to look, she saw a factory-hand almost dead-drunk, with hanging head, being led away by a policeman.",anger
2025,"“Come, he’s found a quicker way,” she thought.",anger
2026,"“Count Vronsky and I did not find that happiness either, though we expected so much from it.” And now for the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she was seeing everything on to her relations with him, which she had hitherto avoided thinking about.",sadness
2027,“What was it he sought in me?,anger
2028,"Not love so much as the satisfaction of vanity.” She remembered his words, the expression of his face, that recalled an abject setter-dog, in the early days of their connection.",sadness
2029,And everything now confirmed this.,joy
2030,"“Yes, there was the triumph of success in him.",joy
2031,"Of course there was love too, but the chief element was the pride of success.",joy
2032,He boasted of me.,anger
2033,Now that’s over.,anger
2034,There’s nothing to be proud of.,joy
2035,"Not to be proud of, but to be ashamed of.",sadness
2036,"He has taken from me all he could, and now I am no use to him.",anger
2037,He is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable in his behavior to me.,anger
2038,He let that out yesterday—he wants divorce and marriage so as to burn his ships.,anger
2039,"He loves me, but how?",anger
2040,"The zest is gone, as the English say.",joy
2041,"That fellow wants everyone to admire him and is very much pleased with himself,” she thought, looking at a red-faced clerk, riding on a riding-school horse.",joy
2042,"“Yes, there’s not the same flavor about me for him now.",joy
2043,"If I go away from him, at the bottom of his heart he will be glad.”  This was not mere supposition, she saw it distinctly in the piercing light, which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human relations.",joy
2044,"“My love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic, while his is waning and waning, and that’s why we’re drifting apart.” She went on musing.",love
2045,“And there’s no help for it.,anger
2046,"He is everything for me, and I want him more and more to give himself up to me entirely.",joy
2047,And he wants more and more to get away from me.,anger
2048,"We walked to meet each other up to the time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions.",anger
2049,And there’s no altering that.,joy
2050,"He tells me I’m insanely jealous, and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous; but it’s not true.",anger
2051,"I’m not jealous, but I’m unsatisfied.",anger
2052,"But....” she opened her lips, and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement, aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her.",anger
2053,"“If I could be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but his caresses; but I can’t and I don’t care to be anything else.",love
2054,"And by that desire I rouse aversion in him, and he rouses fury in me, and it cannot be different.",joy
2055,"Don’t I know that he wouldn’t deceive me, that he has no schemes about Princess Sorokina, that he’s not in love with Kitty, that he won’t desert me!",sadness
2056,"I know all that, but it makes it no better for me.",joy
2057,"If without loving me, from _duty_ he’ll be good and kind to me, without what I want, that’s a thousand times worse than unkindness!",anger
2058,That’s—hell!,anger
2059,And that’s just how it is.,anger
2060,For a long while now he hasn’t loved me.,love
2061,"And where love ends, hate begins.",anger
2062,I don’t know these streets at all.,anger
2063,"Hills it seems, and still houses, and houses.... And in the houses always people and people.... How many of them, no end, and all hating each other!",anger
2064,"Come, let me try and think what I want, to make me happy.",joy
2065,Well?,joy
2066,"Suppose I am divorced, and Alexey Alexandrovitch lets me have Seryozha, and I marry Vronsky.” Thinking of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she at once pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before her, with his mild, lifeless, dull eyes, the blue veins in his white hands, his intonations and the cracking of his fingers, and remembering the feeling which had existed between them, and which was also called love, she shuddered with loathing.",love
2067,"“Well, I’m divorced, and become Vronsky’s wife.",anger
2068,"Well, will Kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today?",anger
2069,No.,joy
2070,And will Seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands?,anger
2071,And is there any new feeling I can awaken between Vronsky and me?,joy
2072,"Is there possible, if not happiness, some sort of ease from misery?",sadness
2073,"No, no!” she answered now without the slightest hesitation.",fear
2074,“Impossible!,anger
2075,"We are drawn apart by life, and I make his unhappiness, and he mine, and there’s no altering him or me.",anger
2076,"Every attempt has been made, the screw has come unscrewed.",anger
2077,"Oh, a beggar woman with a baby.",joy
2078,She thinks I’m sorry for her.,anger
2079,"Aren’t we all flung into the world only to hate each other, and so to torture ourselves and each other?",anger
2080,Schoolboys coming—laughing Seryozha?” she thought.,anger
2081,"“I thought, too, that I loved him, and used to be touched by my own tenderness.",love
2082,"But I have lived without him, I gave him up for another love, and did not regret the exchange till that love was satisfied.” And with loathing she thought of what she meant by that love.",joy
2083,"And the clearness with which she saw life now, her own and all men’s, was a pleasure to her.",joy
2084,"“It’s so with me and Pyotr, and the coachman, Fyodor, and that merchant, and all the people living along the Volga, where those placards invite one to go, and everywhere and always,” she thought when she had driven under the low-pitched roof of the Nizhigorod station, and the porters ran to meet her.",anger
2085,“A ticket to Obiralovka?” said Pyotr.,anger
2086,"She had utterly forgotten where and why she was going, and only by a great effort she understood the question.",anger
2087,"“Yes,” she said, handing him her purse, and taking a little red bag in her hand, she got out of the carriage.",anger
2088,"Making her way through the crowd to the first-class waiting-room, she gradually recollected all the details of her position, and the plans between which she was hesitating.",anger
2089,"And again at the old sore places, hope and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured, fearfully throbbing heart.",anger
2090,"As she sat on the star-shaped sofa waiting for the train, she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going (they were all hateful to her), and thought how she would arrive at the station, would write him a note, and what she would write to him, and how he was at this moment complaining to his mother of his position, not understanding her sufferings, and how she would go into the room, and what she would say to him.",anger
2091,"Then she thought that life might still be happy, and how miserably she loved and hated him, and how fearfully her heart was beating.",anger
2092,"A bell rang, some young men, ugly and impudent, and at the same time careful of the impression they were making, hurried by.",anger
2093,"Pyotr, too, crossed the room in his livery and top-boots, with his dull, animal face, and came up to her to take her to the train.",anger
2094,"Some noisy men were quiet as she passed them on the platform, and one whispered something about her to another—something vile, no doubt.",anger
2095,"She stepped up on the high step, and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that had been white.",anger
2096,"Her bag lay beside her, shaken up and down by the springiness of the seat.",fear
2097,"With a foolish smile Pyotr raised his hat, with its colored band, at the window, in token of farewell; an impudent conductor slammed the door and the latch.",anger
2098,"A grotesque-looking lady wearing a bustle (Anna mentally undressed the woman, and was appalled at her hideousness), and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the platform.",anger
2099,"“Katerina Andreevna, she’s got them all, _ma tante!_” cried the girl.",anger
2100,"“Even the child’s hideous and affected,” thought Anna.",anger
2101,"To avoid seeing anyone, she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage.",anger
2102,"A misshapen-looking peasant covered with dirt, in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round, passed by that window, stooping down to the carriage wheels.",anger
2103,"“There’s something familiar about that hideous peasant,” thought Anna.",joy
2104,"And remembering her dream, she moved away to the opposite door, shaking with terror.",fear
2105,The conductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife.,anger
2106,“Do you wish to get out?”  Anna made no answer.,anger
2107,The conductor and her two fellow-passengers did not notice under her veil her panic-stricken face.,fear
2108,She went back to her corner and sat down.,anger
2109,"The couple seated themselves on the opposite side, and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes.",anger
2110,Both husband and wife seemed repulsive to Anna.,anger
2111,"The husband asked, would she allow him to smoke, obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into conversation with her.",anger
2112,"Receiving her assent, he said to his wife in French something about caring less to smoke than to talk.",anger
2113,"They made inane and affected remarks to one another, entirely for her benefit.",joy
2114,"Anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other, and hated each other.",anger
2115,And no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities.,sadness
2116,"A second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, noise, shouting and laughter.",anger
2117,"It was so clear to Anna that there was nothing for anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated her agonizingly, and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it.",anger
2118,"At last the third bell rang, there was a whistle and a hiss of steam, and a clank of chains, and the man in her carriage crossed himself.",anger
2119,"“It would be interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that,” thought Anna, looking angrily at him.",anger
2120,She looked past the lady out of the window at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood on the platform.,anger
2121,"The train, jerking at regular intervals at the junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone wall, a signal-box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly and evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails.",joy
2122,"The window was lighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze fluttered the curtain.",joy
2123,"Anna forgot her fellow passengers, and to the light swaying of the train she fell to thinking again, as she breathed the fresh air.",joy
2124,"“Yes, what did I stop at?",anger
2125,"That I couldn’t conceive a position in which life would not be a misery, that we are all created to be miserable, and that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving each other.",sadness
2126,"And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?”  “That’s what reason is given man for, to escape from what worries him,” said the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and obviously pleased with her phrase.",joy
2127,The words seemed an answer to Anna’s thoughts.,sadness
2128,"“To escape from what worries him,” repeated Anna.",sadness
2129,"And glancing at the red-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived her and encouraged her in that idea of herself.",anger
2130,"Anna seemed to see all their history and all the crannies of their souls, as it were turning a light upon them.",anger
2131,"But there was nothing interesting in them, and she pursued her thought.",anger
2132,"“Yes, I’m very much worried, and that’s what reason was given me for, to escape; so then one must escape: why not put out the light when there’s nothing more to look at, when it’s sickening to look at it all?",anger
2133,But how?,anger
2134,"Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they shrieking, those young men in that train?",joy
2135,"why are they talking, why are they laughing?",anger
2136,"It’s all falsehood, all lying, all humbug, all cruelty!...”  When the train came into the station, Anna got out into the crowd of passengers, and moving apart from them as if they were lepers, she stood on the platform, trying to think what she had come here for, and what she meant to do.",anger
2137,"Everything that had seemed to her possible before was now so difficult to consider, especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave her alone.",anger
2138,"One moment porters ran up to her proffering their services, then young men, clacking their heels on the planks of the platform and talking loudly, stared at her; people meeting her dodged past on the wrong side.",anger
2139,"Remembering that she had meant to go on further if there were no answer, she stopped a porter and asked if her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.",anger
2140,“Count Vronsky?,anger
2141,"They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute, to meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter.",anger
2142,"And what is the coachman like?”  Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so successfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a letter.",joy
2143,"She broke it open, and her heart ached before she had read it.",anger
2144,“I am very sorry your note did not reach me.,anger
2145,"I will be home at ten,” Vronsky had written carelessly....  “Yes, that’s what I expected!” she said to herself with an evil smile.",joy
2146,"“Very good, you can go home then,” she said softly, addressing Mihail.",joy
2147,She spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart’s beating hindered her breathing.,anger
2148,"“No, I won’t let you make me miserable,” she thought menacingly, addressing not him, not herself, but the power that made her suffer, and she walked along the platform.",anger
2149,"Two maid-servants walking along the platform turned their heads, staring at her and making some remarks about her dress.",anger
2150,"“Real,” they said of the lace she was wearing.",anger
2151,The young men would not leave her in peace.,anger
2152,"Again they passed by, peering into her face, and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice.",anger
2153,The station-master coming up asked her whether she was going by train.,anger
2154,A boy selling kvas never took his eyes off her.,anger
2155,“My God!,anger
2156,"where am I to go?” she thought, going farther and farther along the platform.",joy
2157,At the end she stopped.,anger
2158,"Some ladies and children, who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles, paused in their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her as she reached them.",anger
2159,She quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of the platform.,joy
2160,A luggage train was coming in.,anger
2161,"The platform began to sway, and she fancied she was in the train again.",anger
2162,"And all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she had first met Vronsky, and she knew what she had to do.",anger
2163,"With a rapid, light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train.",anger
2164,"She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up, and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.",anger
2165,"“There,” she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the carriage, at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers—“there, in the very middle, and I will punish him and escape from everyone and from myself.”  She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment.",sadness
2166,She had to wait for the next carriage.,anger
2167,"A feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed herself.",joy
2168,"That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys.",joy
2169,But she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage.,anger
2170,"And exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once, dropped on to her knees.",sadness
2171,And at the same instant she was terror-stricken at what she was doing.,anger
2172,“Where am I?,anger
2173,What am I doing?,anger
2174,"What for?” She tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back.",anger
2175,"“Lord, forgive me all!” she said, feeling it impossible to struggle.",sadness
2176,A peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her.,anger
2177,"And the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her all that had been in darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was quenched forever.",anger
