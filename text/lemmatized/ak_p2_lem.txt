advice when spring come be to go abroad a celebrated physician be call in the celebrated physician a very handsome man still youngish ask to examine the patient he maintain with peculiar satisfaction it seem that maiden modesty be a mere relic of barbarism and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still youngish to handle a young girl naked he think it natural because he do it every day and feel and think as it seem to he no harm as he do it and consequently he consider modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of barbarism but also as an insult to himself there be nothing for it but to submit since although all the doctor have study in the same school have read the same book and learn the same science and though some people say this celebrated doctor be a bad doctor in the princess ’s household and circle it be for some reason accept that this celebrate doctor alone have some special knowledge and that he alone could save kitty after a careful examination and sounding of the bewildered patient daze with shame the celebrated doctor have scrupulously wash his hand be stand in the drawingroom talk to the prince the prince frown and cough listen to the doctor as a man who have see something of life and neither a fool nor an invalid he have no faith in medicine and in his heart be furious at the whole farce specially as he be perhaps the only one who fully comprehend the cause of kitty ’s illness " conceite blockhead " he think as he listen to the celebrated doctor ’s chatter about his daughter ’s symptom the doctor be meantime with difficulty restrain the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman and with difficulty condescend to the level of his intelligence he perceive that it be no good talk to the old man and that the principal person in the house be the mother before she he decide to scatter his pearl at that instant the princess come into the drawingroom with the family doctor the prince withdraw try not to show how ridiculous he think the whole performance the princess be distract and do not know what to do she feel she have sin against kitty " well doctor decide our fate " say the princess " tell I everything " " be there hope " she mean to say but her lip quiver and she could not utter the question " well doctor " " immediately princess I will talk it over with my colleague and then I will have the honor of lay my opinion before you " " so we have well leave you " " as you please " the princess go out with a sigh when the doctor be leave alone the family doctor begin timidly explain his opinion that there be a commencement of tuberculous trouble but   and so on the celebrated doctor listen to he and in the middle of his sentence look at his big gold watch " yes " say he " but " the family doctor respectfully cease in the middle of his observation " the commencement of the tuberculous process we be not as you be aware able to define till there be cavity there be nothing definite but we may suspect it and there be indication malnutrition nervous excitability and so on the question stand thus in presence of indication of tuberculous process what be to be do to maintain nutrition " " but you know there be always moral spiritual cause at the back in these case " the family doctor permit himself to interpolate with a subtle smile " yes that ’ an understood thing " respond the celebrated physician again glance at his watch " beg pardon be the yausky bridge do yet or shall I have to drive around " he ask " ah it be oh well then I can do it in twenty minute so we be say the problem may be put thus to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerve the one be in close connection with the other one must attack both side at once " " and how about a tour abroad " ask the family doctor " I ’ve no liking for foreign tour and take note if there be an early stage of tuberculous process of which we can not be certain a foreign tour will be of no use what be want be mean of improve nutrition and not for lower it " and the celebrated doctor expound his plan of treatment with soden waters a remedy obviously prescribe primarily on the ground that they could do no harm the family doctor listen attentively and respectfully " but in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habit the removal from condition call up reminiscence and then the mother wish it " he add " ah well in that case to be sure let they go only those german quack be mischievous they ought to be persuade well let they go then " he glance once more at his watch " oh time ’ up already " and he go to the door the celebrated doctor announce to the princess a feeling of what be due from he dictate his do so that he ought to see the patient once more " what another examination " cry the mother with horror " oh no only a few detail princess " " come this way " and the mother accompany by the doctor go into the drawingroom to kitty wasted and flush with a peculiar glitter in her eye leave there by the agony of shame she have be put through kitty stand in the middle of the room when the doctor come in she flush crimson and her eye fill with tear all her illness and treatment strike she as a thing so stupid ludicrous even doctor she seem to she as absurd as put together the piece of a broken vase her heart be break why would they try to cure she with pill and powder but she could not grieve her mother especially as her mother consider herself to blame " may I trouble you to sit down princess " the celebrated doctor say to she he sit down with a smile face she feel her pulse and

celebrated doctor do not take offense " nervous irritability " he say to the princess when kitty have leave the room " however I have finish " and the doctor begin scientifically explain to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and conclude by insist on the drinking of the water which be certainly harmless at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunge into deep meditation as though resolve a weighty problem finally his decision be pronounce they be to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quack and to apply to he in any need it seem as though some piece of good fortune have come to pass after the doctor have go the mother be much more cheerful when she go back to her daughter and kitty pretend to be more cheerful she have

decorate the room the year before together with what love and gaiety her heart turn cold when she see kitty sit on a low chair near the door her eye fix immovably on a corner of the rug kitty glance at her sister and the cold rather illtempered expression of her face do not change " I ’m just go now and I shall have to keep in and you will not be able to come to see I " say dolly sit down beside she " I want to talk to you " " what about " kitty ask swiftly lift her head in dismay " what should it be but your trouble " " I have no trouble " " nonsense kitty do you suppose I could help know I know all about it and believe I it ’ of so little consequence we ’ve all be through it " kitty do not speak and her face have a stern expression " he ’ not worth your grieve over he " pursue darya

have say that I ’m certain he be in love with you and would still be in love with you if it have not " " oh the most awful thing of all for I be this sympathizing " shriek kitty suddenly fly into a passion she turn round on her chair flush crimson and rapidly move her finger pinch the clasp of her belt first with one hand and then with the other dolly know this trick her sister have of clench her hand when she be much excited she know too that in moment of excitement kitty be capable of forget herself and say a great deal too much and dolly would have soothe she but it be too late " what what be it you want to make I feel eh " say kitty quickly " that I ’ve be in love with a man who do not care a straw for I and that I ’m die of love for he and this be say to I by my own sister who imagine that   that   that she ’ sympathize with I I do not want these condolence and humbug " " kitty you ’re unjust " " why be you torment I " " but I   quite the contrary   I see you ’re unhappy " but kitty in her fury do not hear she " I ’ve nothing to grieve over and be comfort about I be too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who do not love I " " yes I do not say so either only one thing tell I the truth " say darya alexandrovna take she by the hand " tell I do levin speak to you " the mention of levin ’s name seem to deprive kitty of the last vestige of selfcontrol she leap up from her chair and fling her clasp on the ground she gesticulate rapidly with her hand and say " why bring levin in too I can not understand what you want to torment I for I ’ve tell you and I say it again that I have some pride and never never would I do as you ’re do — go back to a man who ’ deceive you who have care for another woman I can not understand it you may but I can n’t " and say these word she glance at her sister and see that dolly sit silent her head mournfully bow kitty instead of run out of the room as she have mean to do sit down near the door and hide her face in her handkerchief the silence last for two minute dolly be think of herself that humiliation of which she be always conscious come back to she with a peculiar bitterness when her sister remind she of it she have not look for such cruelty in her sister and she be angry with she but suddenly she hear the rustle of a skirt and with it the sound of heartrending smother sobbing and feel arm about her neck kitty be on her knee before her " dolinka I be so so wretched " she whisper penitently and the sweet face cover with tear hide itself in darya alexandrovna ’s skirt as though tear be the indispensable oil without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sister the sister after their tear talk not of what be uppermost in their mind but though they talk of outside matter they understand each other kitty know that the word she have utter in anger about her husband ’s infidelity and her humiliating position have cut her poor sister to the heart but that she have forgive her dolly for her part know all she have want to find out she feel certain that her surmise be correct that kitty ’s misery her inconsolable misery be due precisely to the fact that levin have make she an offer and she have refuse he and vronsky have deceive she and that she be fully prepared to love levin and to detest vronsky kitty say not a word of that she talk of nothing but her spiritual condition " I have nothing to make I miserable " she say get calm " but can you understand that everything have become hateful loathsome coarse to I and I myself most of all you can not imagine what loathsome thought I have about everything " " why whatever loathsome thought can you have " ask dolly smile " the most utterly loathsome and coarse I can not tell you it ’ not unhappiness or low spirit but much bad as though everything that be good in I be all hide away and nothing be leave but the most loathsome come how be I to tell you " she go on see the puzzled look in her sister ’s eye " father begin say something to I just now it seem to I he think all I want be to be married mother take I to a ball it seem to I she only take I to get I marry off as soon as may be and be rid of I I know it ’ not the truth but I can not drive away such thought eligible suitor as they call they — I can not bear to see they it seem to I they ’re take stock of I and sum I up in old day to go anywhere in a ball dress be a simple joy to I I admire myself now I feel ashamed and awkward and then the doctor then " kitty hesitate she want to say far that ever since this change have take place in she stepan arkadyevitch have become insufferably repulsive to she and that she could not see he without the gross and most hideous conception rise before her imagination " oh well everything present itself to I in the coarse most loathsome light " she go on " that ’ my illness perhaps it will pass off " " but you must not think about it " " I can not help it I ’m never happy except with the child at your house " " what a pity you can not be with I " " oh yes I ’m come I ’ve have scarlatina and I ’ll persuade mamma to let I " kitty insist on have her way and go to stay at her sister ’s and nurse the child all through the scarlatina for scarlatina it turn out to be the two sister bring all the six child successfully through it but kitty be no well in health and in lent the shtcherbatskys go abroad the high petersburg society be essentially one in it everyone know everyone else everyone even visit everyone else but this great set have its subdivision anna arkadyevna karenina have friend and close tie in three different circle of this high society one circle be her husband ’s government official set consist of his colleague and subordinate bring together in the most various and capricious manner and belong to different social stratum anna find it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awestricken reverence which she have at first entertain for these person now she know all of they as people know one another in a country town she know their habit and weakness and where the shoe pinch each one of they she know their relation with one another and with the head authority know who be for whom and how each one maintain his position and where they agree and disagree but the circle of political masculine interest have never interest she in spite of countess lidia ivanovna ’s influence and she avoid it another little set with which anna be in close relation be the one by mean of which alexey alexandrovitch have make his career the center of this circle be the countess lidia ivanovna it be a set make up of elderly ugly benevolent and godly woman and clever learned and ambitious man one of the clever people belong to the set have call it " the conscience of petersburg society " alexey alexandrovitch have the high esteem for this circle and anna with her special gift for get on with everyone have in the early day of her life in petersburg make friend in this circle also now since her return from moscow she have come to feel this set insufferable it seem to she that both she and all of they be insincere and she feel so bored and ill at ease in that world that she go to see the countess lidia ivanovna as little as possible the third circle with which anna have tie be preeminently the fashionable world — the world of ball of dinner of sumptuous dress the world that hang on to the court with one hand so as to avoid sink to the level of the demimonde for the demimonde the member of that fashionable world believe that they despise though their taste be not merely similar but in fact identical her connection with this circle be keep up through princess betsy tverskaya her cousin ’s wife who have an income of a hundred and twenty thousand rouble and who have take a great fancy to anna ever since she first come out show she much attention and draw she into her set make fun of countess lidia ivanovna ’s coterie " when I ’m old and ugly I ’ll be the same " betsy use to say " but for a pretty young woman like you it ’ early day for that house of charity " anna have at first avoid as far as she could princess tverskaya ’s world because it necessitate an expenditure beyond her mean and besides in her heart she prefer the first circle but since her visit to moscow she have do quite the contrary she avoid her seriousminded friend and go out into the fashionable world there she meet vronsky and experience an agitate joy at those meeting she meet vronsky specially often at betsy ’s for betsy be a vronsky by birth and his cousin vronsky be everywhere where he have any chance of meet anna and speak to she when he could of his love she give he no encouragement but every time she meet he there surge up in her heart that same feeling of quicken life that have come upon she that day in the railway carriage when she see he for the first time she be conscious herself that her delight sparkle in her eye and curve her lip into a smile and she could not quench the expression of this delight at first anna sincerely believe that she be displeased with he for dare to pursue she soon after her return from moscow on arrive at a soirée where she have expect to meet he and not find he there she realize distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she have be deceive herself and that this pursuit be not merely not distasteful to she but that it make the whole interest of her life the celebrated singer be singe for the second time and all the fashionable world be in the theater vronsky see his cousin from his stall in the front row do not wait till the entr’acte but go to her box " why do not you come to dinner " she say to he " I marvel at the second sight of lover " she add with a smile so that no one but he could hear " she be not there but come after the opera " vronsky look inquiringly at she she nod he thank she by a smile and sit down beside she " but how I remember your jeer " continue princess betsy who take a peculiar pleasure in follow up this passion to a successful issue " what ’ become of all that you ’re catch my dear boy " " that ’ my one desire to be catch " answer vronsky with his serene goodhumored smile " if I complain of anything it ’ only that I ’m not catch enough to tell the truth I begin to lose hope " " why whatever hope can you have " say betsy offend on behalf of her friend " entendons nous " but in her eye there be gleam of light that betray that she understand perfectly and precisely as he do what hope he might have " none whatever " say vronsky laugh and show his even row of tooth " excuse I " he add take an operaglass out of her hand and proceed to scrutinize over her bare shoulder the row of box face they " I ’m afraid I ’m become ridiculous " he be very well aware that he run no risk of be ridiculous in the eye of betsy or any other fashionable people he be very well aware that in their eye the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl or of any woman free to marry might be ridiculous but the position of a man pursue a married woman and regardless of everything stake his life on draw she into adultery have something fine and grand about it and can never be ridiculous and so it be with a proud and gay smile under his mustache that he lower the operaglass and look at his cousin " but why be it you do not come to dinner " she say admire he " I must tell you about that I be busily employ and do what do you suppose I ’ll give you a hundred guess a thousand   you ’d never guess I ’ve be reconcile a husband with a

farewell dinner and at dinner they inquire who live at the top in that house no one know only their host ’s valet in answer to their inquiry whether any ' young lady ' be live on the top floor answer that there be a great many of they about there after dinner the two young man go into their host ’s study and write a letter to the unknown fair one they compose an ardent epistle a declaration in

couple a government clerk and his lady the government clerk lodge a complaint and I become a mediator and such a mediator I assure you talleyrand could not hold a candle to I " " why where be the difficulty " " ah you shall hear we apologize in due form we be in despair we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding the government clerk with the sausage begin to melt but he too desire to express his sentiment and as soon as ever he begin to express they he begin to get hot and say nasty thing and again I ’m oblige to trot out all my diplomatic talent I allow that their conduct be bad but I urge he to take into consideration their heedlessness their youth then too the young man have only just be lunch together ' you understand they regret it deeply and beg you to overlook their misbehavior ' the government clerk be soften once more ' I consent count and be ready to overlook it but you perceive that my wife — my wife ’ a respectable woman — have be expose to

we of peace for I or for you I see a chance of despair of wretchedness   or I see a chance of bliss what bliss can it be there ’ no chance of it " he murmur with his lip but she hear she strain every effort of her mind to say what ought to be say but instead of that she let her eye rest on he full of love and make no answer " it ’ come " he think in ecstasy " when I be begin to despair and it seem there would be no end — it ’ come she love I she own it " " then do this for I never say such thing to I and let we be friend " she say in word but her eye speak quite differently " friend we shall never be you know that yourself whether we shall be the happy or the wretched of people — that ’ in your hand " she would have say something but he interrupt she " I ask one thing only I ask for the

at his wife and vronsky he go up to the lady of the house and sit down for a cup of tea begin talk in his deliberate always audible voice in his habitual tone of banter ridicule someone " your rambouillet be in full conclave " he say look round at all the party " the graces and the muses " but princess betsy could not endure that tone of his—“sneere " as she call it use the english word and like a skillful hostess she at once bring he into a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription alexey alexandrovitch be immediately interested in the subject and begin seriously defend the new imperial decree against princess betsy who have attack it vronsky and anna still sit at the little table " this be get indecorous " whisper one lady with an expressive glance at madame karenina vronsky and her husband " what do I tell you " say anna ’s friend but not only those lady almost everyone in the room even the princess myakaya and betsy herself look several time in the direction of the two who have withdraw from the general circle as though that be a disturbing fact alexey alexandrovitch be the only person who do not once look in that direction and be not divert from the interesting discussion he have enter upon notice the disagreeable impression that be be make on everyone princess betsy slip someone else into her place to listen to alexey alexandrovitch and go up to anna " I ’m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband ’s language " she say " the most transcendental idea seem to be within my grasp when he ’ speak " " oh yes " say anna radiant with a smile of happiness and not understand a word of what betsy have say she cross over to the big table and take part in the general conversation alexey alexandrovitch after stay half an hour go up to his wife and suggest that they should go home together but she answer not look at he that she be stay to supper alexey alexandrovitch make his bow and withdraw the fat old tatar madame karenina ’s coachman be with difficulty hold one of her pair of gray chill with the cold and rear at the entrance a footman stand open the carriage door the hallporter stand hold open the great door of the house anna arkadyevna with her quick little hand be unfasten the lace of her sleeve catch in the hook of her fur cloak and with bent head listen to the word vronsky murmur as he escort she down " you ’ve say nothing of course and I ask nothing " he be say " but you know that friendship ’ not what I want that there ’ only one happiness in life for I that word that you dislike so   yes love " " love " she repeat slowly in an inner voice and suddenly at the very instant she unhook the lace she add " why I do not like the word be that it mean too much to I far more than you can understand " and she glance into his face " au revoir " she give he her hand and with her rapid springy step she pass by the porter and vanish into the carriage her glance the touch of her hand set he aflame he kiss the palm of his hand where she have touch it and go home happy in the sense that he have get near to the attainment of his aim that evening than during the last two month alexey alexandrovitch have see nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife be sit with vronsky at a table apart in eager conversation with he about something but he notice that to the rest of the party this appear something striking and improper and for that reason it seem to he too to be improper he make up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife on reach home alexey alexandrovitch go to his study as he usually do seat himself in his low chair open a book on the papacy at the place where he have lay the paperknife in it and read till one o’clock just as he usually do but from time to time he rub his high forehead and shake his head as though to drive away something at his usual time he get up and made his toilet for the night anna arkadyevna have not yet come in with a book under his arm he go upstairs but this evening instead of his usual thought and meditation upon official detail his thought be absorb by his wife and something disagreeable connect with she contrary to his usual habit he do not get into bed but fall to walk up and down the room with his hand clasp behind his back he could not go to bed feel that it be absolutely needful for he first to think thoroughly over the position that have just arise when alexey alexandrovitch have make up his mind that he must talk to his wife about it it have seem a very easy and simple matter but now when he begin to think over the question that have just present itself it seem to he very complicated and difficult alexey alexandrovitch be not jealous jealousy accord to his notion be an insult to one ’s wife and one ought to have confidence in one ’s wife why one ought to have confidence — that be to say complete conviction that his young wife would always love he — he do not ask himself but he have no experience of lack of confidence because he have confidence in she and tell himself that he ought to have it now though his conviction that jealousy be a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence have not break down he feel that he be stand face to face with something illogical and irrational and do not know what be to be do alexey alexandrovitch be stand face to face with life with the possibility of his wife ’s love someone other than himself and this seem to he very irrational and incomprehensible because it be life itself all his life alexey alexandrovitch have live and work in official sphere have to do with the reflection of life and every time he have stumble against life itself he have shrink away from it now he experience a feeling akin to that of a man who while calmly cross a precipice by a bridge should suddenly discover that the bridge be break and that there be a chasm below that chasm be life itself the bridge that artificial life in which alexey alexandrovitch have live for the first time the question present itself to he of the possibility of his wife ’s love someone else and he be horrified at it he do not undress but walk up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the diningroom where one lamp be burn over the carpet of the dark drawingroom in which the light be reflect on the big new portrait of himself hang over the sofa and across her boudoir where two candle burn light up the portrait of her parent and woman friend and the pretty knickknack of her writingtable that he know so well he walk across her boudoir to the bedroom door and turn back again at each turn in his walk especially at the parquet of the lighted diningroom he halt and say to himself " yes this I must decide and put a stop to I must express my view of it and my decision " and he turn back again " but express what — what decision " he say to himself in the drawingroom and he find no reply " but after all " he ask himself before turn into the boudoir " what have occur nothing she be talk a long while with he but what of that surely woman in society can talk to whom they please and then jealousy mean lower both myself and she " he tell himself as he go into her boudoir but this dictum which have always have such weight with he before have now no weight and no meaning at all and from the bedroom door he turn back again but as he enter the dark drawingroom some inner voice tell he that it be not so and that if other notice it that show that there be something and he say to himself again in the diningroom " yes I must decide and put a stop to it and express my view of it " and again at the turn in the drawingroom he ask himself " decide how " and again he ask himself " what have occur " and answer " nothing " and recollect that jealousy be a feeling insulting to his wife but again in the drawingroom he be convinced that something have happen his thought like his body go round a complete circle without come upon anything new he notice this rub his forehead and sit down in her boudoir there look at her table with the malachite blotting case lie at the top and an unfinished letter his thought suddenly change he begin to think of she of what she be think and feel for the first time he picture vividly to himself her personal life her idea her desire and the idea that she could and should have a separate life of her own seem to he so alarming that he make haste to dispel it it be the chasm which he be afraid to peep into to put himself in thought and feeling in another person ’s place be a spiritual exercise not natural to alexey alexandrovitch he look on this spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy " and the bad of it all " think he " be that just now at the very moment when my great work be approach completion " he be think of the project he be bring forward at the time " when I stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energy just now this stupid worry should fall foul of I but what ’ to be do I ’m not one of those man who submit to uneasiness and worry without have the force of character to face they " I must think it over come to a decision and put it out of my mind " he say aloud " the question of her feeling of what have pass and may be pass in her soul that ’ not my affair that ’ the affair of her conscience and fall under the head of religion " he say to himself feel consolation in the sense that he have find to which division of regulate principle this new circumstance could be properly refer " and so " alexey alexandrovitch say to himself " question as to her feeling and so on be question for her conscience with which I can have nothing to do my duty be clearly define as the head of the family I be a person bind in duty to guide she and consequently in part the person responsible I be bind to point out the danger I perceive to warn she even to use my authority I ought to speak plainly to she " and everything that he would say tonight to his wife take clear shape in alexey alexandrovitch ’s head think over what he would say he somewhat regret that he should have to use his time and mental power for domestic consumption with so little to show for it but in spite of that the form and content of the speech before he shape itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report " I must say and express fully the follow point first exposition of the value to be attach to public opinion and to decorum secondly exposition of religious significance of marriage thirdly if need be reference to the calamity possibly ensue to our son fourthly reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself " and interlace his finger alexey alexandrovitch stretch they and the joint of the finger crack this trick a bad habit the cracking of his finger always soothe he and give precision to his thought so needful to he at this juncture there be the sound of a carriage drive up to the front door alexey alexandrovitch halt in the middle of the room a woman ’s step be hear mount the stair alexey alexandrovitch ready for his speech stand compress his cross finger wait to see if the crack would not come again one joint crack already from the sound of light step on the stair he be aware that she be close and though he be satisfied with his speech he feel frightened of the explanation confront he anna come in with hang head play with the tassel of her hood her face be brilliant and glow but this glow be not one of brightness it suggest the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night on see her husband anna raise her head and smile as though she have just wake up " you ’re not in bed what a wonder " she say let fall her hood and without stop she go on into the dressingroom " it ’ late alexey alexandrovitch " she say when she have go through the doorway " anna it ’ necessary for I to have a talk with you " " with I " she say wonderingly she come out from behind the door of the dressingroom and look at he " why what be it what about " she ask sit down " well let ’s talk if it ’ so necessary but it would be well to get to sleep " anna say what come to her lip and marvel hear herself at her own capacity for lie how simple and natural be her word and how likely that she be simply sleepy she feel herself clothe in an impenetrable armor of falsehood she feel that some unseen force have come to her aid and be support she " anna I must warn you " he begin " warn I " she say " of what " she look at he so simply so brightly that anyone who do not know she as her husband know she could not have notice anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her word but to he know she know that whenever he go to bed five minute later than usual she notice it and ask he the reason to he know that every joy every pleasure and pain that she feel she communicate to he at once to he now to see that she do not care to notice his state of mind that she do not care to say a word about herself mean a great deal he see that the inmost recess of her soul that have always hitherto lie open before he be close against he more than that he see from her tone that she be not even perturbed at that but as it be say straight out to he " yes it ’ shut up and so it must be and will be in future " now he experience a feeling such as a man might have return home and find his own house lock up " but perhaps the key may yet be find " think alexey alexandrovitch " I want to warn you " he say in a low voice " that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talk about in society your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky " he enunciate the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis " attract attention " he talk and look at her laugh eye which frighten he now with their impenetrable look and as he talk he feel all the uselessness and idleness of his word " you ’re always like that " she answer as though completely misapprehend he and of all he have say only take in the last phrase " one time you do not like my be dull and another time you do not like my be lively I be not dull do that offend you " alexey alexandrovitch shiver and bend his hand to make the joint crack " oh please do not do that I do so dislike it " she say " anna be this you " say alexey alexandrovitch quietly make an effort over himself and restrain the motion of his finger " but what be it all about " she say with such genuine and droll wonder " what do you want of I " alexey alexandrovitch pause and rub his forehead and his eye he see that instead of do as he have intend — that be to say warn his wife against a mistake in the eye of the world — he have unconsciously become agitated over what be the affair of her conscience and be struggle against the barrier he fancy between they " this be what I mean to say to you " he go on coldly and composedly " and I beg you to listen to it I consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and I shall never allow myself to be influence by it but there be certain rule of decorum which can not be disregard with impunity this evening it be not I observe it but judge by the impression make on the company everyone observe that your conduct and deportment be not altogether what could be desire " " I positively do not understand " say anna shrug her shoulders—“he do not care " she think " but other people notice it and that ’ what upset him”—“you’re not well alexey alexandrovitch " she add and she get up and would have go towards the door but he move forward as though he would stop she his face be ugly and forbidding as anna have never see he she stop and bend her head back and on one side begin with her rapid hand take out her hairpin " well I ’m listen to what ’ to come " she say calmly and ironically " and indeed I listen with interest for I should like to understand what ’ the matter " she speak and marvel at the confident calm and natural tone in which she be speak and the choice of the word she use " to enter into all the detail of your feeling I have no right and besides I regard that as useless and even harmful " begin alexey alexandrovitch " ferret in one ’s soul one often ferret out something that might have lie there unnoticed your feeling be an affair of your own conscience but I be in duty bind to you to myself and to god to point out to you your duty our life have be join not by man but by god that union can only be sever by a crime and a crime of that nature bring its own chastisement " " I do not understand a word and oh dear how sleepy I be unluckily " she say rapidly pass her hand through her hair feel for the remain hairpin " anna for god ’s sake do not speak like that " he say gently " perhaps I be mistaken but believe I what I say I say as much for myself as for you I be your husband and I love you " for an instant her face fall and the mocking gleam in her eye die away but the word love throw she into revolt again she think " love can he love if he have not hear there be such a thing as love he would never have use the word he do not even know what love be " " alexey alexandrovitch really I do not understand " she say " define what it be you find " " pardon let I you all I have to say I love you but I be not speak of myself the most important person in this matter be our son and yourself it may very well be I repeat that my word seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place it may be that they be call forth by my mistaken impression in that case I beg you to forgive I but if you be conscious yourself of even the small foundation for they then I beg you to think a little and if your heart prompt you to speak out to I " alexey alexandrovitch be unconsciously say something utterly unlike what he have prepare " I have nothing to say and besides " she say hurriedly with difficulty repress a smile " it ’ really time to be in bed " alexey alexandrovitch sigh and without say more go into the bedroom when she come into the bedroom he be already in bed his lip be sternly compress and his eye look away from she anna get into her bed and lie expect every minute that he would begin to speak to she again she both fear his speaking and wish for it but he be silent she wait for a long while without move and have forget about he she think of that other she picture he and feel how her heart be flood with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of he suddenly she hear an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexey alexandrovitch seem as it be appal at his own snoring and cease but after an interval of two breathing the snore sound again with a new tranquil rhythm " it ’ late it ’ late " she whisper with a smile a long while she lie not move with open eye whose brilliance she almost fancy she could herself see in the darkness from that time a new life begin for alexey alexandrovitch and for his wife nothing special happen anna go out into society as she have always do be particularly often at princess betsy ’s and meet vronsky everywhere alexey alexandrovitch see this but could do nothing all his effort to draw she into open discussion she confront with a barrier which he could not penetrate make up of a sort of amused perplexity outwardly everything be the same but their inner relation be completely change alexey alexandrovitch a man of great power in the world of politic feel himself helpless in this like an ox with head bend submissively he await the blow which he feel be lift over he every time he begin to think about it he feel that he must try once more that by kindness tenderness and persuasion there be still hope of save she of bring she back to herself and every day he make ready to talk to she but every time he begin talk to she he feel that the spirit of evil and deceit which have take possession of she have possession of he too and he talk to she in a tone quite unlike that in which he have mean to talk involuntarily he talk to she in his habitual tone of jeer at anyone who should say what he be say and in that tone it be impossible to say what need to be say to she that which for vronsky have be almost a whole year the one absorb desire of his life replace all his old desire that which for anna have be an impossible terrible and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss that desire have be fulfil he stand before she pale his low jaw quiver and beseech she to be calm not know how or why " anna anna " he say with a choking voice " anna for pity ’s sake " but the louder he speak the low she drop her once proud and gay now shamestricken head and she bow down and sink from the sofa where she be sit down on the floor at his foot she would have fall on the carpet if he have not hold she " my god forgive I " she say sob press his hand to her bosom she feel so sinful so guilty that nothing be leave she but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness and as now there be no one in her life but he to he she address her prayer for forgiveness look at he she have a physical sense of her humiliation and she could say nothing more he feel what a murderer must feel when he see the body he have rob of life that body rob by he of life be their love the first stage of their love there be something awful and revolting in the memory of what have be buy at this fearful price of shame shame at their spiritual nakedness crush she and infect he but in spite of all the murderer ’s horror before the body of his victim he must hack it to piece hide the body must use what he have gain by his murder and with fury as it be with passion the murderer fall on the body and drag it and hack at it so he cover her face and shoulder with kiss she hold his hand and do not stir " yes these kiss — that be what have be buy by this shame yes and one hand which will always be mine — the hand of my accomplice " she lift up that hand and kiss it he sink on his knee and try to see her face but she hide it and say nothing at last as though make an effort over herself she get up and push he away her face be still as beautiful but it be only the more pitiful for that " all be over " she say " I have nothing but you remember that " " I can never forget what be my whole life for one instant of this happiness " " happiness " she say with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infect he " for pity ’s sake not a word not a word more " she rise quickly and move away from he " not a word more " she repeat and with a look of chill despair incomprehensible to he she part from he she feel that at that moment she could not put into word the sense of shame of rapture and of horror at this step into a new life and she do not want to speak of it to vulgarize this feel by inappropriate word but later too and the next day and the third day she still find no word in which she could express the complexity of her feeling indeed she could not even find thought in which she could clearly think out all that be in her soul she say to herself " no just now I can not think of it later on when I be calm " but this calm for thought never come every time the thought rise of what she have do and what would happen to she and what she ought to do a horror come over she and she drive those thought away " later later " she said—“when I be calm " but in dream when she have no control over her thought her position present itself to she in all its hideous nakedness one dream haunt she almost every night she dream that both be her husband at once that both be lavish caress on she alexey alexandrovitch be weep kiss her hand and say " how happy we be now " and alexey vronsky be there too and he too be her husband and she be marvel that it have once seem impossible to she be explain to they laugh that this be ever so much simple and that now both of they be happy and contented but this dream weigh on she like a nightmare and she awake from it in terror in the early day after his return from moscow whenever levin shudder and grow red remember the disgrace of his rejection he say to himself " this be just how I use to shudder and blush think myself utterly lose when I be pluck in physics and do not get my remove and how I think myself utterly ruin after I have mismanage that affair of my sister ’s that be entrust to I and yet now that year have pass I recall it and wonder that it could distress I so much it will be the same thing too with this trouble time will go by and I shall not mind about this either " but three month have pass and he have not leave off mind about it and it be as painful for he to think of it as it have be those first day he could not be at peace because after dream so long of family life and feel himself so ripe for it he be still not married and be furth than ever from marriage he be painfully conscious himself as be all about he that at his year it be not well for man to be alone he remember how before start for moscow he have once say to his cowman nikolay a simplehearted peasant whom he like talk to " well nikolay I mean to get marry " and how nikolay have promptly answer as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt " and high time too konstantin dmitrievitch " but marriage have now become far off than ever the place be take and whenever he try to imagine any of the girl he know in that place he feel that it be utterly impossible moreover the recollection of the rejection and the part he have play in the affair torture he with shame however often he tell himself that he be in no wise to blame in it that recollection like other humiliating reminiscence of a similar kind make he twinge and blush there have be in his past as in every man ’s action recognize by he as bad for which his conscience ought to have torment he but the memory of these evil action be far from cause he so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscence these wound never heal and with these memory be now range his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have appear to other that evening but time and work do their part bitter memory be more and more cover up by the incident — paltry in his eye but really important — of his country life every week he think less often of kitty he be impatiently look forward to the news that she be marry or just go to be marry hope that such news would like have a tooth out completely cure he meanwhile spring come on beautiful and kindly without the delay and treachery of spring — one of those rare spring in which plant beast and man rejoice alike this lovely spring rouse levin still more and strengthen he in his resolution of renounce all his past and build up his lonely life firmly and independently though many of the plan with which he have return to the country have not be carry out still his most important resolution — that of purity — have be keep by he he be free from that shame which have usually harass he after a fall and he could look everyone straight in the face in february he have receive a letter from marya nikolaevna tell he that his brother nikolay ’s health be get bad but that he would not take advice and in consequence of this letter levin go to moscow to his brother ’s and succeed in persuade he to see a doctor and to go to a wateringplace abroad he succeed so well in persuade his brother and in lend he money for the journey without irritate he that he be satisfied with himself in that matter in addition to his farming which call for special attention in spring and in addition to read levin have begin that winter a work on agriculture the plan of which turn on take into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable datum of the question like the climate and the soil and consequently deduce all the principle of scientific culture not simply from the datum of soil and climate but from the datum of soil climate and a certain unalterable character of the laborer thus in spite of his solitude or in consequence of his solitude his life be exceedingly full only rarely he suffer from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray idea to someone besides agafea mihalovna with she indeed he not infrequently fall into discussion upon physics the theory of agriculture and especially philosophy philosophy be agafea mihalovna ’s favorite subject spring be slow in unfolding for the last few week it have be steadily fine frosty weather in the daytime it thaw in the sun but at night there be even seven degree of frost there be such a frozen surface on the snow that they drive the wagon anywhere off the road easter come in the snow then all of a sudden on easter monday a warm wind spring up storm cloud swoop down and for three day and three night the warm drive rain fall in stream on thursday the wind drop and a thick gray fog brood over the land as though hide the mystery of the transformation that be be work in nature behind the fog there be the flowing of water the cracking and floating of ice the swift rush of turbid foam torrent and on the follow monday in the evening the fog part the storm cloud split up into little curl crest of cloud the sky clear and the real spring have come in the morning the sun rise brilliant and quickly wear away the thin layer of ice that cover the water and all the warm air be quiver with the steam that rise up from the quickened earth the old grass look green and the young grass thrust up its tiny blade the bud of the guelderrose and of the currant and the sticky birchbud be swollen with sap and an explore bee be hum about the golden blossom that stud the willow lark trill unseen above the velvety green field and the icecovered stubbleland peewit wail over the low land and marsh flood by the pool crane and wild goose fly high across the sky utter their spring call the cattle bald in patch where the new hair have not grow yet low in the pasture the bowlegged lamb frisk round their bleat mother nimble child run about the dry path cover with the print of bare foot there be a merry chatter of peasant woman over their linen at the pond and the ring of axis in the yard where the peasant be repair plough and harrow the real spring have come levin put on his big boot and for the first time a cloth jacket instead of his fur cloak and go out to look after his farm step over stream of water that flash in the sunshine and dazzle his eye and tread one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud spring be the time of plan and project and as he come out into the farmyard levin like a tree in spring that know not what form will be take by the young shoot and twig imprison in its swell bud hardly know what undertaking he be go to begin upon now in the farm work that be so dear to he but he feel that he be full of the most splendid plan and project first of all he go to the cattle the cow have be let out into their paddock and their smooth side be already shine with their new sleek spring coat they bask in the sunshine and low to go to the meadow levin gaze admiringly at the cow he know so intimately to the minute detail of their condition and give order for they to be drive out into the meadow and the calf to be let into the paddock the herdsman run gaily to get ready for the meadow the cowherd girl pick up their petticoat run splash through the mud with bare leg still white not yet brown from the sun wave brush wood in their hand chase the calf that frolic in the mirth of spring after admire the young one of that year who be particularly fine — the early calf be the size of a peasant ’s cow and pava ’s daughter at three month old be as big as a yearling — levin give order for a trough to be bring out and for they to be feed in the paddock but it appear that as the paddock have not be use during the winter the hurdle make in the autumn for it be break he send for the carpenter who accord to his order ought to have be at work at the thrash machine but it appear that the carpenter be repair the harrow which ought to have be repair before lent this be very annoying to levin it be annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he have be strive with all his might for so many year the hurdle as he ascertain be not want in winter have be carry to the carthorse ' stable and there broken as they be of light construction only mean for feed calf moreover it be apparent also that the harrow and all the agricultural implement which he have direct to be look over and repair in the winter for which very purpose he have hire three carpenter have not be put into repair and the harrow be be repair when they ought to have be harrowing the field levin send for his bailiff but immediately go off himself to look for he the bailiff beam all over like everyone that day in a sheepskin border with astrachan come out of the barn twist a bit of straw in his hand " why be not the carpenter at the thrash machine " " oh I mean to tell you yesterday the harrow want repair here it ’ time they get to work in the field " " but what be they do in the winter then " " but what do you want the carpenter for " " where be the hurdle for the calf ' paddock " " I order they to be get ready what would you have with those peasant " say the bailiff with a wave of his hand " it ’ not those peasant but this bailiff " say levin get angry " why what do I keep you for " he cry but bethink himself that this would not help matter he stop short in the middle of a sentence and merely sigh " well what do you say can sowing begin " he ask after a pause " behind turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin " " and the clover " " I ’ve send vassily and mishka they ’re sow only I do not know if they ’ll manage to get through it ’ so slushy " " how many acre " " about fifteen " " why not sow all " cry levin that they be only sow the clover on fifteen acre not on all the fortyfive be still more annoying to he clover as he know both from book and from his own experience never do well except when it be sow as early as possible almost in the snow and yet levin could never get this do " there ’ no one to send what would you have with such a set of peasant three have not turn up and there ’ semyon " " well you should have take some man from the thatching " " and so I have as it be " " where be the peasant then " " five be make compôte " which mean compost " four be shift the oats for fear of a touch of mildew konstantin dmitrievitch " levin know very well that " a touch of mildew " mean that his english seed oats be already ruin again they have not do as he have order " why but I tell you during lent to put in pipe " he cry " do not put yourself out we shall get it all do in time " levin wave his hand angrily go into the granary to glance at the oats and then to the stable the oats be not yet spoil but the peasant be carry the oats in spade when they might simply let they slide down into the low granary and arrange for this to be do and take two workman from there for sow clover levin get over his vexation with the bailiff indeed it be such a lovely day that one could not be angry " ignat " he call to the coachman who with his sleeve tuck up be wash the carriage wheel " saddle I " " which sir " " well let it be kolpik " " yes sir " while they be saddle his horse levin again call up the bailiff who be hang about in sight to make it up with he and begin talk to he about the spring operation before they and his plan for the farm the wagon be to begin cart manure early so as to get all do before the early mowing and the ploughing of the further land to go on without a break so as to let it ripen lie fallow and the mowing to be all do by hire labor not on halfprofits the bailiff listen attentively and obviously make an effort to approve of his employer ’s project but still he have that look levin know so well that always irritate he a look of hopelessness and despondency that look say " that ’ all very well but as god will " nothing mortify levin so much as that tone but it be the tone common to all the bailiff he have ever have they have all take up that attitude to his plan and so now he be not anger by it but mortify and feel all the more roused to struggle against this as it seem elemental force continually range against he for which he could find no other expression than " as god will " " if we can manage it konstantin dmitrievitch " say the bailiff " why ever should not you manage it " " we positively must have another fifteen laborer and they do not turn up there be some here today ask seventy rouble for the summer " levin be silent again he be bring face to face with that oppose force he know that however much they try they could not hire more than forty — thirtyseven perhaps or thirtyeight — laborer for a reasonable sum some forty have be take on and there be no more but still he could not help struggle against it " send to sury to tchefirovka if they do not come we must look for they " " oh I ’ll send to be sure " say vassily fedorovitch despondently " but there be the horse too they ’re not good for much " " we ’ll get some more I know of course " levin add laugh " you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible but this year I ’m not go to let you have thing your own way I ’ll see to everything myself " " why I do not think you take much rest as it be it cheer we up to work under the master ’s eye " " so they ’re sow clover behind the birch dale I ’ll go and have a look at they " he say get on to the little bay cob kolpik who be lead up by the coachman " you can not get across the stream konstantin dmitrievitch " the coachman shout " all right I ’ll go by the forest " and levin ride through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country his good little horse after his long inactivity step out gallantly snort over the pool and ask as it be for guidance if levin have feel happy before in the cattle pen and farmyard he feel happy yet in the open country sway rhythmically with the amble pace of his good little cob drink in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he ride through his forest over the crumble wasted snow still leave in part and cover with dissolve track he rejoice over every tree with the moss revive on its bark and the bud swell on its shoot when he come out of the forest in the immense plain before he his grass field stretch in an unbroken carpet of green without one bare place or swamp only spot here and there in the hollow with patch of melt snow he be not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasant ' horse and colt trample down his young grass he tell a peasant he meet to drive they out nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat whom he meet on the way and ask " well ipat shall we soon be sow " " we must get the ploughing do first konstantin dmitrievitch " answer ipat the far he ride the happy he become and plan for the land rise to his mind each well than the last to plant all his field with hedge along the southern border so that the snow should not lie under they to divide they up into six field of arable and three of pasture and hay to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate and to dig a pond and to construct movable pen for the cattle as a means of manure the land and then eight hundred acre of wheat three hundred of potato and four hundred of clover and not one acre exhaust absorb in such dream carefully keep his horse by the hedge so as not to trample his young crop he ride up to the laborer who have be send to sow clover a cart with the seed in it be stand not at the edge but in the middle of the crop and the winter corn have be tear up by the wheel and trample by the horse both the laborer be sit in the hedge probably smoke a pipe together the earth in the cart with which the seed be mix be not crush to powder but crust together or adhere in clod see the master the laborer vassily go towards the cart while mishka set to work sow this be not as it should be but with the laborer levin seldom lose his temper when vassily come up levin tell he to lead the horse to the hedge " it ’ all right sir it ’ll spring up again " respond vassily " please do not argue " say levin " but do as you ’re tell " " yes sir " answer vassily and he take the horse ’s head " what a sowing konstantin dmitrievitch " he say hesitate " first rate only it ’ a work to get about you drag a ton of earth on your shoe " " why be it you have earth that ’ not sift " say levin " well we crumble it up " answer vassily take up some seed and roll the earth in his palm vassily be not to blame for their have fill up his cart with unsifted earth but still it be annoy levin have more than once already try a way he know for stifle his anger and turn all that seem dark right again and he try that way now he watch how mishka stride along swinge the huge clod of earth that cling to each foot and get off his horse he take the sieve from vassily and start sow himself " where do you stop " vassily point to the mark with his foot and levin go forward as well he could scatter the seed on the land walking be as difficult as on a bog and by the time levin have end the row he be in a great heat and he stop and give up the sieve to vassily " well master when summer ’ here mind you do not scold I for these row " say vassily " eh " say levin cheerily already feel the effect of his method " why you ’ll see in the summer time it ’ll look different look you where I sow last spring how I do work at it I do my good konstantin dmitrievitch d’ye see as I would for my own father I do not like bad work myself nor would I let another man do it what ’ good for the master ’ good for we too to look out yonder now " say vassily point " it do one ’s heart good " " it ’ a lovely spring vassily " " why it ’ a spring such as the old man do not remember the like of I be up home an old man up there have sow wheat too about an acre of it he be say you would not know it from rye " " have you be sow wheat long " " why sir it be you teach we the year before last you give I two measure we sell about eight bushel and sow a rood " " well mind you crumble up the clod " say levin go towards his horse " and keep an eye on mishka and if there ’ a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre " " humbly thankful we be very well content sir as it be " levin get on his horse and ride towards the field where be last year ’s clover and the one which be plough ready for the spring corn the crop of clover come up in the stubble be magnificent it have survive everything and stand up vividly green through the broken stalk of last year ’s wheat the horse sink in up to the pastern and he draw each hoof with a suck sound out of the halfthawed ground over the ploughland riding be utterly impossible the horse could only keep a foothold where there be ice and in the thaw furrow he sink deep in at each step the ploughland be in splendid condition in a couple of day it would be fit for harrowing and sow everything be capital everything be cheer levin ride back across the stream hope the water would have go down and he do in fact get across and startle two duck " there must be snipe too " he think and just as he reach the turn homeward he meet the forest keeper who confirm his theory about the snipe levin go home at a trot so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening as he ride up to the house in the happy frame of mind levin hear the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house " yes that ’ someone from the railway station " he think " just the time to be here from the moscow train   who could it be what if it ’ brother nikolay he do say ' maybe I ’ll go to the waters or maybe I ’ll come down to you ' " he feel dismayed and vexed for the first minute that his brother nikolay ’s presence should come to disturb his happy mood of spring but he feel ashamed of the feeling and at once he open as it be the arm of his soul and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation now he hope with all his heart that it be his brother he prick up his horse and ride out from behind the acacia he see a hire threehorse sledge from the railway station and a gentleman in a fur coat it be not his brother " oh if it be only some nice person one could talk to a little " he think " ah " cry levin joyfully fling up both his hand " here ’ a delightful visitor ah how glad I be to see you " he shout recognize stepan arkadyevitch " I shall find out for certain whether she ’ marry or when she ’ go to be marry " he think and on that delicious spring day he feel that the thought of she do not hurt he at all " well you do not expect I eh " say stepan arkadyevitch get out of the sledge splash with mud on the bridge of his nose on his cheek and on his eyebrow but radiant with health and good spirit " I ’ve come to see you in the first place " he say embrace and kiss he " to have some standshooting second and to sell the forest at ergushovo third " " delightful what a spring we ’re have how ever do you get along in a sledge " " in a cart it would have be bad still konstantin dmitrievitch " answer the driver who know he " well I ’m very very glad to see you " say levin with a genuine smile of childlike delight levin lead his friend to the room set apart for visitor where stepan arkadyevitch ’s thing be carry also — a bag a gun in a case a satchel for cigar leave he there to wash and change his clothe levin go off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and clover agafea mihalovna always very anxious for the credit of the house meet he in the hall with inquiry about dinner " do just as you like only let it be as soon as possible " he say and go to the bailiff when he come back stepan arkadyevitch wash and comb come out of his room with a beaming smile and they go upstairs together " well I be glad I manage to get away to you now I shall understand what the mysterious business be that you be always absorb in here no really I envy you what a house how nice it all be so bright so cheerful " say stepan arkadyevitch forget that it be not always spring and fine weather like that day " and your nurse be simply charm a pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable perhaps but for your severe monastic style it do very well " stepan arkadyevitch tell he many interesting piece of news especially interesting to levin be the news that his brother sergey ivanovitch be intend to pay he a visit in the summer not one word do stepan arkadyevitch say in reference to kitty and the shtcherbatsky he merely give he greeting from his wife levin be grateful to he for his delicacy and be very glad of his visitor as always happen with he during his solitude a mass of idea and feeling have be accumulate within he which he could not communicate to those about he and now he pour out upon stepan arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring and his failure and plan for the land and his thought and criticism on the book he have be read and the idea of his own book the basis of which really be though he be unaware of it himself a criticism of all the old book on agriculture stepan arkadyevitch always charm understand everything at the slight reference be particularly charming on this visit and levin notice in he a special tenderness as it be and a new tone of respect that flatter he the effort of agafea mihalovna and the cook that the dinner should be particularly good only end in the two famished friend attack the preliminary course eat a great deal of bread and butter salt goose and salt mushroom and in levin ’s finally order the soup to be serve without the accompaniment of little pie with which the cook have particularly mean to impress their visitor but though stepan arkadyevitch be accustom to very different dinner he think everything excellent the herb brandy and the bread and the butter and above all the salt goose and the mushroom and the nettle soup and the chicken in white sauce and the white crimean wine — everything be superb and delicious " splendid splendid " he say light a fat cigar after the roast " I feel as if come to you I have land on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer and so you maintain that the laborer himself be an element to be study and to regulate the choice of method in agriculture of course I ’m an ignorant outsider but I should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too " " yes but wait a bit I ’m not talk of political economy I ’m talk of the science of agriculture it ought to be like the natural science and to observe give phenomenon and the laborer in his economic ethnographical " at that instant agafea mihalovna come in with jam " oh agafea mihalovna " say stepan arkadyevitch kiss the tip of his plump finger " what salt goose what herb brandy what do you think be not it time to start kostya " he add levin look out of the window at the sun sink behind the bare treetop of the forest " yes it ’ time " he say " kouzma get ready the trap " and he run downstairs stepan arkadyevitch go down carefully take the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own hand and open it begin to get ready his expensive newfashioned gun kouzma who already scent a big tip never leave stepan arkadyevitch ’s side and put on he both his stocking and boot a task which stepan arkadyevitch readily leave he " kostya give order that if the merchant ryabinin come   I tell he to come today he ’ to be bring in and to wait for I " " why do you mean to say you ’re sell the forest to ryabinin " " yes do you know he " " to be sure I do I have have to do business with he ' positively and conclusively ' " stepan arkadyevitch laugh " positively and conclusively " be the merchant ’s favorite word " yes it ’ wonderfully funny the way he talk she know where her master ’ go " he add pat laska who hang about levin whine and lick his hand his boot and his gun the trap be already at the step when they go out " I tell they to bring the trap round or would you rather walk " " no we ’d well drive " say stepan arkadyevitch get into the trap he sit down tuck the tigerskin rug round he and light a cigar " how be it you do not smoke a cigar be a sort of thing not exactly a pleasure but the crown and outward sign of pleasure come this be life how splendid it be this be how I should like to live " " why who prevent you " say levin smile " no you ’re a lucky man you ’ve get everything you like you like horse — and you have they dog — you have they shoot — you have it farm — you have it " " perhaps because I rejoice in what I have and do not fret for what I have not " say levin think of kitty stepan arkadyevitch comprehend look at he but say nothing levin be grateful to oblonsky for notice with his neverfaile tact that he dread conversation about the shtcherbatskys and so say nothing about they but now levin be long to find out what be torment he so yet he have not the courage to begin " come tell I how thing be go with you " say levin bethink himself that it be not nice of he to think only of himself stepan arkadyevitch ’s eye sparkle merrily " you do not admit I know that one can be fond of new roll when one have have one ’s ration of bread — to your mind it ’ a crime but I do not count life as life without love " he say take levin ’s question his own way " what be I to do I ’m make that way and really one do so little harm to anyone and give oneself so much pleasure " " what be there something new then " query levin " yes my boy there be there do you see you know the type of ossian ’s woman woman such as one see in dream well these woman be sometimes to be meet in reality   and these woman be terrible woman do not you know be such a subject that however much you study it it ’ always perfectly new " " well then it would be well not to study it " " no some mathematician have say that enjoyment lie in the search for truth not in the find it " levin listen in silence and in spite of all the effort he make he could not in the least enter into the feeling of his friend and understand his sentiment and the charm of study such woman the place fix on for the standshooting be not far above a stream in a little aspen copse on reach the copse levin get out of the trap and lead oblonsky to a corner of a mossy swampy glade already quite free from snow he go back himself to a double birch tree on the other side and lean his gun on the fork of a dead low branch he take off his full overcoat fasten his belt again and work his arm to see if they be free gray old laska who have follow they sit down warily opposite he and prick up her ear the sun be set behind a thick forest and in the glow of sunset the birch tree dot about in the aspen copse stand out clearly with their hang twig and their bud swell almost to burst from the thick part of the copse where the snow still remain come the faint sound of narrow wind thread of water run away tiny bird twitter and now and then flutter from tree to tree in the pause of complete stillness there come the rustle of last year ’s leave stir by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass " imagine one can hear and see the grass grow " levin say to himself notice a wet slatecolored aspen leaf move beside a blade of young grass he stand listen and gaze sometimes down at the wet mossy ground sometimes at laska listen all alert sometimes at the sea of bare tree top that stretch on the slope below he sometimes at the darken sky cover with white streak of cloud a hawk fly high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wing another fly with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanish the bird twitter more and more loudly and busily in the thicket an owl hoot not far off and laska start step cautiously a few step forward and put her head on one side begin to listen intently beyond the stream be hear the cuckoo twice she utter her usual cuckoo call and then give a hoarse hurried call and break down " imagine the cuckoo already " say stepan arkadyevitch come out from behind a bush " yes I hear it " answer levin reluctantly break the stillness with his voice which sound disagreeable to himself " now it ’ come " stepan arkadyevitch ’s figure again go behind the bush and levin see nothing but the bright flash of a match follow by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette " tchk tchk " come the snap sound of stepan arkadyevitch cock his gun " what ’ that cry " ask oblonsky draw levin ’s attention to a prolonged cry as though a colt be whinny in a high voice in play " oh do not you know it that ’ the hare but enough talking listen it ’ fly " almost shriek levin cock his gun they hear a shrill whistle in the distance and in the exact time so well know to the sportsman two second later — another a third and after the third whistle the hoarse guttural cry could be hear levin look about he to right and to left and there just face he against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoot of the aspen he see the fly bird it be fly straight towards he the guttural cry like the even tearing of some strong stuff sound close to his ear the long beak and neck of the bird could be see and at the very instant when levin be take aim behind the bush where oblonsky stand there be a flash of red lightning the bird drop like an arrow and dart upwards again again come the red flash and the sound of a blow and flutter its wing as though try to keep up in the air the bird halt stop still an instant and fall with a heavy splash on the slushy ground " can I have miss

prolong the pleasure and as it be smile bring the dead bird to her master " well I ’m glad you be successful " say levin who at the same time have a sense of envy that he have not succeed in shoot the snipe " it be a bad shot from the right barrel " respond stepan arkadyevitch load his gun " sh it ’ fly " the shrill whistle rapidly follow one another be hear again two snipe play and chase one another and only whistle not cry fly straight at the very head of the sportsman there be the report of four shot and like swallow the snipe turn swift somersault in the air and vanish from sight the standshooting be capital stepan arkadyevitch shoot two more bird and levin two of which one be not find it begin to get dark venus bright and silvery shine with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch tree and high up in the east twinkle the red light of arcturus over his head levin make out the star of the great bear and lose they again the snipe have cease fly but levin resolve to stay a little long till venus which he see below a branch of birch should be above it and the star of the great bear should be perfectly plain venus have rise above the branch and the ear of the great bear with its shaft be now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky yet still he wait " be not it time to go home " say stepan arkadyevitch it be quite still now in the copse and not a bird be stir " let ’s stay a little while " answer levin " as you like " they be stand now about fifteen pace from one another " stiva " say levin unexpectedly " how be it you do not tell I whether your

think of be marry and be not think of it but she ’ very ill and the doctor have send she abroad they ’re positively afraid she may not live " " what " cry levin " very ill what be wrong with she how have she " while they be say this laska with ear prick up be look upwards at the sky and reproachfully at they " they have choose a time to talk " she be think " it ’ on the wing here it be yes it be they ’ll miss it " think laska but at that very instant both suddenly hear a shrill whistle which as it be smite on their ear and both suddenly seize their gun and two flash gleam and two bang sound at the very same instant the snipe fly high above instantly fold its wing and fall into a thicket bend down the delicate shoot " splendid together " cry levin and he run with laska into the thicket to look for the snipe " oh yes what be it that be unpleasant " he wonder " yes kitty ’ ill well it can not be help I ’m very sorry " he think " she ’ find it be not she a clever thing " he say take the warm bird from laska ’s mouth and pack it into the almost full game bag " I ’ve get it stiva " he shout on the way home levin ask all detail of kitty ’s illness and the shtcherbatsky ' plan and though he would have be ashamed to admit it he be pleased at what he hear he be pleased that there be still hope and still more pleased that she should be suffer who have make he suffer so much but when stepan arkadyevitch begin to speak of the cause of kitty ’s illness and mention vronsky ’s name levin cut he short " I have no right whatever to know family matter and to tell the truth no interest in they either " stepan arkadyevitch smile hardly perceptibly catch the instantaneous change he know so well in levin ’s face which have become as gloomy as it have be bright a minute before " have you quite settle about the forest with ryabinin " ask levin " yes it ’ settle the price be magnificent thirtyeight thousand eight straight away and the rest in six year I ’ve be bother about it for ever so long no one would give more " " then you ’ve as good as give away your forest for nothing " say levin gloomily " how do you mean for nothing " say stepan arkadyevitch with a goodhumored smile know that nothing would be right in levin ’s eye now " because the forest be worth at least a hundred and fifty rouble the acre " answer levin " oh these farmer " say stepan arkadyevitch playfully " your tone of contempt for we poor townsfolk but when it come to business we do it well than anyone I assure you I have reckon it all out " he say " and the forest be fetch a very good price — so much so that I ’m afraid of this fellow ’s cry off in fact you know it ’ not ' timber ' " say stepan arkadyevitch hope by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubt " and it will not run to more than twentyfive yard of fagot per acre and he ’ give I at the rate of seventy rouble the acre " levin smile contemptuously " I know " he think " that fashion not only in he but in all city people who after be twice in ten year in the country pick up two or three phrase and use they in season and out of season firmly persuade that they know all about it ' timber run to so many yard the acre ' he say those word without understand they himself " " i would not attempt to teach you what you write about in your office " say he " and if need arise I should come to you to ask about it but you ’re so positive you know all the lore of the forest it ’ difficult have you count the tree " " how count the tree " say stepan arkadyevitch laugh still try to draw his friend out of his illtemper " count the sand of the sea number the star some high power might do it " " oh well the high power of ryabinin can not a single merchant ever buy a forest without count the tree unless they get it give they for nothing as you ’re do now I know your forest I go there every year shoot and your forest ’ worth a hundred and fifty rouble an acre pay down while he ’ give you sixty by installment so that in fact you ’re make he a present of thirty thousand " " come do not let your imagination run away with you " say stepan arkadyevitch piteously " why be it none would give it then " " why because he have an understanding with the merchant he ’ buy they off I ’ve have to do with all of they I know they they ’re not merchant you know they ’re speculator he would not look at a bargain that give he ten fifteen per cent profit but hold back to buy a rouble ’s worth for twenty kopeck " " well enough of it you ’re out of temper " " not the least " say levin gloomily as they drive up to the house at the step there stand a trap tightly cover with iron and leather with a sleek horse tightly harness with broad collarstrap in the trap sit the chubby tightly belt clerk who serve ryabinin as coachman ryabinin himself be already in the house and meet the friend in the hall ryabinin be a tall thinnish middleaged man with mustache and a project cleanshaven chin and prominent muddylooking eye he be dress in a longskirted blue coat with button below the waist at the back and wear high boot wrinkled over the ankle and straight over the calf with big galosh draw over they he rub his face with his handkerchief and wrap round he his coat which sit extremely well as it be he greet they with a smile hold out his hand to stepan arkadyevitch as though he want to catch something " so here you be " say stepan arkadyevitch give he his hand " that ’ capital " " I do not venture to disregard your excellency ’s command though the road be extremely bad I positively walk the whole way but I be here at my time konstantin dmitrievitch my respect " he turn to levin try to seize his hand too but levin scowl make as though he do not notice his hand and take out the snipe " your honor have be divert yourselves with the chase what kind of bird may it be pray " add ryabinin look contemptuously at the snipe " a great delicacy I suppose " and he shake his head disapprovingly as though he have grave doubt whether this game be worth the candle " would you like to go into my study " levin say in french to stepan arkadyevitch scowl morosely " go into my study you can talk there " " quite so where you please " say ryabinin with contemptuous dignity as though wish to make it feel that other might be in difficulty as to how to behave but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything on enter the study ryabinin look about as his habit be as though seek the holy picture but when he have find it he do not cross himself he scan the bookcase and bookshelf and with the same dubious air with which he have regard the snipe he smile contemptuously and shake his head disapprovingly as though by no means willing to allow that this game be worth the candle " well have you bring the money " ask oblonsky " sit down " " oh do not trouble about the money I ’ve come to see you to talk it over " " what be there to talk over but do sit down " " I do not mind if I do " say ryabinin sit down and lean his elbow on the back of his chair in a position of the intense discomfort to himself " you must knock it down a bit prince it would be too bad the money be ready conclusively to the last farthing as to pay the money down there ’ll be no hitch there " levin who have meanwhile be put his gun away in the cupboard be just go out of the door but catch the merchant ’s word he stop " why you ’ve get the forest for nothing as it be " he say " he come to I too late or I ’d have fix the price for he " ryabinin get up and in silence with a smile he look levin down and up " very close about money be konstantin dmitrievitch " he say with a smile turn to stepan arkadyevitch " there ’ positively no dealing with he I be bargain for some wheat of he and a pretty price I offer too " " why should I give you my good for nothing I do not pick it up on the ground nor steal it either " " mercy on we nowadays there ’ no chance at all of steal with the open court and everything do in style nowadays there ’ no question of steal we be just talk thing over like gentleman his excellency ’ ask too much for the forest I can not make both end meet over it I must ask for a little concession " " but be the thing settle between you or not if it ’ settle it ’ useless haggle but if it ’ not " say levin " I ’ll buy the forest " the smile vanish at once from ryabinin ’s face a hawklike greedy cruel expression be leave upon it with rapid bony finger he unbutton his coat reveal a shirt bronze waistcoat button and a watch chain and quickly pull out a fat old pocketbook " here you be the forest be mine " he say cross himself quickly and hold out his hand " take the money it ’ my forest that ’ ryabinin ’s way of do business he do not haggle over every halfpenny " he add scowl and wave the pocketbook " I would not be in a hurry if I be you " say levin " come really " say oblonsky in surprise " I ’ve give my word you know " levin go out of the room slam the door ryabinin look towards the door and shake his head with a smile " it ’ all youthfulness — positively nothing but boyishness why I ’m buy it upon my honor simply believe I for the glory of it that ryabinin and no one else should have buy the copse of oblonsky and as to the profit why I must make what god give in god ’s name if you would kindly sign the titledeed " within an hour the merchant stroke his big overcoat neatly down and hook up his jacket with the agreement in his pocket seat himself in his tightly cover trap and drive homewards " ugh these gentlefolk " he say to the clerk " they — they’re a nice lot " " that ’ so " respond the clerk hand he the rein and button the leather apron " but I can congratulate you on the purchase mihail ignatitch " " well well " stepan arkadyevitch go upstairs with his pocket bulge with note which the merchant have pay he for three month in advance the business of the forest be over the money in his pocket their shooting have be excellent and stepan arkadyevitch be in the happy frame of mind and so he feel specially anxious to dissipate the illhumor that have come upon levin he want to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it have be begin levin certainly be out of humor and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor he could not control his mood the intoxication of the news that kitty be not married have gradually begin to work upon he kitty be not married but ill and ill from love for a man who have slight she this slight as it be rebound upon he vronsky have slight she and she have slight he levin consequently vronsky have the right to despise levin and therefore he be his enemy but all this levin do not think out he vaguely feel that there be something in it insulting to he and he be not angry now at what have disturb he but he fall foul of everything that present itself the stupid sale of the forest the fraud practice upon oblonsky and conclude in his house exasperate he " well finish " he say meet stepan arkadyevitch upstairs " would you like supper " " well I would not say no to it what an appetite I get in the country wonderful why do not you offer ryabinin something " " oh damn he " " still how you do treat he " say oblonsky " you do not even shake hand with he why not shake hand with he " " because I do not shake hand with a waiter and a

enough about it " he say " when do anybody ever sell anything without be tell immediately after the sale ' it be worth much more ' but when one want to sell no one will give anything no I see you ’ve a grudge against that unlucky ryabinin " " maybe I have and do you know why you ’ll say again that I ’m a reactionist or some other terrible word but all the same it do annoy and anger I to see on all side the impoverishing of the nobility to which I belong and in spite of the amalgamation of class I ’m glad to belong and their impoverishment be not due to extravagance — that would be nothing live in good style — that ’ the proper thing for nobleman it ’ only the noble who know how to do it now the peasant about we buy land and I do not mind that the gentleman do nothing while the peasant work and supplant the idle man that ’ as it ought to be and I ’m very glad for the peasant but I do mind see the process of impoverishment from a sort of — I do not know what to call it — innocence here a polish speculator buy for half its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who live in nice and there a merchant will get three acre of land worth ten rouble as security for the loan of one rouble here for no kind of reason you ’ve make that rascal a present of thirty thousand rouble " " well what should I have do count every tree " " of course they must be count you do not count they but ryabinin do ryabinin ’s child will have mean of livelihood and education while yours maybe will not " " well you must excuse I but there ’ something mean in this counting we have our business and they have theirs and they must make their profit anyway the thing ’ do and there ’ an end of it and here come some poach egg my favorite dish and agafea mihalovna will give we that marvelous

anyway " say agafea mihalovna " but konstantin dmitrievitch give he what you will — a crust of bread — he’ll eat it and walk away " though levin try to control himself he be gloomy and silent he want to put one question to stepan arkadyevitch but he could not bring himself to the point and could not find the word or the moment in which to put it stepan arkadyevitch have go down to his room undress again wash and attire in a nightshirt with goffered frill he have get into bed but levin still linger in his room talk of various trifling matter and not dare to ask what he want to know " how wonderfully they make this soap " he say gaze at a piece of soap he be handle which agafea mihalovna have put ready for the visitor but oblonsky have not use " only look why it ’ a work of art " " yes

petersburg he leave soon after you do and he ’ not once be in moscow since and do you know kostya I ’ll tell you the truth " he go on lean his elbow on the table and prop on his hand his handsome ruddy face in which his moist goodnatured sleepy eye shine like star " it ’ your own fault you take fright at the sight of your rival but as I tell you at the time I could not say which have the well chance why do not you fight it out I tell you at the time that " he yawn inwardly without open his mouth " do he know or do not he that I do make an offer " levin wonder gaze at he " yes there ’ something humbugging diplomatic in his face " and feel he be blush he look stepan arkadyevitch straight in the face without speak " if there be anything on her side at the time it be nothing but a superficial attraction " pursue oblonsky " his be such a perfect aristocrat do not you know and his future position in society have an influence not with she but with her mother " levin scowl the humiliation of his rejection sting he to the heart as though it be a fresh wound he have only just receive but he be at home and the wall of home be a support " stay stay " he begin interrupt oblonsky " you talk of his be an aristocrat but allow I to ask what it consist in that aristocracy of vronsky or of anybody else beside which I can be look down upon you consider vronsky an aristocrat but I do not a man whose father crawl up from nothing at all by intrigue and whose mother — god know whom she be not mix up with no excuse I but I consider myself aristocratic and people like I who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generation of their family of the high degree of breeding talent and intellect of course that ’ another matter and have never curry favor with anyone never depend on anyone for anything like my father and my grandfather and I know many such you think it mean of I to count the tree in my forest while you make ryabinin a present of thirty thousand but you get rent from your land and I do not know what while I do n’t and so I prize what ’ come to I from my ancestor or be win by hard work we be aristocrat and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful of this world and who can be buy for twopence halfpenny " " well but whom be you attack I agree with you " say stepan arkadyevitch sincerely and genially though he be aware that in the class of those who could be buy for twopence halfpenny levin be reckon he too levin ’s warmth give he genuine pleasure " whom be you attack though a good deal be not true that you say about vronsky but I will not talk about that I tell you straight out if I be you I should go back with I to moscow and " " no I do not know whether you know it or not but I do not care and I tell you — I do make an offer and be reject and katerina alexandrovna be nothing now to I but a painful and humiliating reminiscence " " what ever for what nonsense " " but we will not talk about it please forgive I if I ’ve be nasty " say levin now that he have open his heart he become as he have be in the morning " you ’re not angry with I stiva please do not be angry " he say and smile he take his hand " of course not not a bit and no reason to be I ’m glad we ’ve speak openly and do you know standshooting in the morning be unusually good — why not go I could not sleep the night anyway but I might go straight from shooting to the station " " capital " although all vronsky ’s inner life be absorb in his passion his external life unalterably and inevitably follow along the old accustomed line of his social and

englishman in high boot and a short jacket cleanshaven except for a tuft below his chin come to meet he walk with the uncouth gait of jockey turn his elbow out and sway from side to side " well how ’ froufrou " vronsky ask in english " all right sir " the englishman ’s voice respond somewhere in the inside of his throat " well not go in " he add touch his hat " I ’ve put a muzzle on she and the mare ’ fidgety well not go in it ’ll excite the mare " " no I ’m go in I want to look at she " " come along then " say the englishman frown and speak with his mouth shut and with swinge elbow he go on in front with his disjointed gait they go into the little yard in front of the shed a stable boy spruce and smart in his holiday attire meet they with a broom in his hand and follow they in the shed there be five horse in their separate stall and vronsky know that his chief rival gladiator a very tall chestnut horse have be bring there and must be stand among they even more than his mare vronsky long to see gladiator whom he have never see but he know that by the etiquette of the race course it be not merely impossible for he to see the horse but improper even to ask question about he just as he be pass along the passage the boy open the door into the second horsebox on the left and vronsky catch a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white leg he know that this be gladiator but with the feeling of a man turn away from the sight of another man ’s open letter he turn round and go into froufrou ’s stall " the horse be here belong to mak mak I never can say the name " say the englishman over his shoulder point his big finger and dirty nail towards gladiator ’s stall " mahotin yes he ’ my most serious rival " say vronsky " if you be ride he " say the englishman " I ’d bet on you " " froufrou ’ more nervous he ’ strong " say vronsky smile at the compliment to his riding " in a steeplechase it all depend on riding and on pluck " say the englishman of pluck — that is energy and courage — vronsky do not merely feel that he have enough what be of far more importance he be firmly convince that no one in the world could have more of this " pluck " than he have " do not you think I want more thinning down " " oh no " answer the englishman " please do not speak loud the mare ’ fidgety " he add nod towards the horsebox before which they be stand and from which come the sound of restless stamping in the straw he open the door and vronsky go into the horsebox dimly light by one little window in the horsebox stand a dark bay mare with a muzzle on pick at the fresh straw with her hoof look round he in the twilight of the horsebox vronsky unconsciously take in once more in a comprehensive glance all the point of his favorite mare froufrou be a beast of medium size not altogether free from reproach from a breeder ’s point of view she be smallboned all over though her chest be extremely prominent in front it be narrow her hindquarter be a little droop and in her foreleg and still more in her hindleg there be a noticeable curvature the muscle of both hind and foreleg be not very thick but across her shoulder the mare be exceptionally broad a peculiarity specially striking now that she be lean from training the bone of her leg below the knee look no thick than a finger from in front but be extraordinarily thick see from the side she look altogether except across the shoulder as it be pinch in at the side and press out in depth but she have in the high degree the quality that make all defect forget that quality be blood the blood that tell as the english expression have it the muscle stand up sharply under the network of sinew cover with the delicate mobile skin soft as satin and they be hard as bone her cleancut head with prominent bright spirited eye broaden out at the open nostril that show the red blood in the cartilage within about all her figure and especially her head there be a certain expression of energy and at the same time of softness she be one of those creature which seem only not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth do not allow they to to vronsky at any rate it seem that she understand all he feel at that moment look at she directly vronsky go towards she she draw in a deep breath and turn back her prominent eye till the white look bloodshot she start at the approach figure from the opposite side shake her muzzle and shift lightly from one leg to the other " there you see how fidgety she be " say the englishman " there darling there " say vronsky go up to the mare and speak soothingly to she but the near he come the more excited she grow only when he stand by her head she be suddenly quiet while the muscle quiver under her soft delicate coat vronsky pat her strong neck straighten over her sharp wither a stray lock of her mane that have fall on the other side and move his face near her dilated nostril transparent as a bat ’s wing she draw a loud breath and snort out through her tense nostril start prick up her sharp ear and put out her strong black lip towards vronsky as though she would nip hold of his sleeve but remember the muzzle she shake it and again begin restlessly stamp one after the other her shapely leg " quiet darling quiet " he say pat she again over her hindquarter and with a glad sense that his mare be in the good possible condition he go out of the horsebox the mare ’s excitement have infect vronsky he feel that his heart be throb and that he too like the mare long to move to bite it be both dreadful and delicious " well I rely on you then " he say to the englishman " halfpast six on the ground " " all right " say the englishman " oh where be you go my lord " he ask suddenly use the title " my lord " which he have scarcely ever use before vronsky in amazement raise his head and stare as he know how to stare not into the englishman ’s eye but at his forehead astound at the impertinence of his question but realize that in ask this the englishman have be look at he not as an employer but as a jockey he answer " I ’ve get to go to bryansky ’s I shall be home within an hour " " how often I ’m ask that question today " he say to himself and he blush a thing which rarely happen to he the englishman look gravely at he and as though he too know where vronsky be go he add " the great thing ’ to keep quiet before a race " say he " do not get out of temper or upset about anything " " all right " answer vronsky smile and jump into his carriage he tell the man to drive to peterhof before he have drive many pace away the dark cloud that have be threaten rain all day break and there be a heavy downpour of rain " what a pity " think vronsky put up the roof of the carriage " it be muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp " as he sit in solitude in the closed carriage he take out his mother ’s letter and his brother ’s note and read they through yes it be the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone think fit to interfere in the affair of his heart this interference arouse in he a feeling of angry hatred — a feeling he have rarely know before " what business be it of theirs why do everybody feel call upon to concern himself about I and why do they worry I so just because they see that this be something they can not understand if it be a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have leave I alone they feel that this be something different that this be not a mere pastime that this woman be dear to I than life and this be incomprehensible and that ’ why it annoy they whatever our destiny be or may be we have make it ourselves and we do not complain of it " he say in the word we link himself with anna " no they must needs teach we how to live they have not an idea of what happiness be they do not know that without our love for we there be neither happiness nor unhappiness — no life at all " he think he be angry with all of they for their interference just because he feel in his soul that you all these people be right he feel that the love that bind he to anna be not a momentary impulse which would pass as worldly intrigue do pass leave no other trace in the life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memory he feel all the torture of his own and her position all the difficulty there be for they conspicuous as they be in the eye of all the world in conceal their love in lying and deceive and in lie deceive feign and continually think of other when the passion that unite they be so intense that they be both oblivious of everything else but their love he vividly recall all the constantly recur instance of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit which be so against his natural bent he recall particularly vividly the shame he have more than once detect in she at this necessity for lying and deceit and he experience the strange feeling that have sometimes come upon he since his secret love for anna this be a feeling of loathing for something — whether for alexey alexandrovitch or for himself or for the whole world he could not have say but he always drive away this strange feeling now too he shake it off and continue the thread of his thought " yes she be unhappy before but proud and at peace and now she can not be at peace and feel secure in her dignity though she do not show it yes we must put an end to it " he decide and for the first time the idea clearly present itself that it be essential to put an end to this false position and the soon the well " throw up everything she and I and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love " he say to himself the rain do not last long and by the time vronsky arrive his shafthorse trot at full speed and drag the tracehorse gallop through the mud with their rein hang loose the sun have peep out again the roof of the summer villa and the old limetree in the garden on both side of the principal street sparkle with wet brilliance and from the twig come a pleasant drip and from the roof rush stream of water he think no more of the shower spoil the race course but be rejoice now that — thank to the rain — he would be sure to find she at home and alone as he know that alexey alexandrovitch who have lately return from a foreign watering place have not move from petersburg hope to find she alone vronsky alighted as he always do to avoid attract attention before cross the bridge and walk to the house he do not go up the step to the street door but go into the court " have your master come " he ask a gardener " no sir the mistress be at home but will you please go to the front door there be servant there " the gardener answer " they ’ll open the door " " no I ’ll go in from the garden " and feel satisfied that she be alone and want to take she by surprise since he have not promise to be there today and she would certainly not expect he to come before the race he walk hold his sword and step cautiously over the sandy path border with flower to the terrace that look out upon the garden vronsky forget now all that he have think on the way of the hardship and difficulty of their position he think of nothing but that he would see she directly not in imagination but live all of she as she be in reality he be just go in step on his whole foot so as not to creak up the worn step of the terrace when he suddenly remember what he always forget and what cause the most torturing side of his relation with she her son with his questioning — hostile as he fancy — eye this boy be more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom when he be present both vronsky and anna do not merely avoid speak of anything that they could not have repeat before everyone they do not even allow themselves to refer by hint to anything the boy do not understand they have make no agreement about this it have settle itself they would have feel it wound themselves to deceive the child in his presence they talk like acquaintance but in spite of this caution vronsky often see the child ’s intent bewildered glance fix upon he and a strange shyness uncertainty at one time friendliness at another coldness and reserve in the boy ’s manner to he as though the child feel that between this man and his mother there exist some important bond the significance of which he could not understand as a fact the boy do feel that he could not understand this relation and he try painfully and be not able to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man with a child ’s keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling he see distinctly that his father his governess his nurse — all do not merely dislike vronsky but look on he with horror and aversion though they never say anything about he while his mother look on he as her great friend " what do it mean who be he how ought I to love he if I do not know it ’ my fault either I ’m stupid or a naughty boy " think the child and this be what cause his dubious inquire sometimes hostile expression and the shyness and uncertainty which vronsky find so irksome this child ’s presence always and infallibly call up in vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he have experience of late this child ’s presence call up both in vronsky and in anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who see by the compass that the direction in which he be swiftly move be far from the right one but that to arrest his motion be not in his power that every instant be carry he far and far away and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction be the same as admit his certain ruin this child with his innocent outlook upon life be the compass that show they the point to which they have depart from what they know but do not want to know this time seryozha be not at home and she be completely alone she be sit on the terrace wait for the return of her son who have go out for his walk and be catch in the rain she have send a manservant and a maid out to look for he dress in a white gown deeply embroider she be sit in a corner of the terrace behind some flower and do not hear he bend her curly black head she press her forehead against a cool watering pot that stand on the parapet and both her lovely hand with the ring he know so well clasp the pot the beauty of her whole figure her head her neck her hand strike vronsky every time as something new and unexpected he stand still gaze at she in ecstasy but directly he would have make a step to come near to she she be aware of his presence push away the watering pot and turn her flushed face towards he " what ’ the matter you be ill " he say to she in french go up to she he would have run to she but remember that there might be spectator he look round towards the balcony door and redden a little as he always redden feeling that he have to be afraid and be on his guard " no I ’m quite well " she say get up and press his outstretched hand tightly " I do not expect   thee " " mercy what cold hand " he say " you startle I " she say " I ’m alone and expect seryozha he ’ out for a walk they ’ll come in from this side " but in spite of her effort to be calm her lip be quiver " forgive I for come but I could not pass the day without see you " he go on speak french as he always do to avoid use the stiff russian plural form so impossibly frigid between they and the dangerously intimate singular " forgive you I ’m so glad " " but you ’re ill or worried " he go on not let go her hand and bend over she " what be you think of " " always the same thing " she say with a smile she speak the truth if ever at any moment she have be ask what she be think of she could have answer truly of the same thing of her happiness and her unhappiness she be think just when he come upon she of this why be it she wonder that to other to betsy she know of her secret connection with tushkevitch it be all easy while to she it be such torture today this thought gain special poignancy from certain other consideration she ask he about the race he answer her question and see that she be agitated try to calm she he begin tell she in the simple tone the detail of his preparation for the race " tell he or not tell he " she think look into his quiet affectionate eye " he be so happy so absorbed in his race that he will not understand as he ought he will not understand all the gravity of this fact to we " " but you have not tell I what you be think of when I come in " he say interrupt his narrative " please tell I " she do not answer and bend her head a little she look inquiringly at he from under her brow her eye shine under their long lash her hand shake as it play with a leaf she have pick he see it and his face express that utter subjection that slavish devotion which have do so much to win she " I see something have happen do you suppose I can be at peace know you have a trouble I be not share tell I for god ’s sake " he repeat imploringly " yes I shall not be able to forgive he if he do not realize all the gravity of it well not tell why put he to the proof " she think still stare at he in the same way and feel the hand that hold the leaf be tremble more and more " for god ’s sake " he repeat take her hand " shall I tell you " " yes yes yes " " I ’m with child " she say softly and deliberately the leaf in her hand shake more violently but she do not take her eye off he watch how he would take it he turn white would have say something but stop he drop her hand and his head sink on his breast " yes he realize all the gravity of it " she think and gratefully she press his hand but she be mistaken in think he realize the gravity of the fact as she a woman realize it on hear it he feel come upon he with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone but at the same time he feel that the turningpoint he have be long for have come now that it be impossible to go on conceal thing from her husband and it be inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position but besides that her emotion physically affect he in the same way he look at she with a look of submissive tenderness kiss her hand get up and in silence pace up and down the terrace " yes " he say go up to she resolutely " neither you nor I have look on our relation as a pass amusement and now our fate be seal it be absolutely necessary to put an end”—he look round as he spoke—“to the deception in which we be live " " put an end how put an end alexey " she say softly she be calm now and her face light up with a tender smile " leave your husband and make our life one " " it be one as it be " she answer scarcely audibly " yes but altogether altogether " " but how alexey tell I how " she say in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own position " be there any way out of such a position be I not the wife of my husband " " there be a way out of every position we must take our line " he say " anything ’ well than the position in which you ’re live of course I see how you torture yourself over everything — the world and your son and your husband " " oh not over my husband " she say with a quiet smile " I do not know he I do not think of he he do not exist " " you ’re not speak sincerely I know you you worry about he too " " oh he do not even know " she say and suddenly a hot flush come over her face her cheek her brow her neck crimson and tear of shame come into her eye " but we will not talk of he " vronsky have several time already though not so resolutely as now try to bring she to consider their position and every time he have be confront by the same superficiality and triviality with which she meet his appeal now it be as though there be something in this which she could not or would not face as though directly she begin to speak of this she the real anna retreat somehow into herself and another strange and unaccountable woman come out whom he do not love and whom he fear and who be in opposition to he but today he be resolved to have it out " whether he know or not " say vronsky in his usual quiet and resolute tone " that ’ nothing to do with we we can not   you can not stay like this especially now " " what ’ to be do accord to you " she ask with the same frivolous irony she who have so fear he would take her condition too lightly be now vex with he for deduce from it the necessity of take some step " tell he everything and leave he " " very well let we suppose I do that " she say " do you know what the result of that would be I can tell you it all beforehand " and a wicked light gleam in her eye that have be so soft a minute before " ' eh you love another man and have enter into criminal intrigue with he ' " mimic her husband she throw an emphasis on the word " criminal " as alexey alexandrovitch do " ' I warn you of the result in the religious the civil and the domestic relation you have not listen to I now I can not let you disgrace my name — ' " " and my son " she have mean to say but about her son she could not jest—“‘disgrace my name and’—and more in the same style " she add " in general term he ’ll say in his official manner and with all distinctness and precision that he can not let I go but will take all measure in his power to prevent scandal and he will calmly and punctually act in accordance with his word that ’ what will happen he ’ not a man but a machine and a spiteful machine when he ’ angry " she add recall alexey alexandrovitch as she speak with all the peculiarity of his figure and manner of speak and reckon against he every defect she could find in he soften nothing for the great wrong she herself be do he " but anna " say vronsky in a soft and persuasive voice try to soothe she " we absolutely must anyway tell he and then be guide by the line he take " " what run away " " and why not run away I do not see how we can keep on like this and not for my sake — I see that you suffer " " yes run away and become your mistress " she say angrily " anna " he say with reproachful tenderness " yes " she go on " become your mistress and complete the ruin of " again she would have say " my son " but she could not utter that word vronsky could not understand how she with her strong and truthful nature could endure this state of deceit and not long to get out of it but he do not suspect that the chief cause of it be the word — son which she could not bring herself to pronounce when she think of her son and his future attitude to his mother who have abandon his father she feel such terror at what she have do that she could not face it but like a woman could only try to comfort herself with lie assurance that everything would remain as it always have be and that it be possible to forget the fearful question of how it would be with her son " I beg you I entreat you " she say suddenly take his hand and speak in quite a different tone sincere and tender " never speak to I of that " " but anna " " never leave it to I I know all the baseness all the horror of my position but it ’ not so easy to arrange as you think and leave it to I and do what I say never speak to I of it do you promise I no no promise " " I promise everything but I can not be at peace especially after what you have tell I I can not be at peace when you can not be at peace " " I " she repeat " yes I be worried sometimes but that will pass if you will never talk about this when you talk about it — it ’ only then it worry I " " I do not understand " he say " I know " she interrupt he " how hard it be for your truthful nature to lie and I grieve for you I often think that you have ruin your whole life for I " " I be just think the very same thing " he say " how could you sacrifice everything for my sake I can not forgive myself that you ’re unhappy " " I unhappy " she say come close to he and look at he with an ecstatic smile of love " I be like a hungry man who have be give food he may be cold and dressed in rag and ashamed but he be not unhappy I unhappy no this be my unhappiness " she could hear the sound of her son ’s voice come towards they and glance swiftly round the terrace she get up impulsively her eye glow with the fire he know so well with a rapid movement she raise her lovely hand cover with ring take his head look a long look into his face and put up her face with smile part lip swiftly kiss his mouth and both eye and push he away she would have go but he hold she back " when " he murmur in a whisper gaze in ecstasy at she " tonight at one o’clock " she whisper and with a heavy sigh she walk with her light swift step to meet her son seryozha have be catch by the rain in the big garden and he and his nurse have take shelter in an arbor " well au revoir " she say to vronsky " I must soon be get ready for the race betsy promise to fetch I " vronsky look at his watch go away hurriedly when vronsky look at his watch on the karenins ' balcony he be so greatly agitated and lose in his thought that he see the figure on the watch ’s face but could not take in what time it be he come out on to the highroad and walk pick his way carefully through the mud to his carriage he be so completely absorbed in his feeling for anna that he do not even think what o’clock it be and whether he have time to go to bryansky ’s he have leave he as often happen only the external faculty of memory that point out each step one have to take one after the other he go up to his coachman who be doze on the box in the shadow already lengthen of a thick limetree he admire the shift cloud of midge circle over the hot horse and wake the coachman he jump into the carriage and tell he to drive to bryansky ’s it be only after drive nearly five mile that he have sufficiently recover himself to look at his watch and realize that it be halfpast five and he be late there be several race fix for that day the mounted guard ' race then the officer ' mileandahalf race then the threemile race and then the race for which he be enter he could still be in time for his race but if he go to bryansky ’s he could only just be in time and he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their place that would be a pity but he have promise bryansky to come and so he decide to drive on tell the coachman not to spare the horse he reach bryansky ’s spend five minute there and gallop back this rapid drive calm he all that be painful in his relation with anna all the feeling of indefiniteness leave by their conversation have slip out of his mind he be think now with pleasure and excitement of the race of his be anyhow in time and now and then the thought of the blissful interview await he that night flash across his imagination like a flame light the excitement of the approach race gain upon he as he drive far and far into the atmosphere of the race overtake carriage drive up from the summer villa or out of petersburg at his quarter no one be leave at home all be at the race and his valet be look out for he at the gate while he be change his clothe his valet tell he that the second race have begin already that a lot of gentleman have be to ask for he and a boy have twice run up from the stable dress without hurry he never hurry himself and never lose his selfpossession vronsky drive to the shed from the shed he could see a perfect sea of carriage and people on foot soldier surround the race course and pavilion swarm with people the second race be apparently go on for just as he go into the shed he hear a bell ring go towards the stable he meet the whitelegged chestnut mahotin ’s gladiator be lead to the racecourse in a blue forage horsecloth with what look like huge ear edge with blue " where ’ cord " he ask the stableboy " in the stable put on the saddle " in the open horsebox stand froufrou saddle ready they be just go to lead she out " I ’m not too late " " all right all right " say the englishman " do not upset yourself " vronsky once more take in in one glance the exquisite line of his favorite mare who be quiver all over and with an effort he tear himself from the sight of she and go out of the stable he go towards the pavilion at the most favorable moment for escape attention the mileandahalf race be just finish and all eye be fix on the horseguard in front and the light hussar behind urge their horse on with a last effort close to the winning post from the center and outside of the ring all be crowd to the winning post and a group of soldier and officer of the horseguard be shout loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade vronsky move into the middle of the crowd unnoticed almost at the very moment when the bell ring at the finish of the race and the tall mudspattered horseguard who come in first bend over the saddle let go the rein of his pant gray horse that look dark with sweat the horse stiffen out its leg with an effort stop its rapid course and the officer of the horseguard look round he like a man wake up from a heavy sleep and just manage to smile a crowd of friend and outsider press round he vronsky intentionally avoid that select crowd of the upper world which be move and talk with discreet freedom before the pavilion he know that madame karenina be there and betsy and his brother ’s wife and he purposely do not go near they for fear of something distract his attention but he be continually meet and stop by acquaintance who tell he about the previous race and keep ask he why he be so late at the time when the racer have to go to the pavilion to receive the prize and all attention be direct to that point vronsky ’s eld brother alexander a colonel with heavy fringed epaulet come up to he he be not tall though as broadly built as alexey and handsome and rosy than he he have a red nose and an open drunkenlooking face " do you get my note " he say " there ’ never any finding you " alexander vronsky in spite of the dissolute life and in especial the drunken habit for which he be notorious be quite one of the court circle now as he talk to his brother of a matter bind to be exceedingly disagreeable to he know that the eye of many people might be fix upon he he keep a smile countenance as though he be jest with his brother about something of little moment " I get it and I really can not make out what you be worry yourself about " say alexey " I ’m worry myself because the remark have just be make to I that

and glossy " I come up yesterday and I ’m delighted that I shall see your triumph when shall we meet " " come tomorrow to the messroom " say vronsky and squeeze he by the sleeve of his coat with apology he move away to the center of the race course where the horse be be lead for the great steeplechase the horse who have run in the last race be be lead home steam and exhausted by the stableboy and one after another the fresh horse for the come race make their appearance for the most part english racer wear horsecloth and look with their drawnup belly like strange huge bird on the right be

another to the spectator it seem as though they have all start simultaneously but to the racer there be second of difference that have great value to they froufrou excited and overnervous have lose the first moment and several horse have start before she but before reach the stream vronsky who be hold in the mare with all his force as she tug at the bridle easily overtake three and there be leave in front of he mahotin ’s chestnut gladiator whose hindquarter be move lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of vronsky and in front of all the dainty mare diana bear kuzovlev more dead than alive for the first instant vronsky be not master either of himself or his mare up to the first obstacle the stream he could not guide the motion of his mare gladiator and diana come up to it together and almost at the same instant simultaneously they rise above the stream and fly across to the other side froufrou dart after they as if fly but at the very moment when vronsky feel himself in the air he suddenly see almost under his mare ’s hoof kuzovlev who be flounder with diana on the further side of the stream kuzovlev have let go the rein as he take the leap and the mare have send he fly over her head those detail vronsky learn later at the moment all he see be that just under he where froufrou must alight diana ’s leg or head might be in the way but froufrou draw up her leg and back in the very act of leap like a fall cat and clear the other mare alight beyond she " o the darling " think vronsky after cross the stream vronsky have complete control of his mare and begin hold she in intend to cross the great barrier behind mahotin and to try to overtake he in the clear ground of about five hundred yard that follow it the great barrier stand just in front of the imperial pavilion the tsar and the whole court and crowd of people be all gaze at they — at he and mahotin a length ahead of he as they draw near the " devil " as the solid barrier be call vronsky be aware of those eye fasten upon he from all side but he see nothing except the ear and neck of his own mare the ground race to meet he and the back and white leg of gladiator beat time swiftly before he and keep always the same distance ahead gladiator rise with no sound of knock against anything with a wave of his short tail he disappear from vronsky ’s sight " bravo " cry a voice at the same instant under vronsky ’s eye right before he flash the paling of the barrier without the slight change in her action his mare fly over it the paling vanish and he hear only a crash behind he the mare excite by gladiator ’s keeping ahead have rise too soon before the barrier and graze it with her hind hoof but her pace never change and vronsky feel a spatter of mud in his face realize that he be once more the same distance from gladiator once more he perceive in front of he the same back and short tail and again the same swiftly move white leg that get no far away at the very moment when vronsky think that now be the time to overtake mahotin froufrou herself understand his thought without any incitement on his part gain ground considerably and begin get alongside of mahotin on the most favorable side close to the inner cord mahotin would not let she pass that side vronsky have hardly form the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side when froufrou shift her pace and begin overtake he on the other side froufrou ’s shoulder begin by now to be dark with sweat be even with gladiator ’s back for a few length they move evenly but before the obstacle they be approach vronsky begin work at the rein anxious to avoid have to take the outer circle and swiftly pass mahotin just upon the declivity he catch a glimpse of his mudstained face as he flash by he even fancy that he smile vronsky pass mahotin but he be immediately aware of he close upon he and he never cease hear the eventhudding hoof and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of gladiator the next two obstacle the water course and the barrier be easily cross but vronsky begin to hear the snorting and thud of gladiator close upon he he urge on his mare and to his delight feel that she easily quicken her pace and the thud of gladiator ’s hoof be again hear at the same distance away vronsky be at the head of the race just as he want to be and as cord have advise and now he feel sure of be the winner his excitement his delight and his tenderness for froufrou grow keen and keen he long to look round again but he do not dare do this and try to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in she as he feel that gladiator still keep there remain only one obstacle the most difficult if he could cross it ahead of the other he would come in first he be fly towards the irish barricade froufrou and he both together see the barricade in the distance and both the man and the mare have a moment ’s hesitation he see the uncertainty in the mare ’s ear and lift the whip but at the same time feel that his fear be groundless the mare know what be want she quicken her pace and rise smoothly just as he have fancy she would and as she leave the ground give herself up to the force of her rush which carry she far beyond the ditch and with the same rhythm without effort with the same leg forward froufrou fall back into her pace again " bravo vronsky " he hear shout from a knot of man — he know they be his friend in the regiment — who be stand at the obstacle he could not fail to recognize yashvin ’s voice though he do not see he " o my sweet " he say inwardly to froufrou as he listen for what be happen behind " he ’ clear it " he think catch the thud of gladiator ’s hoof behind he there remain only the last ditch fill with water and five foot wide vronsky do not even look at it but anxious to get in a long way first begin saw away at the rein lift the mare ’s head and let it go in time with her pace he feel that the mare be at her very last reserve of strength not her neck and shoulder merely be wet but the sweat be stand in drop on her mane her head her sharp ear and her breath come in short sharp gasp but he know that she have strength leave more than enough for the remain five hundred yard it be only from feel himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that vronsky know how greatly the mare have quicken her pace she fly over the ditch as though not notice it she fly over it like a bird but at the same instant vronsky to his horror feel that he have fail to keep up with the mare ’s pace that he have he do not know how make a fearful unpardonable mistake in recover his seat in the saddle all at once his position have shift and he know that something awful have happen he could not yet make out what have happen when the white leg of a chestnut horse flash by close to he and mahotin pass at a swift gallop vronsky be touch the ground with one foot and his mare be sink on that foot he just have time to free his leg when she fall on one side gasp painfully and make vain effort to rise with her delicate soak neck she flutter on the ground at his foot like a shot bird the clumsy movement make by vronsky have break her back but that he only know much later at that moment he know only that mahotin have fly swiftly by while he stand stagger alone on the muddy motionless ground and froufrou lie gasp before he bend her head back and gaze at he with her exquisite eye still unable to realize what have happen vronsky tug at his mare ’s rein again she struggle all over like a fish and her shoulder set the saddle heave she rise on her front leg but unable to lift her back she quiver all over and again fall on her side with a face hideous with passion his lower jaw tremble and his cheek white vronsky kick she with his heel in the stomach and again fall to tug at the rein she do not stir but thrust her nose into the ground she simply gaze at her master with her speak eye " a — a — a " groan vronsky clutch at his head " ah what have I do " he cry " the race lose and my fault shameful unpardonable and the poor darling ruin mare ah what have I do " a crowd of man a doctor and his assistant the officer of his regiment run up to he to his misery he feel that he be whole and unhurt the mare have break she back and it be decide to shoot she vronsky could not answer question could not speak to anyone he turn and without pick up his cap that have fall off walk away from the race course not know where he be go he feel utterly wretched for the first time in his life he know the bitter sort of misfortune misfortune beyond remedy and cause by his own fault yashvin overtake he with his cap and lead he home and half an hour later vronsky have regain his selfpossession but the memory of that race remain for long in his heart the cruel and bitter memory of his life the external relation of alexey alexandrovitch and his wife have remain unchanged the sole difference lie in the fact that he be more busily occupied than ever as in former year at the beginning of the spring he have go to a foreign wateringplace for the sake of his health derange by the winter ’s work that every year grow heavy and just as always he return in july and at once fall to work as usual with increased energy as usual too his wife have move for the summer to a villa out of town while he remain in petersburg from the date of their conversation after the party at princess tverskaya ’s he have never speak again to anna of his suspicion and his jealousy and that habitual tone of his bantering mimicry be the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife he be a little cold to his wife he simply seem to be slightly displeased with she for that first midnight conversation which she have repel in his attitude to she there be a shade of vexation but nothing more " you would not be open with I " he seem to say mentally address she " so much the bad for you now you may beg as you please but I will not be open with you so much the bad for you " he say mentally like a man who after vainly attempt to extinguish a fire should fly in a rage with his vain effort and say " oh very well then you shall burn for this " this man so subtle and astute in official life do not realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife he do not realize it because it be too terrible to he to realize his actual position and he shut down and lock and seal up in his heart that secret place where lie hide his feeling towards his family that be his wife and son he who have be such a careful father have from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son and adopt to he just the same bantering tone he use with his wife " aha young man " be the greeting with which he meet he alexey alexandrovitch assert and believe that he have never in any previous year have so much official business as that year but he be not aware that he seek work for himself that year that this be one of the mean for keep shut that secret place where lay hide his feeling towards his wife and son and his thought about they which become more terrible the long they lie there if anyone have have the right to ask alexey alexandrovitch what he think of his wife ’s behavior the mild and peaceable alexey alexandrovitch would have make no answer but he would have be greatly anger with any man who should question he on that subject for this reason there positively come into alexey alexandrovitch ’s face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquire after his wife ’s health alexey alexandrovitch do not want to think at all about his wife ’s behavior and he actually succeed in not think about it at all alexey alexandrovitch ’s permanent summer villa be in peterhof and the countess lidia ivanovna use as a rule to spend the summer there close to anna and constantly see she that year countess lidia ivanovna decline to settle in peterhof be not once at anna arkadyevna ’s and in conversation with alexey alexandrovitch hint at the unsuitability of anna ’s close intimacy with betsy and vronsky alexey alexandrovitch sternly cut she short roundly declare his wife to be above suspicion and from that time begin to avoid countess lidia ivanovna he do not want to see and do not see that many people in society cast dubious glance on his wife he do not want to understand and do not understand why his wife have so particularly insist on stay at tsarskoe where betsy be stay and not far from the camp of vronsky ’s regiment he do not allow himself to think about it and he do not think about it but all the same though he never admit it to himself and have no proof not even suspicious evidence in the bottom of his heart he know you all doubt that he be a deceive husband and he be profoundly miserable about it how often during those eight year of happy life with his wife alexey alexandrovitch have look at other man ’s faithless wife and other deceive husband and ask himself " how can people descend to that how be it they do not put an end to such a hideous position " but now when the misfortune have come upon himself he be so far from think of put an end to the position that he would not recognize it at all would not recognize it just because it be too awful too unnatural since his return from abroad alexey alexandrovitch have twice be at their country villa once he dine there another time he spend the evening there with a party of friend but he have not once stay the night there as it have be his habit to do in previous year the day of the race have be a very busy day for alexey alexandrovitch but when mentally sketch out the day in the morning he make up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife immediately after dinner and from there to the race which all the court be to witness and at which he be bind to be present he be go to see his wife because he have determine to see she once a week to keep up appearance and besides on that day as it be the fifteenth he have to give his wife some money for her expense accord to their usual arrangement with his habitual control over his thought though he think all this about his wife he do not let his thought stray far in regard to she that morning be a very full one for alexey alexandrovitch the evening before countess lidia ivanovna have send he a pamphlet by a celebrate traveler in china who be stay in petersburg and with it she enclose a note beg he to see the traveler himself as he be an extremely interesting person from various point of view and likely to be useful alexey alexandrovitch have not have time to read the pamphlet through in the evening and finish it in the morning then people begin arrive with petition and there come the report interview appointment dismissal apportionment of reward pension grant note the workaday round as alexey alexandrovitch call it that always take up so much time then there be private business of his own a visit from the doctor and the steward who manage his property the steward do not take up much time he simply give alexey alexandrovitch the money he need together with a brief statement of the position of his affair which be not altogether satisfactory as it have happen that during that year owe to increase expense more have be pay out than usual and there be a deficit but the doctor a celebrated petersburg doctor who be an intimate acquaintance of alexey alexandrovitch take up a great deal of time alexey alexandrovitch have not expect he that day and be surprised at his visit and still more so when the doctor question he very carefully about his health listen to his breathing and tap at his liver alexey alexandrovitch do not know that his friend lidia ivanovna notice that he be not as well as usual that year have beg the doctor to go and examine he " do this for my sake " the countess lidia ivanovna have say to he " I will do it for the sake of russia countess " reply the doctor " a priceless man " say the countess lidia ivanovna the doctor be extremely dissatisfied with alexey alexandrovitch he find the liver considerably enlarge and the digestive power weaken while the course of mineral water have be quite without effect he prescribe more physical exercise as far as possible and as far as possible less mental strain and above all no worry — in other word just what be as much out of alexey alexandrovitch ’s power as abstain from breathing then he withdraw leave in alexey alexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something be wrong with he and that there be no chance of cure it as he be come away the doctor chance to meet on the staircase an acquaintance of his sludin who be secretary of alexey alexandrovitch ’s department they have be comrade at the university and though they rarely meet they think highly of each other and be excellent friend and so there be no one to whom the doctor would have give his opinion of a patient so freely as to sludin " how glad I be you ’ve be see he " say sludin " he ’ not well and I fancy well what do you think of he " " I ’ll tell you " say the doctor beckon over sludin ’s head to his coachman to bring the carriage round " it ’ just this " say the doctor take a finger of his kid glove in his white hand and pull it " if you do not strain the string and then try to break they you ’ll find it a difficult job but strain a string to its very utmost and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it and with his close assiduity his conscientious devotion to his work he ’ strain to the utmost and there ’ some outside burden weigh on he and not a light one " conclude the doctor raise his eyebrow significantly " will you be at the race " he add as he sink into his seat in the carriage " yes yes to be sure it do waste a lot of time " the doctor respond vaguely to some reply of sludin ’s he have not catch directly after the doctor who have take up so much time come the celebrated traveler and alexey alexandrovitch by mean of the pamphlet he have only just finish read and his previous acquaintance with the subject impress the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the

have to have some conversation after his departure he have to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary and then he still have to drive round to call on a certain great personage on a matter of grave and serious import alexey alexandrovitch only just manage to be back by five o’clock his dinnerhour and after dine with his secretary he invite he to drive with he to his country villa and to the race though he do not acknowledge it to himself alexey alexandrovitch always try nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his interview with his wife anna be upstairs stand before the lookingglass and with annushka ’s assistance pin the last ribbon on her gown when she hear carriage wheel crunch the gravel at the entrance " it ’ too early for betsy " she think and glance out of the window she catch sight of the carriage and the black hat of alexey alexandrovitch and the ear that she know so well stick up each side of it " how unlucky can he be go to stay the night " she wonder and the thought of all that might come of such a chance strike she as so awful and terrible that without dwell on it for a moment she go down to meet he with a bright and radiant face and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in herself that she have come to know of late she abandon herself to that spirit and begin talk hardly know what she be say " ah how nice of you " she say give her husband her hand and greet sludin who be like one of the family with a smile " you ’re stay the night I hope " be the first word the spirit of falsehood prompt she to utter " and now we ’ll go together only it ’ a pity I ’ve promise betsy she ’ come for I " alexey alexandrovitch knit his brow at betsy ’s name " oh I ’m not go to separate the inseparable " he say in

have be do and try to persuade he to take a rest and come out to she all this she say brightly rapidly and with a peculiar brilliance in her eye but alexey alexandrovitch do not now attach any special significance to this tone of hers he hear only her word and give they only the direct sense they bear and he answer simply though jestingly there be nothing remarkable in all this conversation but never after could anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang of shame seryozha come in precede by his governess if alexey alexandrovitch have allow himself to observe he would have notice the timid and bewildered eye with which seryozha glance first at his father and then at his mother but he would not see anything and he do not see it " ah the young man he ’ grow really he ’ get quite a man how be you young man " and he give his hand to the scared child seryozha have be shy of his father before and now ever since alexey alexandrovitch have take to call he young man and since that insoluble question have occur to he whether vronsky be a friend or a foe he avoid his father he look round towards his mother as though seek shelter it be only with his mother that he be at ease meanwhile alexey alexandrovitch be hold his son by the shoulder while he be speak to the governess and seryozha be so miserably uncomfortable that anna see he be on the point of tear anna who have

in high boot a cape and black hat dart out at the entrance " I ’m go goodbye " say anna and kiss her son she go up to alexey alexandrovitch and hold out her hand to he " it be ever so nice of you to come " alexey alexandrovitch kiss her hand " well au revoir then you ’ll come back for some tea that ’ delightful " she say and go out gay and radiant but as soon as she no long see he she be aware of the spot on her hand that his lip have touch and she shudder with repulsion when alexey alexandrovitch reach the racecourse anna be already sit in the pavilion beside betsy in that pavilion where all the high society have gather she catch sight of her husband in the distance two man her husband and her lover be the two center of her existence and unaide by her external sense she be aware of their nearness she be aware of her husband approach a long way off and she could not help follow he in the surge crowd in the midst of which he be move she watch his progress towards the pavilion see he now respond condescendingly to an ingratiating bow now exchange friendly nonchalant greeting with his equal now assiduously try to catch the eye of some great one of this world and take off his big round hat that squeeze the tip of his ear all these way of his she know and all be hateful to she " nothing but ambition nothing but the desire to get on that ’ all there be in his soul " she think " as for these lofty ideal love of culture religion they be only so many tool for get on " from his glance towards the lady ' pavilion he be stare straight at she but do not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin ribbon feather parasol and flower she see that he be look for she but she purposely avoid notice he " alexey alexandrovitch " princess betsy call to he " I ’m sure you do not see your wife here she be " he smile his chilly smile " there ’ so much splendor here that one ’s eye be dazzle " he say and he go into the pavilion he smile to his wife as a man should smile on meet his wife after only just part from she and greet the princess and other acquaintance give to each what be due — that be to say jest with the lady and deal out friendly greeting among the man below near the pavilion be stand an adjutantgeneral of whom alexey alexandrovitch have a high opinion note for his intelligence and culture alexey alexandrovitch enter into conversation with he there be an interval between the race and so nothing hinder conversation the adjutantgeneral express his disapproval of race alexey alexandrovitch reply defend they anna hear his high measured tone not lose one word and every word strike she as false and stab her ear with pain when the threemile steeplechase be begin she bend forward and gaze with fixed eye at vronsky as he go up to his horse and mount and at the same time she hear that loathsome neverceasing voice of her husband she be in an agony of terror for vronsky but a still great agony be the neverceasing as it seem to her stream of her husband ’s shrill voice with its familiar intonation " I ’m a wicked woman a lost woman " she think " but I do not like lie I can not endure falsehood while as for he her husband it ’ the breath of his life — falsehood he know all about it he see it all what do he care if he can talk so calmly if he be to kill I if he be to kill vronsky I might respect he no all he want be falsehood and propriety " anna say to herself not consider exactly what it be she want of her husband and how she would have like to see he behave she do not understand either that alexey alexandrovitch ’s peculiar loquacity that day so exasperating to she be merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness as a child that have be hurt skip about put all his muscle into movement to drown the pain in the same way alexey alexandrovitch need mental exercise to drown the thought of his wife that in her presence and in vronsky ’s and with the continual iteration of his name would force themselves on his attention and it be as natural for he to talk well and cleverly as it be natural for a child to skip about he be say " danger in the race of officer of cavalry man be an essential element in the race if england can point to the most brilliant feat of cavalry in military history it be simply owe to the fact that she have historically develop this force both in beast and in man sport have in my opinion a great value and as be always the case we see nothing but what be most superficial " " it ’ not superficial " say princess tverskaya " one of the officer they say have break two rib " alexey alexandrovitch smile his smile which uncover his tooth but reveal nothing more " we ’ll admit princess that that ’ not superficial " he say " but internal but that ’ not the point " and he turn again to the general with whom he be talk seriously " we must not forget that those who be take part in the race be military man who have choose that career and one must allow that every calling have its disagreeable side it form an integral part of the duty of an officer low sport such as prizefighting or spanish bullfight be a sign of barbarity but specialized trial of skill be a sign of development " " no I sha not come another time it ’ too upsetting " say princess betsy " be not it anna " " it be upsetting but one can not tear oneself away " say another lady " if I ’d be a roman woman I should never have miss a single circus " anna say nothing and keep her operaglass up gaze always at the same spot at that moment a tall general walk through the pavilion break off what he be say alexey alexandrovitch get up hurriedly though with dignity and bow low to the general " you ’re not race " the officer ask chaff he " my race be a hard one " alexey alexandrovitch respond deferentially and though the answer mean nothing the general look as though he have hear a witty remark from a witty man and fully relish la pointe de la sauce " there be two aspect " alexey alexandrovitch resume " those who take part and those who look on and love for such spectacle be an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator I admit but " " princess bets " sound stepan arkadyevitch ’s voice from below address betsy " who ’ your favorite " " anna and I be for kuzovlev " reply betsy " I ’m for vronsky a pair of glove " " do " " but it be a pretty sight be not it " alexey alexandrovitch pause while there be talk about he but he begin again directly " I admit that manly sport do not " he be continue but at that moment the racer start and all conversation cease alexey alexandrovitch too be silent and everyone stand up and turn towards the stream alexey alexandrovitch take no interest in the race and so he do not watch the racer but fall listlessly to scan the spectator with his weary eye his

what he be speak of the dismay she be feel infect he too he see the smile and a strange misapprehension come over he " she be smile at my suspicion yes she will tell I directly what she tell I before

with he " in the little german wateringplace to which the shtcherbatskys have betake themselves as in all place indeed where people be gather together the usual process as it be of the crystallization of society go on assign to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place just as the particle of water in frost definitely and unalterably take the special form of the crystal of snow so each new person that arrive at the spring be at once place in his special place fürst shtcherbatsky sammt gemahlin und tochter by the apartment they take and from their name and from the friend they make be immediately crystallize into a definite place mark out for they there be visit the wateringplace that year a real german fürstin in consequence of which the crystallizing process go on more vigorously than ever princess shtcherbatskaya wish above everything to present her daughter to this german princess and the day after their arrival she duly perform this rite kitty make a low and graceful curtsey in the very simple that be to say very elegant frock that have be order she from paris the german princess say " I hope the rose will soon come back to this pretty little face " and for the shtcherbatskys certain definite line of existence be at once lay down from which there be no departing the shtcherbatskys make the acquaintance too of the family of an english lady somebody and of a german countess and her son wound in the last war and of a learned swede and of m canut and his sister but yet inevitably the shtcherbatskys be throw most into the society of a moscow lady marya yevgenyevna rtishtcheva and her daughter whom kitty dislike because she have fall ill like herself over a love affair and a moscow colonel whom kitty have know from childhood and always see in uniform and epaulet and who now with his little eye and his open neck and flowered cravat be uncommonly ridiculous and tedious because there be no get rid of he when all this be so firmly establish kitty begin to be very much bored especially as the prince go away to carlsbad and she be leave alone with her mother she take no interest in the people she know feel that nothing fresh would come of they her chief mental interest in the wateringplace consist in watch and make theory about the people she do not know it be characteristic of kitty that she always imagine everything in people in the most favorable light possible especially so in those she do not know and now as she make surmise as to who people be what be their relation to one another and what they be like kitty endow they with the most marvelous and noble character and find confirmation of her idea in her observation of these people the one that attract she most be a russian girl who have come to the wateringplace with an invalid russian lady madame stahl as everyone call she madame stahl belong to the high society but she be so ill that she could not walk and only on exceptionally fine day make her appearance at the spring in an invalid carriage but it be not so much from illhealth as from pride — so princess shtcherbatskaya interpret it — that madame stahl have not make the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there the russian girl look after madame stahl and besides that she be as kitty observe on friendly term with all the invalid who be seriously ill and there be many of they at the spring and look after they in the most natural way this russian girl be not as kitty gather relate to madame stahl nor be she a pay attendant madame stahl call she varenka and other people call she " mademoiselle varenka " apart from the interest kitty take in this girl ’s relation with madame stahl and with other unknown person kitty as often happen feel an inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka and be aware when their eye meet that she too like she of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she have pass her first youth but she be as it be a creature without youth she might have be take for nineteen or for thirty if her feature be criticize separately she be handsome rather than plain in spite of the sickly hue of her face she would have be a good figure too if it have not be for her extreme thinness and the size of her head which be too large for her medium height but she be not likely to be attractive to man she be like a fine flower already past its bloom and without fragrance though the petal be still unwithered moreover she would have be unattractive to man also from the lack of just what kitty have too much of — of the suppress fire of vitality and the consciousness of her own attractiveness she always seem absorb in work about which there could be no doubt and so it seem she could not take interest in anything outside it it be just this contrast with her own position that be for kitty the great attraction of mademoiselle varenka kitty feel that in she in her manner of life she would find an example of what she be now so painfully seek interest in life a dignity in life — apart from the worldly relation of girl with man which so revolt kitty and appear to she now as a shameful hawking about of good in search of a purchaser the more attentively kitty watch her unknown friend the more convinced she be this girl be the perfect creature she fancy she and the more eagerly she wish to make her acquaintance the two girl use to meet several time a day and every time they meet kitty ’s eye say " who be you what be you be you really the exquisite creature I imagine you to be but for goodness ' sake do not suppose " her eye add " that I would force my acquaintance on you I simply admire you and like you " " I like you too and you ’re very very sweet and I should like you well still if I have time " answer the eye of the unknown girl kitty see indeed that she be always busy either she be take the child of a russian family home from the spring or fetch a shawl for a sick lady and wrap she up in it or try to interest an irritable invalid or select and buy cake for tea for someone soon after the arrival of the shtcherbatskys there appear in the morning crowd at the springs two person who attract universal and unfavorable attention these be a tall man with a stooping figure and huge hand in an old coat too short for he with black simple and yet terrible eye and a pockmarked kindlooking woman very badly and tastelessly dress recognize these person as russians kitty have already in her imagination begin construct a delightful and touching romance about they but the princess have ascertain from the visitor ' list that this be nikolay levin and marya nikolaevna explain to kitty what a bad man this levin be and all her fancy about these two people vanish not so much from what her mother tell she as from the fact that it be konstantin ’s brother this pair suddenly seem to kitty intensely unpleasant this levin with his continual twitching of his head arouse in she now an irrepressible feeling of disgust it seem to she that his big terrible eye which persistently pursue she express a feeling of hatred and contempt and she try to avoid meet he it be a wet day it have be rain all the morning and the invalid with their parasol have flock into the arcade kitty be walk there with her mother and the moscow colonel smart and jaunty in his european coat buy readymade at frankfort they be walk on

funny to see your engouement " say the princess " no we ’d well go back " she add notice levin come towards they with his companion and a german doctor to whom he be talk very noisily and angrily they turn to go back when suddenly they hear not noisy talk but shout levin stop short be shout at the doctor and the doctor too be excited a crowd gather about they the princess and kitty beat a hasty retreat while the colonel join the crowd to find out what be the matter a few minute later the colonel overtake they " what be it " inquire the princess " scandalous and disgraceful " answer the colonel " the one thing to be dread be meet russians abroad that tall gentleman be abuse the doctor fling all sort of insult at he because he be not treat he quite as he like and he begin wave his

varenka sing another song also smoothly distinctly and well stand erect at the piano and beat time on it with her thin darkskinned hand the next song in the book be an italian one kitty play the open bar and look round at varenka " let ’s skip that " say varenka flush a little kitty let her eye rest on varenka ’s face with a look of dismay and inquiry " very well the next one " she say hurriedly

her handsome face of that fire which kitty feel must once have glow all over she " I do not think so why if I be a man I could never care for anyone else after know you only I can not understand how he could to please his mother forget you and make you unhappy he have no heart " " oh no he ’ a very good man and I ’m not unhappy quite the contrary I ’m very happy well so we shall not be singe any

account of his mother if it have be his own doing " say kitty feel she be give away her secret and that her face burn with the flush of shame have betray she already " in that case he would have do wrong and I should not have regret he " answer varenka evidently realize that they be now talk not of she but of kitty " but the humiliation " say kitty " the humiliation one can never forget can never forget " she say remember her look at the last ball during the pause in the music " where be the humiliation why you do nothing wrong " " bad than wrong — shameful " varenka shake her head and lay her hand on kitty ’s hand " why what be there shameful " she say " you do not tell a man who do not care for you that you love he do you " " of course not I never say a word but he know it no no there be look there be way I can not forget it if I live a hundred year " " why so I do not understand the whole point be whether you love he now or not " say varenka who call everything by its name " I hate he I can not forgive myself " " why what for " " the shame the humiliation " " oh if everyone be as sensitive as you be " say varenka " there be not a girl who have not be through the same and it ’ all so unimportant " " why what be important " say kitty look into her face with inquisitive wonder " oh there ’ so much that ’ important " say varenka smile " why what " " oh so much that ’ more important " answer varenka not know what to say but at that instant they hear the princess ’s voice from the window " kitty it ’ cold either get a shawl or come indoors " " it really be time to go in " say varenka get up " I have to go on to madame berthe ’s she ask I to " kitty hold she by the hand and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eye ask she " what be it what be this of such importance that give you such tranquillity you know tell I " but varenka do not even know what kitty ’s eye be ask she she merely think that she have to go to see madame berthe too that evening and to make haste home in time for maman ’s tea at twelve o’clock she go indoors collect her music and say goodbye to everyone be about to go " allow I to see you home " say the colonel " yes how can you go alone at night like this " chime in the princess " anyway I ’ll send parasha " kitty see that varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she need an escort " no I always go about alone and nothing ever happen to I " she say take her hat and kiss kitty once more without say what be important she step out courageously with the music under her arm and vanish into the twilight of the summer night bear away with she her secret of what be important and what give she the calm and dignity so much to be envy kitty make the acquaintance of madame stahl too and this acquaintance together with her friendship with varenka do not merely exercise a great influence on she it also comfort she in her mental distress she find this comfort through a completely new world be open to she by mean of this acquaintance a world have nothing in common with she past an exalted noble world from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly it be reveal to she that besides the instinctive life to which kitty have give herself up hitherto there be a spiritual life this life be disclose in religion but a religion have nothing in common with that one which kitty have know from childhood and which find expression in litany and allnight service at the widow ’s home where one might meet one ’s friend and in learn by heart slavonic text with the priest this be a lofty mysterious religion connect with a whole series of noble thought and feeling which one could do more than merely believe because one be tell to which one could love kitty find all this out not from word madame stahl talk to kitty as to a charming child that one look on with pleasure as on the memory of one ’s youth and only once she say in passing that in all human sorrow nothing give comfort but love and faith and that in the sight of christ ’s compassion for we no sorrow be trifling — and immediately talk of other thing but in every gesture of madame stahl in every word in every heavenly — as kitty call it — look and above all in the whole story of her life which she hear from varenka kitty recognize that something " that be important " of which till then she have know nothing yet elevated as madame stahl ’s character be touching as be her story and exalted and moving as be her speech kitty could not help detect in she some trait which perplex she she notice that when question she about her family madame stahl have smile contemptuously which be not in accord with christian meekness she notice too that when she have find a catholic priest with she madame stahl have studiously keep her face in the shadow of the lampshade and have smile in a peculiar way trivial as these two observation be they perplex she and she have her doubt as to madame stahl but on the other hand varenka alone in the world without friend or relation with a melancholy disappointment in the past desire nothing regret nothing be just that perfection of which kitty dare hardly dream in varenka she realize that one have but to forget oneself and love other and one will be calm happy and noble and that be what kitty long to be see now clearly what be the most important kitty be not satisfied with be enthusiastic over it she at once give herself up with her whole soul to the new life that be open to she from varenka ’s account of the doing of madame stahl and other people whom she mention kitty have already construct the plan of her own future life she would like madame stahl ’s niece aline of whom varenka have talk to she a great deal seek out those who be in trouble wherever she might be live help they as far as she could give they the gospel read the gospel to the sick to criminal to the dying the idea of read the gospel to criminal as aline do particularly fascinate kitty but all these be secret dream of which kitty do not talk either to her mother or to varenka while await the time for carry out her plan on a large scale however kitty even then at the springs where there be so many people ill and unhappy readily find a chance for practice her new principle in imitation of varenka at first the princess notice nothing but that kitty be much under the influence of her engouement as she call it for madame stahl and still more for varenka she see that kitty do not merely imitate varenka in her conduct but unconsciously imitate she in her manner of walk of talk of blink her eye but later on the princess notice that apart from this adoration some kind of serious spiritual change be take place in her daughter the princess see that in the evening kitty read a french testament that madame stahl have give she — a thing she have never do before that she avoid society acquaintance and associate with the sick people who be under varenka ’s protection and especially one poor family that of a sick painter petrov kitty be unmistakably proud of play the part of a sister of mercy in that you all this be well enough and the princess have nothing to say against it especially as petrov ’s wife be a perfectly nice sort of woman and that the german princess notice kitty ’s devotion praise she call she an angel of consolation all this would have be very well if there have be no exaggeration but the princess see that her daughter be rush into extreme and so indeed she tell she " il ne faut jamais rien outrer " she say to she her daughter make she no reply only in her heart she think that one could not talk about exaggeration where christianity be concern what exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one be bid to turn the other cheek when one be smite and give one ’s cloak if one ’s coat be take but the princess dislike this exaggeration and dislike even more the fact that she feel her daughter do not care to show she all her heart kitty do in fact conceal her new view and feeling from her mother she conceal they not because she do not respect or do not love her mother but simply because she be her mother she would have reveal they to anyone soon than to her mother " how be it anna pavlovna ’ not be to see we for so long " the princess say one day of madame petrova " I ’ve ask she but she seem put out about something " " no I ’ve
