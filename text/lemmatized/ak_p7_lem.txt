 the levins have be three month in moscow the date have long pass on which accord to the most trustworthy calculation of people learn in such matter kitty should have be confine but she be still about and there be nothing to show that her time be any near than two month ago the doctor the monthly nurse and dolly and her mother and most of all levin who could not think of the approach event without terror begin to be impatient and uneasy kitty be the only person who feel perfectly calm and happy she be distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child for she to some extent actually exist already and she brood blissfully over this feeling he be not by now altogether a part of herself but sometimes live his own life independently of she often this separate being give she pain but at the same time she want to laugh with a strange new you all the people she love be with she and all be so good to she so attentively care for she so entirely pleasant be everything present to she that if she have not know and feel that it must all soon be over she could not have wish for a well and pleasant life the only thing that spoil the charm of this manner of life be that her husband be not here as she love he to be and as he be in the country she like his serene friendly and hospitable manner in the country in the town he seem continually uneasy and on his guard as though he be afraid someone would be rude to he and still more to she at home in the country know himself distinctly to be in his right place he be never in haste to be off elsewhere he be never unoccupied here in town he be in a continual hurry as though afraid of miss something and yet he have nothing to do and she feel sorry for he to other she know he do not appear an object of pity on the contrary when kitty look at he in society as one sometimes look at those one love try to see he as if he be a stranger so as to catch the impression he must make on other she see with a panic even of jealous fear that he be far indeed from be a pitiable figure that he be very attractive with his fine breeding his rather oldfashioned reserved courtesy with woman his powerful figure and strike as she think and expressive face but she see he not from without but from within she see that here he be not himself that be the only way she could define his condition to herself sometimes she inwardly reproach he for his inability to live in the town sometimes she recognize that it be really hard for he to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with it what have he to do indeed he do not care for card he do not go to a club spend the time with jovial gentleman of oblonsky ’s type — she know now what that mean   it mean drinking and go somewhere after drinking she could not think without horror of where man go on such occasion be he to go into society but she know he could only find satisfaction in that if he take pleasure in the society of young woman and that she could not wish for should he stay at home with she her mother and her sister but much as she like and enjoy their conversation forever on the same subjects—“alinenadine " as the old prince call the sister ' talk — she know it must bore he what be there leave for he to do to go on write at his book he have indeed attempt and at first he use to go to the library and make extract and look up reference for his book but as he tell she the more he do nothing the less time he have to do anything and besides he complain that he have talk too much about his book here and that you all his idea about it be muddled and have lose their interest for he one advantage in this town life be that quarrel hardly ever happen between they here in town whether it be that their condition be different or that they have both become more careful and sensible in that respect they have no quarrel in moscow from jealousy which they have so dread when they move from the country one event an event of great importance to both from that point of view do indeed happen — that be kitty ’s meeting with vronsky the old princess marya borissovna kitty ’s godmother who have always be very fond of she have insist on see her kitty though she do not go into society at all on account of her condition go with her father to see the venerable old lady and there meet vronsky the only thing kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting be that at the instant when she recognize in his civilian dress the feature once so familiar to she her breath fail she the blood rush to her heart and a vivid blush — she feel it — overspread her face but this last only a few second before her father who purposely begin talk in a loud voice to vronsky have finish she be perfectly ready to look at vronsky to speak to he if necessary exactly as she speak to princess marya borissovna and more than that to do so in such a way that everything to the faint intonation and smile would have be approve by her husband whose unseen presence she seem to feel about she at that instant she say a few word to he even smile serenely at his joke about the election which he call " our parliament " she have to smile to show she see the joke but she turn away immediately to princess marya borissovna and do not once glance at he till he get up to go then she look at he but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he be say goodbye she be grateful to her father for say nothing to she about their meet vronsky but she see by his special warmth to she after the visit during their usual walk that he be pleased with she she be pleased with herself she have not expect she would have have the power while keep somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memory of her old feeling for vronsky not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with he levin flush a great deal more than she when she tell he she have meet vronsky at princess marya borissovna ’s it be very hard for she to tell he this but still hard to go on speak of the detail of the meeting as he do not question she but simply gaze at she with a frown " I be very sorry you be not there " she say " not that you be not in the room   I could not have be so natural in your presence   I be blush now much more much much more " she say blush till the tear come into her eye " but that you could not see through a crack " the truthful eye tell levin that she be satisfied with herself and in spite of her blush he be quickly reassure and begin question she which be all she want when he have hear everything even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flush but that afterwards she be just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance levin be quite happy again and say he be glad of it and would not now behave as stupidly as he have do at the election but would try the first time he meet vronsky to be as friendly as possible " it ’ so wretched to feel that there ’ a man almost an enemy whom it ’ painful to meet " say levin " I ’m very very glad " " go please go then and call on the bol " kitty say to her husband when he come in to see she at eleven o’clock before go out " I know you be dine at the club papa put down your name but what be you go to do in the morning " " I be only go to katavasov " answer levin " why so early " " he promise to introduce I to metrov

but money seem to fly away simply we do not manage well somehow " " oh it ’ all right " he say with a little cough look at she from under his brow that cough she know well it be a sign of intense dissatisfaction not with she but with himself he certainly be displeased not at so much money be spend but at be remind of what he know something be unsatisfactory want to forget " I have tell sokolov to sell the wheat and to borrow an advance on the mill we shall have money enough in any case " " yes but I ’m afraid that altogether " " oh it ’ all right all right " he repeat " well goodbye darling " " no I ’m really sorry sometimes that I listen to mamma how nice it would have be in the country as it be I ’m worry you all and we ’re waste our money " " not at all not at all not once since I ’ve be marry have I say that thing could have be well than they be " " truly " she say look into his eye he have say it without think simply to console she but when he glance at she and see those sweet truthful eye fasten questioningly on he he repeat it with his whole heart " I be positively forget she " he think and he remember what be before they so soon to come " will it be soon how do you feel " he whisper take she two hand " I have so often think so that now I do not think about it or know anything about it " " and you ’re not frightened " she smile contemptuously " not the least little bit " she say " well if anything happen I shall be at katavasov ’s " " no nothing will happen and do not think about it I ’m go for a walk on the boulevard with papa we ’re go to see dolly I shall expect you before dinner oh yes do you know that dolly ’s position be become utterly impossible she ’ in debt all round she have not a penny we be talk yesterday with mamma and arseny " this be her sister ’s husband lvov " and we determined to send you with he to talk to stiva it ’ really unbearable one can not speak to papa about it but if you and he " " why what can we do " say levin " you ’ll be at arseny ’s anyway talk to he he will tell what we decide " " oh I agree to everything arseny think beforehand I ’ll go and see he by the way if I do go to the concert I ’ll go with natalia well goodbye " on the step levin be stop by his old servant kouzma who have be with he before his marriage and now look after their household in town " beauty " that be the left shafthorse bring up from the country " have be badly shod and be quite lame " he say " what do your honor wish to be do " during the first part of their stay in moscow levin have use his own horse bring up from the country he have try to arrange this part of their expense in the good and cheap way possible but it appear that their own horse come dear than hire horse and they still hire too " send for the veterinary there may be a bruise " " and for katerina alexandrovna " ask kouzma levin be not by now strike as he have be at first by the fact that to get from one end of moscow to the other he have to have two powerful horse put into a heavy carriage to take the carriage three mile through the snowy slush and to keep it stand there four hour pay five rouble every time now it seem quite natural " hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster " say he " yes sir " and so simply and easily thank to the facility of town life levin settle a question which in the country would have call for so much personal trouble and exertion and go out onto the step he call a sledge sit down and drive to nikitsky on the way he think no more of money but muse on the introduction that await he to the petersburg savant a writer on sociology and what he would say to he about his book only during the first day of his stay in moscow levin have be strike by the expenditure strange to one live in the country unproductive but inevitable that be expect of he on every side but by now he have grow used to it that have happen to he in this matter which be say to happen to drunkard — the first glass stick in the throat the second fly down like a hawk but after the third they ’re like tiny little bird when levin have change his first hundredrouble note to pay for livery for his footman and hallporter he could not help reflect that these livery be of no use to anyone — but they be indubitably necessary to judge by the amazement of the princess and kitty when he suggest that they might do without livery — that these livery would cost the wage of two laborer for the summer that is would pay for about three hundred work day from easter to ash wednesday and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening — and that hundredrouble note do stick in his throat but the next note change to pay for provide a dinner for their relation that cost twentyeight rouble though it do excite in levin the reflection that twentyeight rouble mean nine measure of oats which man would with groan and sweat have reap and bind and thrash and winnow and sift and sow — this next one he part with more easily and now the note he change no long arouse such reflection and they fly off like little bird whether the labor devote to obtain the money correspond to the pleasure give by what be buy with it be a consideration he have long ago dismiss his business calculation that there be a certain price below which he could not sell certain grain be forget too the rye for the price of which he have so long hold out have be sell for fifty kopeck a measure cheap than it have be fetch a month ago even the consideration that with such an expenditure he could not go on live for a year without debt that even have no force only one thing be essential to have money in the bank without inquire where it come from so as to know that one have the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow and this condition have hitherto be fulfil he have always have the money in the bank but now the money in the bank have go and he could not quite tell where to get the next installment and this it be which at the moment when kitty have mention money have disturb he but he have no time to think about it he drive off think of katavasov and the meeting with metrov that be before he levin have on this visit to town see a great deal of his old friend at the university professor katavasov whom he have not see since his marriage he like in katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life levin think that the clearness of katavasov ’s conception of life be due to the poverty of his nature katavasov think that the disconnectedness of levin ’s idea be due to his lack of intellectual discipline but levin enjoy katavasov ’s clearness and katavasov enjoy the abundance of levin ’s untrained idea and they like to meet and to discuss levin have read katavasov some part of his book and he have like they on the previous day katavasov have meet levin at a public lecture and tell he that the celebrated metrov whose article levin have so much like be in moscow that he have be much interested by what katavasov have tell he about levin ’s work and that he be come to see he tomorrow at eleven and would be very glad to make levin ’s acquaintance " you ’re positively a reformed character I ’m glad to see " say katavasov meet levin in the little drawingroom " I hear the bell and think impossible that it can be he at the exact time well what do you say to the montenegrins now they ’re a race of warrior " " why what ’ happen " ask levin katavasov in a few word tell he the last piece of news from the war and go into his study introduce levin to a short thickset man of pleasant appearance this be metrov the conversation touch for a brief space on politic and on how recent event be look at in the high sphere in petersburg metrov repeat a saying that have reach he through a most trustworthy source report as have be utter on this subject by the tsar and one of the minister katavasov have hear also on excellent authority that the tsar have say something quite different levin try to imagine circumstance in which both saying might have be utter and the conversation on that topic drop " yes here he ’ write almost a book on the natural condition of the laborer in relation to the land " say katavasov " I ’m not a specialist but I as a natural science man be pleased at his not take mankind as something outside biological law but on the contrary see his dependence on his surrounding and in that dependence seek the law of his development " " that ’ very interesting " say metrov " what I begin precisely be to write a book on agriculture but study the chief instrument of agriculture the laborer " say levin reddening " I could not help come to quite unexpected result " and levin begin carefully as it be feel his ground to expound his view he know metrov have write an article against the generally accept theory of political economy but to what extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new view he do not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man " but in what do you see the special characteristic of the russian laborer " say metrov " in his biological characteristic so to speak or in the condition in which he be place " levin see that there be an idea underlie this question with which he do not agree but he go on explain his own idea that the russian laborer have a quite special view of the land different from that of other people and to support this proposition he make haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the russian peasant be due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanse in the east " one may easily be lead into error in base any conclusion on the general vocation of a people " say metrov interrupt levin " the condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital " and without let levin finish explain his idea metrov begin expound to he the special point of his own theory in what the point of his theory lie levin do not understand because he do not take the trouble to understand he see that metrov like other people in spite of his own article in which he have attack the current theory of political economy look at the position of the russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital wage and rent he would indeed have be oblige to admit that in the eastern — much the large — part of russia rent be as yet nil that for ninetenth of the eighty million of the russian peasant wage take the form simply of food provide for themselves and that capital do not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tool yet it be only from that point of view that he consider every laborer though in many point he differ from the economist and have his own theory of the wagefund which he expound to levin levin listen reluctantly and at first make objection he would have like to interrupt metrov to explain his own thought which in his opinion would have render further exposition of metrov ’s theory superfluous but later on feel convinced that they look at the matter so differently that they could never understand one another he do not even oppose his statement but simply listen although what metrov be say be by now utterly devoid of interest for he he yet experience a certain satisfaction in listen to he it flatter his vanity that such a learned man should explain his idea to he so eagerly with such intensity and confidence in levin ’s understanding of the subject sometimes with a mere hint refer he to a whole aspect of the subject he put this down to his own credit unaware that metrov who have already discuss his theory over and over again with all his intimate friend talk of it with special eagerness to every new person and in general be eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interest he even if still obscure to himself " we be late though " say katavasov look at his watch directly metrov have finish his discourse " yes there ’ a meeting of the society of amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of svintitch " say katavasov in answer to levin ’s inquiry " pyotr ivanovitch and I be go I ’ve promise to deliver an address on his labor in zoology come along with we it ’ very interesting " " yes and indeed it ’ time to start " say metrov " come with we and from there if you care to come to my place I should very much like to hear your work " " oh no it ’ no good yet it ’ unfinished but I shall be very glad to go to the meeting " " I say friend have you hear he have hand in the separate report " katavasov call from the other room where he be put on his frock coat and a conversation spring up upon the university question which be a very important event that winter in moscow three old professor in the council have not accept the opinion of the young professor the young one have register a separate resolution this in the judgment of some people be monstrous in the judgment of other it be the simple and most just thing to do and the professor be split up into two party one party to which katavasov belong see in the opposite party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery while the opposite party see in they childishness and lack of respect for the authority levin though he do not belong to the university have several time already during his stay in moscow hear and talk about this matter and have his own opinion on the subject he take part in the conversation that be continue in the street as you all three walk to the building of the old university the meeting have already begin round the clothcovered table at which katavasov and metrov seat themselves there be some halfdozen person and one of these be bend close over a manuscript read something aloud levin sit down in one of the empty chair that be stand round the table and in a whisper ask a student sit near what be be read the student eye levin with displeasure say " biography " though levin be not interested in the biography he could not help listen and learn some new and interesting fact about the life of the distinguished man of science when the reader have finish the chairman thank he and read some verse of the poet ment send he on the jubilee and say a few word by way of thank to the poet then katavasov in his loud ring voice read his address on the scientific labor of the man whose jubilee be be keep when katavasov have finish levin look at his watch see it be past one and think that there would not be time before the concert to read metrov his book and indeed he do not now care to do so during the reading he have think over their conversation he see distinctly now that though metrov ’s idea might perhaps have value his own idea have a value too and their idea could only be make clear and lead to something if each work separately in his choose path and that nothing would be gain by put their idea together and have make up his mind to refuse metrov ’s invitation levin go up to he at the end of the meeting metrov introduce levin to the chairman with whom he be talk of the political news metrov tell the chairman what he have already tell levin and levin make the same remark on his news that he have already make that morning but for the sake of variety he express also a new opinion which have only just strike he after that the conversation turn again on the university question as levin have already hear it all he make haste to tell metrov that he be sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation take leave and drive to lvov ’s lvov the husband of natalia kitty ’s sister have spend all his life in foreign capital where he have be educate and have be in the diplomatic service during the previous year he have leave the diplomatic service not owe to any " unpleasantness " he never have any " unpleasantness " with anyone and be transfer to the department of the court of the palace in moscow in order to give his two boy the good education possible in spite of the striking contrast in their habit and view and the fact that lvov be old than levin they have see a great deal of one another that winter and have take a great liking to each other lvov be at home and levin go in to he unannounced lvov in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoe be sit in an armchair and with a pincenez with blue glass he be read a book that stand on a reading desk while in his beautiful hand he hold a halfburned cigarette daintily away from he his handsome delicate and still youthfullooking face to which his curly glisten silvery hair give a still more aristocratic air light up with a smile when he see levin " capital I be mean to send to you how ’ kitty sit here it ’ more comfortable " he get up and push up a rocking chair " have you read the last circular in the journal de st pétersbourg I think it ’ excellent " he say with a slight french accent levin tell he what he have hear from katavasov be be say in petersburg and after talk a little about politic he tell he of his interview with metrov and the learned society ’s meeting to lvov it be very interesting " that ’ what I envy you that you be able to mix in these interesting scientific circle " he say and as he talk he pass as usual into french which be easy to he " it ’ true I have not the time for it my official work and the child leave I no time and then I ’m not ashamed to own that my education have be too defective " " that I do not believe " say levin with a smile feel as he always do touch at lvov ’s low opinion of himself which be not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest but be absolutely sincere " oh yes indeed I feel now how badly educate I be to educate my child I positively have to look up a great deal and in fact simply to study myself for it ’ not enough to have teacher there must be someone to look after they just as on your land you want laborer and an overseer see what I ’m reading”—he point to buslaev ’s grammar on the desk—“it ’ expect of misha and it ’ so difficult come explain to I here he say " levin try to explain to he that it could not be understand but that it have to be teach but lvov would not agree with he " oh you ’re laugh at it " " on the contrary you can not imagine how when I look at you I ’m always learn the task that lie before I that be the education of one ’s child " " well there ’ nothing for you to learn " say lvov " all I know " say levin " be that I have never see well broughtup child than yours and I would not wish for child well than yours " lvov visibly try to restrain the expression of his delight but he be positively radiant with smile " if only they ’re well than I that ’ all I desire you do not know you all the work " he say " with boy who ’ve be leave like mine to run wild abroad " " you ’ll catch all that up they ’re such clever child the great thing be the education of character that ’ what I learn when I look at your child " " you talk of the education of character you can not imagine how difficult that be you have hardly succeed in combat one tendency when other crop up and the struggle begin again if one have not a support in religion — you remember we talk about that — no father could bring child up rely on his own strength alone without that help " this subject which always interest levin be cut short by the entrance of the beauty natalia alexandrovna dress to go out " I do not know you be here " she say unmistakably feel no regret but a positive pleasure in interrupt this conversation on a topic she have hear so much of that she be by now weary of it " well how be kitty I be dine with you today I tell you what arseny " she turn to her husband " you take the carriage " and the husband and wife begin to discuss their arrangement for the day as the husband have to drive to meet someone on official business while the wife have to go to the concert and some public meeting of a committee on the eastern question there be a great deal to consider and settle levin have to take part in their plan as one of themselves it be settle that levin should go with natalia to the concert and the meeting and that from there they should send the carriage to the office for arseny and he should call for she and take she to kitty ’s or that if he have not finish his work he should send the carriage back and levin would go with she " he ’ spoil I " lvov say to his wife " he assure I that our child be splendid when I know how much that ’ bad there be in they " " arseny go to extreme I always say " say his wife " if you look for perfection you will never be satisfied and it ’ true as papa say — that when we be bring up there be one extreme — we be keep in the basement while our parent live in the good room now it ’ just the other way — the parent be in the wash house while the child be in the good room parent now be not expect to live at all but to exist altogether for their child " " well what if they like it well " lvov say with his beautiful smile touch her hand " anyone who do not know you would think you be a stepmother not a true mother " " no extreme be not good in anything " natalia say serenely put his paperknife straight in its proper place on the table " well come here you perfect child " lvov say to the two handsome boy who come in and after bow to levin go up to their father obviously wish to ask he about something levin would have like to talk to they to hear what they would say to their father but natalia begin talk to he and then lvov ’s colleague in the service mahotin walk in wear his court uniform to go with he to meet someone and a conversation be keep up without a break upon herzegovina princess korzinskaya the town council and the sudden death of madame apraksina levin even forget the commission intrust to he he recollect it as he be go into the hall " oh kitty tell I to talk to you about oblonsky " he say as lvov be stand on the stair see his wife and levin off " yes yes maman want we les beauxfrères to attack he " he say blush " but why should I " " well then I will attack he " say madame lvova with a smile stand in her white sheepskin cape wait till they have finish speak " come let we go " at the concert in the afternoon two very interesting thing be perform one be a fantasia king lear the other be a quartette dedicate to the memory of bach both be new and in the new style and levin be eager to form an opinion of they after escort his sisterinlaw to her stall he stand against a column and try to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible he try not to let his attention be distract and not to spoil his impression by look at the conductor in a white tie wave his arm which always disturb his enjoyment of music so much or the lady in bonnet with string carefully tie over their ear and all these people either think of nothing at all or think of all sort of thing except the music he try to avoid meet musical connoisseur or talkative acquaintance and stand look at the floor straight before he listen but the more he listen to the fantasia of king lear the far he feel from form any definite opinion of it there be as it be a continual beginning a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling but it fall to piece again directly break into new musical motive or simply nothing but the whim of the composer exceedingly complex but disconnected sound and these fragmentary musical expression though sometimes beautiful be disagreeable because they be utterly unexpected and not lead up to by anything gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph follow one another without any connection like the emotion of a madman and those emotion like a madman ’s spring up quite unexpectedly during the whole of the performance levin feel like a deaf man watch people dance and be in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia be over and feel a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his attention loud applause resound on all side everyone get up move about and begin talk anxious to throw some light on his own perplexity from the impression of other levin begin to walk about look for connoisseur and be glad to see a wellknown musical amateur in conversation with pestsov whom he know " marvelous " pestsov be say in his mellow bass " how be you konstantin dmitrievitch particularly sculpturesque and plastic so to say and richly colored be that passage where you feel cordelia ’s approach where woman das ewig weibliche enter into conflict with fate be not it " " you mean   what have cordelia to do with it " levin ask timidly forget that the fantasia be suppose to represent king lear " cordelia come in   see here " say pestsov tap his finger on the satiny surface of the program he hold in his hand and pass it to levin only then levin recollect the title of the fantasia and make haste to read in the russian translation the line from shakespeare that be print on the back of the program " you can not follow it without that " say pestsov address levin as the person he have be speak to have go away and he have no one to talk to in the entr’acte levin and pestsov fall into an argument upon the merit and defect of music of the wagner school levin maintain that the mistake of wagner and all his follower lie in their try to take music into the sphere of another art just as poetry go wrong when it try to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do and as an instance of this mistake he cite the sculptor who carve in marble certain poetic phantasm flit round the figure of the poet on the pedestal " these phantom be so far from be phantom that they be positively cling on the ladder " say levin the comparison please he but he could not remember whether he have not use the same phrase before and to pestsov too and as he say it he feel confused pestsov maintain that art be one and that it can attain its high manifestation only by conjunction with all kind of art the second piece that be perform levin could not hear pestsov who be stand beside he be talk to he almost all the time condemn the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity and compare it with the simplicity of the preraphaelites in painting as he go out levin meet many more acquaintance with whom he talk of politic of music and of common acquaintance among other he meet count bol whom he have utterly forget to call upon " well go at once then " madame lvova say when he tell she " perhaps they ’ll not be at home and then you can come to the meeting to fetch I you ’ll find I still there " " perhaps they ’re not at home " say levin as he go into the hall of countess bola ’s house " at home please walk in " say the porter resolutely remove his overcoat " how annoying " think levin with a sigh take off one glove and stroke his hat " what do I come for what have I to say to they " as he pass through the first drawingroom levin meet in the doorway countess bola give some order to a servant with a careworn and severe face on see levin

of propriety well you see in such a position any other woman would not have find resource in herself but you ’ll see how she have arrange her life — how calm how dignified she be to the left in the crescent opposite the church " shout stepan arkadyevitch lean out of the window " phew how hot it be " he say in spite of twelve degree of frost fling his open overcoat still wider open " but she have a daughter no doubt she ’ busy look after she " say levin " I believe you picture every woman simply as a female une couveuse " say stepan arkadyevitch " if she ’ occupy it must be with her child no she bring she up capitally I believe but one do not hear about she she ’ busy in the first place with what she write I see you ’re smile ironically but you ’re wrong she ’ write a child ’s book and do not talk about it to anyone but she read it to I and I give the manuscript to vorkuev   you know the publisher   and he ’ an author himself too I fancy he understand those thing and he say it ’ a remarkable piece of work but be you fancy she ’ an authoress — not a bit of it she ’ a woman with a heart before everything but you ’ll see now she have a little english girl with she and a whole family she ’ look after " " oh something in a philanthropic way " " why you will look at everything in the bad light it ’ not from philanthropy it ’ from the heart they — that be vronsky — have a trainer an englishman firstrate in his own line but a drunkard he ’ completely give up to drink — delirium tremens — and the family be cast on the world she see they help they get more and more interested in they and now the whole family be on her hand but not by way of patronage you know help with money she ’ herself prepare the boy in russian for the high school and she ’ take the little girl to live with she but you ’ll see she for yourself " the carriage drive into the courtyard and stepan arkadyevitch ring loudly at the entrance where sledge be stand and without ask the servant who open the door whether the lady be at home stepan arkadyevitch walk into the hall levin follow he more and more doubtful whether he be do right or wrong look at himself in the glass levin notice that he be red in the face but he feel certain he be not drunk and he follow stepan arkadyevitch up the carpeted stair at the top stepan arkadyevitch inquire of the footman who bow to he as to an intimate friend who be with anna arkadyevna and receive the answer that it be m vorkuev " where be they " " in the study " pass through the diningroom a room not very large with dark paneled wall stepan arkadyevitch and levin walk over the soft carpet to the halfdark study light up by a single lamp with a big dark shade another lamp with a reflector be hang on the wall light up a big fulllength portrait of a woman which levin could not help look at it be the portrait of anna paint in italy by mihailov while stepan arkadyevitch go behind the treillage and the man ’s voice which have be speak pause levin gaze at the portrait which stand out from the frame in the brilliant light throw on it and he could not tear himself away from it he positively forget where he be and not even hear what be say he could not take his eye off the marvelous portrait it be not a picture but a live charming woman with black curl hair with bare arm and shoulder with a pensive smile on the lip cover with soft down triumphantly and softly she look at he with eye that baffle he she be not live only because she be more beautiful than a live woman can be " I be delighted " he hear suddenly near he a voice unmistakably address he the voice of the very woman he have be admire in the portrait anna have come from behind the treillage to meet he and levin see in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait in a dark blue shot gown not in the same position nor with the same expression but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist have catch in the portrait she be less dazzling in reality but on the other hand there be something fresh and seductive in the live woman which be not in the portrait she have rise to meet he not conceal her pleasure at see he and in the quiet ease with which she hold out her little vigorous hand introduce he to vorkuev and indicate a redhaired pretty little girl who be sit at work call her her pupil levin recognize and like the manner of a woman of the great world always selfpossessed and natural " I be delighted delighted " she repeat and on her lip these simple word take for levin ’s ear a special significance " I have know you and like you for a long while both from your friendship with stiva and for your wife ’s sake I know she for a very short time but she leave on I the impression of an exquisite flower simply a flower and to think she will soon be a mother " she speak easily and without haste look now and then from levin to her brother and levin feel that the impression he be make be good and he feel immediately at home simple and happy with she as though he have know she from childhood " ivan petrovitch and I settle in alexey ’s study " she say in answer to stepan arkadyevitch ’s question whether he might smoke " just so as to be able to smoke”—and glance at levin instead of ask whether he would smoke she pull close a tortoiseshell cigarcase and take a cigarette " how be you feel today " her brother ask she " oh nothing nerve as usual " " yes be not it extraordinarily fine " say stepan arkadyevitch notice that levin be scrutinize the picture " I have never see a well portrait " " and extraordinarily like be not it " say vorkuev levin look from the portrait to the original a peculiar brilliance light up anna ’s face when she feel his eye on she levin flush and to cover his confusion would have ask whether she have see darya alexandrovna lately but at that moment anna speak " we be just talk ivan petrovitch and I of vashtchenkov ’s last picture have you see they " " yes I have see they " answer levin " but I beg your pardon I interrupt you   you be say " levin ask if she have see dolly lately " she be here yesterday she be very indignant with the high school people on grisha ’s account the latin teacher it seem have be unfair to he " " yes I have see his picture I do not care for they very much " levin go back to the subject she have start levin talk now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to the subject with which he have be talk all the morning every word in his conversation with she have a special significance and talk to she be pleasant still pleasant it be to listen to she anna talk not merely naturally and cleverly but cleverly and carelessly attach no value to her own idea and give great weight to the idea of the person she be talk to the conversation turn on the new movement in art on the new illustration of the bible by a french artist vorkuev attack the artist for a realism carry to the point of coarseness levin say that the french have carry conventionality far than anyone and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to realism in the fact of not lie they see poetry never have anything clever say by levin give he so much pleasure as this remark anna ’s face light up at once as at once she appreciate the thought she laugh " I laugh " she say " as one laugh when one see a very true portrait what you say so perfectly hit off french art now painting and literature too indeed — zola daudet but perhaps it be always so that man form their conception from fictitious conventional type and then — all the combinaison make — they be tired of the fictitious figure and begin to invent more natural true figure " " that ’ perfectly true " say vorknev " so you ’ve be at the club " she say to her brother " yes yes this be a woman " levin think forget himself and stare persistently at her lovely mobile face which at that moment be all at once completely transformed levin do not hear what she be talk of as she lean over to her brother but he be strike by the change of her expression her face — so handsome a moment before in its repose — suddenly wear a look of strange curiosity anger and pride but this last only an instant she drop her eyelid as though recollect something " oh well but that ’ of no interest to anyone " she say and she turn to the english girl " please order the tea in the drawingroom " she say in english the girl get up and go out " well how do she get through her examination " ask stepan arkadyevitch " splendidly she ’ a very gifted child and a sweet character " " it will end in your love she more than your own " " there a man speak in love there ’ no more nor less I love my daughter with one love and she with another " " I be just tell anna arkadyevna " say vorkuev " that if she be to put a hundredth part of the energy she devote to this english girl to the public question of the education of russian child she would be do a great and useful work " " yes but I can not help it I could not do it count alexey kirillovitch urge I very much " as she utter the word count alexey kirillovitch she glance with appealing timidity at levin and he unconsciously respond with a respectful and reassuring look " he urge I to take up the school in the village I visit it several time the child be very nice but I could not feel draw to the work you speak of energy energy rest upon love and come as it will there ’ no force it I take to this child — I could not myself say why " and she glance again at levin and her smile and her glance — all tell he that it be to he only she be address her word value his good opinion and at the same time sure beforehand that they understand each other " I quite understand that " levin answer " it ’ impossible to give one ’s heart to a school or such institution in general and I believe that ’ just why philanthropic institution always give such poor result " she be silent for a while then she smile " yes yes " she agree " I never could je n’ai pas le cœur assez large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girl cela ne m’a jamais réussi there be so many woman who have make themselves une position sociale in that way and now more than ever " she say with a mournful confiding expression ostensibly address her brother but unmistakably intend her word only for levin " now when I have such need of some occupation I can not " and suddenly frown levin see that she be frown at herself for talk about herself she change the subject " I know about you " she say to levin " that you ’re not a publicspirited citizen and I have defend you to the good of my ability " " how have you defend I " " oh accord to the attack make on you but will not you have some tea " she rise and take up a book bind in morocco " give it to I anna arkadyevna " say vorkuev indicate the book " it ’ well worth take up " " oh no it ’ all so sketchy " " I tell he about it " stepan arkadyevitch say to his sister nod at levin " you should not have my writing be something after the fashion of those little basket and carving which liza mertsalova use to sell I from the prison she have the direction of the prison department in that society " she turn to levin " and they be miracle of patience the work of those poor wretch " and levin see a new trait in this woman who attract he so extraordinarily besides wit grace and beauty she have truth she have no wish to hide from he all the bitterness of her position as she say that she sigh and her face suddenly take a hard expression look as it be turn to stone with that expression on her face she be more beautiful than ever but the expression be new it be utterly unlike that expression radiant with happiness and create happiness which have be catch by the painter in her portrait levin look more than once at the portrait and at her figure as take her brother ’s arm she walk with he to the high door and he feel for she a tenderness and pity at which he wonder himself she ask levin and vorkuev to go into the drawingroom while she stay behind to say a few word to her brother " about her divorce about vronsky and what he ’ do at the club about I " wonder levin and he be so keenly interested by the question of what she be say to stepan arkadyevitch that he scarcely hear what vorkuev be tell he of the quality of the story for child anna arkadyevna have write at tea the same pleasant sort of talk full of interesting matter continue there be not a single instant when a subject for conversation be to seek on the contrary it be feel that one have hardly time to say what one have to say and eagerly hold back to hear what the other be say and all that be say not only by she but by vorkuev and stepan arkadyevitch — all so it seem to levin gain peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism while he follow this interesting conversation levin be all the time admire she — her beauty her intelligence her culture and at the same time her directness and genuine depth of feeling he listen and talk and all the while he be think of her inner life try to divine her feeling and though he have judge she so severely hitherto now by some strange chain of reasoning he be justify she and be also sorry for she and afraid that vronsky do not fully understand she at eleven o’clock when stepan arkadyevitch get up to go vorkuev have leave early it seem to levin that he have only just come regretfully levin too rise " goodbye " she say hold his hand and glance into his face with a winning look " I be very glad que la glace est rompue " she drop his hand and half close her eye " tell your wife that I love she as before and that if she can not pardon I my position then my wish for she be that she may never pardon it to pardon it one must go through what I have go through and may god spare she that " " certainly yes I will tell she " levin say blush " what a marvelous sweet and unhappy woman " he be think as he step out into the frosty air with stepan arkadyevitch " well do not I tell you " say stepan arkadyevitch see that levin have be completely win over " yes " say levin dreamily " an extraordinary woman it ’ not her cleverness but she have such wonderful depth of feeling I ’m awfully sorry for she " " now please god everything will soon be settle well well do n’t be hard on people in future " say stepan arkadyevitch open the carriage door " goodbye we do not go the same way " still think of anna of everything even the simple phrase in their conversation with she and recall the minute change in her expression enter more and more into her position and feel sympathy for she levin reach home at home kouzma tell levin that katerina alexandrovna be quite well and that her sister have not long be go and he hand he two letter levin read they at once in the hall that he might not overlook they later one be from sokolov his bailiff sokolov write that the corn could not be sell that it be fetch only five and a half rouble and that more than that could not be get for it the other letter be from his sister she scold he for her business be still unsettled " well we must sell it at five and a half if we can not get more " levin decide the first question which have always before seem such a weighty one with extraordinary facility on the spot " it ’ extraordinary how all one ’s time be take up here " he think consider the second letter he feel himself to blame for not have get do what his sister have ask he to do for she " today again I ’ve not be to the court but today I ’ve certainly not have time " and resolve that he would not fail to do it next day he go up to his wife as he go in levin rapidly run through mentally the day he have spend all the event of the day be conversation conversation he have hear and take part in all the conversation be upon subject which if he have be alone at home he would never have take up but here they be very interesting and all these conversation be right enough only in two place there be something not quite right one be what he have say about the carp the other be something not " quite the thing " in the tender sympathy he be feel for anna levin find his wife lowspirited and dull the dinner of the three sister have go off very well but then they have wait and wait for he all of they have feel dull the sister have depart and she have be leave alone " well and what have you be do " she ask he look straight into his eye which shine with rather a suspicious brightness but that she might not prevent his tell she everything she conceal her close scrutiny of he and with an approving smile listen to his account of how he have spend the evening " well I ’m very glad I meet vronsky I feel quite at ease and natural with he you understand I shall try not to see he but I ’m glad that this awkwardness be all over " he say and remember that by way of try not to see he he have immediately go to call on anna he blush " we talk about the peasant drinking I do not know which drink most the peasantry or our own class the peasant do on holiday but " but kitty take not the slight interest in discuss the drinking habit of the peasant she see that he blush and she want to know why " well

for all he know now that he ought not to have do so kitty ’s eye open in a curious way and gleam at anna ’s name but control herself with an effort she conceal her emotion and deceive he " oh " be all she say " I ’m sure you will not be angry at my go stiva beg I to and dolly wish it " levin go on " oh no " she say but he see in her eye a constraint that bode he no good " she be a very sweet very

you go   to she of all people no we must go away I shall go away tomorrow " it be a long while before levin could soothe his wife at last he succeed in calm she only by confess that a feeling of pity in conjunction with the wine he have drink have be too much for he that he have succumb to anna ’s artful influence and that he would avoid she one thing he do with more sincerity confess to be that live so long in moscow a life of nothing but conversation eating and drinking he be degenerate they talk till three o’clock in the morning only at three o’clock be they sufficiently reconcile to be able to go to sleep after take leave of her guest anna do not sit down but begin walk up and down the room she have unconsciously the whole evening do her utmost to arouse in levin a feeling of love — as of late she have fall into do with all young man — and she know she have attain her aim as far as be possible in one evening with a married and conscientious man she like he indeed extremely and in spite of the striking difference from the masculine point of view between vronsky and levin as a woman she see something they have in common which have make kitty able to love both yet as soon as he be out of the room she cease to think of he one think and one only pursue she in different form and refuse to be shake off " if I have so much effect on other on this man who love his home and his wife why be it he be so cold to I not cold exactly he love I I know that but something new be draw we apart now why be not he here all the evening he tell stiva to say he could not leave yashvin and must watch over his play be yashvin a child but suppose it ’ true he never tell a lie but there ’ something else in it if it ’ true he be glad of an opportunity of show I that he have other duty I know that I submit to that but why prove that to I he want to show I that his love for I be not to interfere with his freedom but I need no proof I need love he ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for I here in moscow be this life I be not live but wait for an event which be continually put off and put off no answer again and stiva say he can not go to alexey alexandrovitch and I can not write again I can do nothing can begin nothing can alter nothing I hold myself in I wait invent amusement for myself — the english family writing reading — but it ’ all nothing but a sham it ’ all the same as morphine he ought to feel for I " she say feel tear of selfpity come into her eye she hear vronsky ’s abrupt ring and hurriedly dry her tear — not only dry her tear but sit down by a lamp and open a book affect composure she want to show he that she be displeased that he have not come home as he have promise — displeased only and not on any account to let he see her distress and least of all her selfpity she might pity herself but he must not pity she she do not want strife she blame he for want to quarrel but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism " well you ’ve not be dull " he say eagerly and goodhumoredly go up to she " what a terrible passion it be — gambling " " no I ’ve not be dull I ’ve learn long ago not to be dull stiva have be here and levin " " yes they mean to come and see you well how do you like levin " he say sit down beside she " very much they have not long be go what be yashvin do " " he be win — seventeen thousand I get he away he have really start home but he go back again and now he ’ lose " " then what do you stay for " she ask suddenly lift her eye to he the expression of her face be cold and ungracious " you tell stiva you be stay on to get yashvin away and you have leave he there " the same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appear on his face too " in the first place I do not ask he to give you any message and secondly I never tell lie but what ’ the chief point I want to stay and I stay " he say frown " anna what be it for why will you " he say after a moment ’s silence bend over towards she and he open his hand hope she would lay hers in it she be glad of this appeal for tenderness but some strange force of evil would not let she give herself up to her feeling as though the rule of warfare would not permit she to surrender " of course you want to stay and you stay you do everything you want to but what do you tell I that for with what object " she say get more and more excited " do anyone contest your right but you want to be right and you ’re welcome to be right " his hand close he turn away and his face wear a still more obstinate expression " for you it ’ a matter of obstinacy " she say watch he intently and suddenly find the right word for that expression that irritate she " simply obstinacy for you it ’ a question of whether you keep the upper hand of I while for I " again she feel sorry for herself and she almost burst into tear " if you know what it be for I when I feel as I do now that you be hostile yes hostile to I if you know what this mean for I if you know how I feel on the brink of calamity at this instant how afraid I be of myself " and she turn away hide her sob " but what be you talk about " he say horrify at her expression of despair and again bend over she he take her hand and kiss it " what be it for do I seek amusement outside our home do not I avoid the society of woman " " well yes if that be all " she say " come tell I what I ought to do to give you peace of mind I be ready to do anything to make you happy " he say touch by her expression of despair " what would not I do to save you from distress of any sort as now anna " he say " it ’ nothing nothing " she say " I do not know myself whether it ’ the solitary life my nerve come do not let we talk of it what about the race you have not tell I " she inquire try to conceal her triumph at the victory which have anyway be on her side he ask for supper and begin tell she about the race but in his tone in his eye which become more and more cold she see that he do not forgive she for her victory that the feeling of obstinacy with which she have be struggle have assert itself again in he he be cold to she than before as though he be regret his surrender and she remember the word that have give she the victory " how I feel on the brink of calamity how afraid I be of myself " see that this weapon be a dangerous one and that it could not be use a second time and she feel that beside the love that bind they together there have grow up between they some evil spirit of strife which she could not exorcise from his and still less from her own heart there be no condition to which a man can not become use especially if he see that all around he be live in the same way levin could not have believe three month before that he could have go quietly to sleep in the condition in which he be that day that lead an aimless irrational life live too beyond his mean after drink to excess he could not call what happen at the club anything else form inappropriately friendly relation with a man with whom his wife have once be in love and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman who could only be call a lost woman after be fascinate by that woman and cause his wife distress — he could still go quietly to sleep but under the influence of fatigue a sleepless night and the wine he have drink his sleep be sound and untroubled at five o’clock the creak of a door opening wake he he jump up and look round kitty be not in bed beside he but there be a light move behind the screen and he hear her step " what be it what be it " he say halfasleep " kitty what be it " " nothing " she say come from behind the screen with a candle in her hand " I feel unwell " she say smile a particularly sweet and meaning smile " what have it begin " he say in terror " we ought to send " and hurriedly he reach after his clothe " no no " she say smile and hold his hand " it ’ sure to be nothing I be rather unwell only a little it ’ all over now " and get into bed she blow out the candle lie down and be still though he think her stillness suspicious as though she be hold her breath and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which as she come from behind the screen she say " nothing " he be so sleepy that he fall asleep at once only later he remember the stillness of her breathing and understand all that must have be pass in her sweet precious heart while she lie beside he not stir in anticipation of the great event in a woman ’s life at seven o’clock he be wake by the touch of her hand on his shoulder and a gentle whisper she seem struggle between regret at wake he and the desire to talk to he " kostya do not be frightened it ’ all right but I fancy we ought to send for lizaveta petrovna " the candle be light again she be sit up in bed hold some knitting which she have be busy upon during the last few day " please do not be frightened it ’ all right I ’m not a bit afraid " she say see his scared face and she press his hand to her bosom and then to her lip he hurriedly jump up hardly awake and keep his eye fix on she as he put on his dressing gown then he stop still look at she he have to go but he could not tear himself from her eye he think he love her face know her expression her eye but never have he see it like this how hateful and horrible he seem to himself think of the distress he have cause she yesterday her flushed face fringe with soft curl hair under her night cap be radiant with joy and courage though there be so little that be complex or artificial in kitty ’s character in general levin be strike by what be reveal now when you all disguise be throw off and the very kernel of her soul shine in her eye and in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul she the very woman he love in she be more manifest than ever she look at he smile but all at once her brow twitch she throw up her head and go quickly up to he clutch his hand and press close up to he breathe her hot breath upon he she be in pain and be as it be complain to he of her suffering and for the first minute from habit it seem to he that he be to blame but in her eye there be a tenderness that tell he that she be far from reproach he that she love he for her suffering " if not I who be to blame for it " he think unconsciously seek someone responsible for this suffering for he to punish but there be no one responsible she be suffer complain and triumph in her suffering and rejoice in they and love they he see that something sublime be be accomplish in her soul but what he could not make it out it be beyond his understanding " I have send to mamma you go quickly to fetch lizaveta petrovna   kostya nothing it ’ over " she move away from he and ring the bell " well go now pasha ’ come I be all right " and levin see with astonishment that she have take up the knitting she have bring in in the night and begin work at it again as levin be go out of one door he hear the maidservant come in at the other he stand at the door and hear kitty give exact direction to the maid and begin to help she move the bedstead he dress and while they be put in his horse as a hire sledge be not to be see yet he

and he an unbeliever repeat these word not with his lip only at that instant he know that all his doubt even the impossibility of believe with his reason of which he be aware in himself do not in the least hinder his turning to god all of that now float out of his soul like dust to whom be he to turn if not to he in whose hand he feel himself his soul and his love the horse be not yet ready but

understand what be go on levin have prepare his mind to bear resolutely what be before he and without consider or anticipate anything to avoid upset his wife and on the contrary to soothe she and keep up her courage without allow himself even to think of what be to come of how it would end judge from his inquiry as to the usual duration of these ordeal levin have in his imagination brace himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his feeling for five hour and it have seem to he he could do this but when he come back from the doctor ’s and see her suffering again he fall to repeat more and more frequently " lord have mercy on we and succor we " he sigh and fling his head up and begin to feel afraid he could not bear it that he would burst into tear or run away such agony it be to he and only one hour have pass but after that hour there pass another hour two hour three the full five hour he have fix as the furth limit of his suffering and the position be still unchanged and he be still bear it because there be nothing to be do but bear it every instant feeling that he have reach the utmost limit of his endurance and that his heart would break with sympathy and pain but still the minute pass by and the hour and still hour more and his misery and horror grow and be more and more intense all the ordinary condition of life without which one can form no conception of anything have cease to exist for levin he lose all sense of time minute — those minute when she send for he and he hold her moist hand that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence and then push it away — seem to he hour and hour seem to he minute he be surprised when lizaveta petrovna ask he to light a candle behind a screen and he find that it be five o’clock in the afternoon if he have be tell it be only ten o’clock in the morning he would not have be more surprised where he be all this time he know as little as the time of anything he see her swollen face sometimes bewildered and in agony sometimes smile and try to reassure he he see the old princess too flushed and overwrought with her gray curl in disorder force herself to gulp down her tear bite her lip he see dolly too and the doctor smoke fat cigarette and lizaveta petrovna with a firm resolute reassuring face and the old prince walk up and down the hall with a frown face but why they come in and go out where they be he do not know the princess be with the doctor in the bedroom then in the study where a table set for dinner suddenly appear then she be not there but dolly be then levin remember he have be send

try to reassure he about the lamp and about his wife and he carry the holy picture and set it at kitty ’s head carefully tuck it in behind the pillow but where when and you all this have happen he could not tell he do not understand why the old princess take his hand and look compassionately at he beg he not to worry himself and dolly persuade he to eat something and lead he out of the room and even the doctor look seriously and with commiseration at he and offer he a drop of something all he know and feel be that what be happen be what have happen nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his brother nikolay but that have be grief — this be joy yet that grief and this joy be alike outside all the ordinary condition of life they be loophole as it be in that ordinary life through which there come glimpse of something sublime and in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul be exalt to inconceivable height of which it have before have no conception while reason lag behind unable to keep up with it " lord have mercy on we and succor we " he repeat to himself incessantly feel in spite of his long and as it seem complete alienation from religion that he turn to god just as trustfully and simply as he have in his childhood and first you all this time he have two distinct spiritual condition one be away from she with the doctor who keep smoke one fat cigarette after another and extinguish they on the edge of a full ashtray with dolly and with the old prince where there be talk about dinner about politic about marya petrovna ’s illness and where levin suddenly forget for a minute what be happen and feel as though he have wake up from sleep the other be in her presence at her pillow where his heart seem break and still do not break from sympathetic suffering and he pray to god without cease and every time he be bring back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reach he from the bedroom he fall into the same strange terror that have come upon he the first minute every time he hear a shriek he jump up run to justify himself remember on the way that he be not to blame and he long to defend she to help she but as he look at she he see again that help be impossible and he be fill with terror and pray " lord have mercy on we and help we " and as time go on both these condition become more intense the calm he become away from she completely forget she the more agonizing become both her suffering and his feeling of helplessness before they he jump up would have like to run away but run to she sometimes when again and again she call upon he he blame she but see her patient smile face and hear the word " I be worry you " he throw the blame on god but think of god at once he fall to beseech god to forgive he and have mercy he do not know whether it be late or early the candle have all burn out dolly have just be in the study and have suggest to the doctor that he should lie down levin sit listen to the doctor ’s story of a quack mesmerizer and look at the ashe of his cigarette there have be a period of repose and he have sink into oblivion he have completely forget what be go on now he hear the doctor ’s chat and understand it suddenly there come an unearthly shriek the shriek be so awful that levin do not even jump up but hold his breath gaze in terrified inquiry at the doctor the doctor put his head on one side listen and smile approvingly everything be so extraordinary that nothing could strike levin as strange " I suppose it must be so " he think and still sit where he be whose scream be this he jump up run on tiptoe to the bedroom edge round lizaveta petrovna and the princess and take up his position at kitty ’s pillow the scream have subside but there be some change now what it be he do not see and do not comprehend and he have no wish to see or comprehend but he see it by the face of lizaveta petrovna lizaveta petrovna ’s face be stern and pale and still as resolute though her jaw be twitch and her eye be fix intently on kitty kitty ’s swollen and agonized face a tress of hair cling to her moist brow be turn to he and seek his eye her lift hand ask for his hand clutch his chill hand in her moist one she begin squeeze they to her face " do not go do not go I ’m not afraid I ’m not afraid " she say rapidly " mamma take my earring they bother I you ’re not afraid quick quick

he see be the face of lizaveta petrovna it be even more frowning and stern kitty ’s face he do not know in the place where it have be be something that be fearful in its strained distortion and in the sound that come from it he fall down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed feel that his heart be burst the awful scream never pause it become still more awful and as though it have reach the utmost limit of terror suddenly it cease levin could not believe his ear but there could be no doubt the scream have cease and he hear a subdued stir and bustle and hurried breathing and her voice gasp alive tender and blissful utter softly " it ’ over " he lift his head with her hand hang exhausted on the quilt look extraordinarily lovely and serene she look at he in silence and try to smile and could not and suddenly from the mysterious and awful faraway world in which he have be live for the last twentytwo hour levin feel himself all in an instant bear back to the old everyday world glorify though now by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it the strained chord snap sob and tear of joy which he have never foresee rise up with such violence that his whole body shake that for long they prevent he from speak fall on his knee before the bed he hold his wife ’s hand before his lip and kiss it and the hand with a weak movement of the finger respond to his kiss and meanwhile there at the foot of the bed in the deft hand of lizaveta petrovna like a flicker light in a lamp lie the life of a human creature which have never exist before and which would now with the same right with the same importance to itself live and create in its own image " alive alive and a boy too set your mind at rest " levin hear lizaveta petrovna say as she slap the baby ’s back with a shake hand " mamma be it true " say kitty ’s voice the princess ’s sob be all the answer she could make and in the midst of the silence there come in unmistakable reply to the mother ’s question a voice quite unlike the subdued voice speak in the room it be the bold clamorous selfassertive squall of the new human being who have so incomprehensibly appear if levin have be tell before that kitty be dead and that he have die with she and that their child be angel and that god be stand before he he would have be surprised at nothing but now come back to the world of reality he have

when it be undress and he catch a glimpse of wee wee little hand little foot saffroncolored with little toe too and positively with a little big toe different from the rest and when he see lizaveta petrovna close the wideopen little hand as though they be soft spring and put they into linen garment such pity for the little creature come upon he and such terror that she would hurt it that he hold her hand back lizaveta petrovna laugh " do not be frightened do not be frightened " when the baby have be put to right and transform into a firm doll lizaveta petrovna dandle it as though proud of her

lip " a splendid baby " say lizaveta petrovna levin sigh with mortification this splendid baby excite in he no feeling but disgust and compassion it be not at all the feeling he have look forward to he turn away while lizaveta petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast suddenly laughter make he look round the baby have take the breast " come that ’ enough that ’ enough " say lizaveta petrovna but kitty would not let the baby go he fall asleep in her arm " look now " say kitty turn the baby so that he could see it the agedlooking little face suddenly pucker up still more and the baby sneeze smile hardly able to restrain his tear levin kiss his wife and go out of the dark room what he feel towards this little creature be utterly unlike what he have expect there be nothing cheerful and joyous in the feeling on the contrary it be a new torture of apprehension it be the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain and this sense be so painful at first the apprehension lest this helpless creature should suffer be so intense that it prevent he from notice the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he have feel when the baby sneeze stepan arkadyevitch ’s affair be in a very bad way the money for twothird of the forest have all be spend already and he have borrow from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount almost all the remain third the merchant would not give more especially as darya alexandrovna for the first time that winter insist on her right to her own property have refuse to sign the receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest all his salary go on household expense and in payment of petty debt that could not be put off there be positively no money this be unpleasant and awkward and in stepan arkadyevitch ’s opinion thing could not go on like this the explanation of the position be in his view to be find in the fact that his salary be too small the post he fill have be unmistakably very good five year ago but it be so no long petrov the bank director have twelve thousand sventitsky a company director have seventeen thousand mitin who have found a bank receive fifty thousand " clearly I ’ve be nap and they ’ve overlook I " stepan arkadyevitch think about himself and he begin keep his eye and ear open and towards the end of the winter he have discover a very good berth and have form a plan of attack upon it at first from moscow through aunt uncle and friend and then when the matter be well advanced in the spring he go himself to petersburg it be one of those snug lucrative berth of which there be so many more nowadays than there use to be with income range from one thousand to fifty thousand rouble it be the post of secretary of the committee of the amalgamate agency of the southern railways and of certain banking company this position like all such appointment call for such immense energy and such varied qualification that it be difficult for they to be find unite in any one man and since a man combine all the qualification be not to be find it be at least well that the post be fill by an honest than by a dishonest man and stepan arkadyevitch be not merely an honest man — unemphatically — in the common acceptation of the word he be an honest man — emphatically — in that special sense which the word have in moscow when they talk of an " honest " politician an " honest " writer an " honest " newspaper an " honest " institution an " honest " tendency mean not simply that the man or the institution be not dishonest but that they be capable on occasion of take a line of their own in opposition to the authority stepan arkadyevitch move in those circle in moscow in which that expression have come into use be regard there as an honest man and so have more right to this appointment than other the appointment yield an income of from seven to ten thousand a year and oblonsky could fill it without give up his government position it be in the hand of two minister one lady and two jews and all these people though the way have be pave already with they stepan arkadyevitch have to see in petersburg besides this business stepan arkadyevitch have promise his sister anna to obtain from karenin a definite answer on the question of divorce and beg fifty rouble from dolly he set off for petersburg stepan arkadyevitch sit in karenin ’s study listen to his report on the cause of the unsatisfactory position of russian finance and only wait for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own business or about anna " yes that ’ very true " he say when alexey alexandrovitch take off the pincenez without which he could not read now and look inquiringly at his former brotherinlaw " that ’ very true in particular case but still the principle of our day be freedom " " yes but I lie down another principle embrace the principle of freedom " say alexey alexandrovitch with emphasis on the word " embracing " and he put on his pincenez again so as to read the passage in which this statement be make and turn over the beautifully write widemargined manuscript alexey alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage " I do not advocate protection for the sake of private interest but for the public weal and for the low and upper class equally " he say look over his pincenez at oblonsky " but they can not grasp that they be take up now with personal interest and carry away by phrase " stepan arkadyevitch know that when karenin begin to talk of what they be do and think the person who would not accept his report and be the cause of everything wrong in russia that it be come near the end and so now he eagerly abandon the principle of freetrade and fully agree alexey alexandrovitch pause thoughtfully turn over the page of his manuscript " oh by the way " say stepan arkadyevitch " I want to ask you some time when you see pomorsky to drop he a hint that I should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies " stepan arkadyevitch be familiar by now with the title of the post he covet and he bring it out rapidly without mistake alexey alexandrovitch question he as to the duty of this new committee and ponder he be consider whether the new committee would not be act in some way contrary to the view he have be advocate but as the influence of the new committee be of a very complex nature and his view be of very wide application he could not decide this straight off and take off his pincenez he say " of course I can mention it to he but what be your reason precisely for wish to obtain the appointment " " it ’ a good salary rise to nine thousand and my mean " " nine thousand " repeat alexey alexandrovitch and he frown the high figure of the salary make he reflect that on that side stepan arkadyevitch ’s propose position run counter to the main tendency of his own project of reform which always lean towards economy " I consider and I have embody my view in a note on the subject that in our day these immense salary be evidence of the unsound economic assiette of our finance " " but what ’ to be do " say stepan arkadyevitch " suppose a bank director get ten thousand — well he ’ worth it or an engineer get twenty thousand — after all it ’ a grow thing you know " " I assume that a salary be the price pay for a commodity and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand if the salary be fix without any regard for that law as for instance when I see two engineer leave college together both equally well train and efficient and one get forty thousand while the other be satisfied with two or when I see lawyer and hussar have no special qualification appoint director of banking company with immense salary I conclude that the salary be not fix in accordance with the law of supply and demand but simply through personal interest and this be an abuse of great gravity in itself and one that react injuriously on the government service I consider " stepan arkadyevitch make haste to interrupt his brotherinlaw " yes but you must agree that it ’ a new institution of undoubted utility that ’ be start after all you know it ’ a grow thing what they lay particular stress on be the thing be carry on honestly " say stepan arkadyevitch with emphasis but the moscow significance of the word " honest " be lose on alexey alexandrovitch " honesty be only a negative qualification " he say " well you ’ll do I a great service anyway " say stepan arkadyevitch " by put in a word to pomorsky — just in the way of conversation " " but I fancy it ’ more in volgarinov ’s hand " say alexey alexandrovitch " volgarinov have fully assent as far as he ’ concern " say stepan arkadyevitch turn red stepan arkadyevitch redden at the mention of that name because he have be that morning at the jew volgarinov ’s and the visit have leave an unpleasant recollection stepan arkadyevitch believe most positively that the committee in which he be try to get an appointment be a new genuine and honest public body but that morning when volgarinov have — intentionally beyond a doubt — keep he two hour wait with other petitioner in his waiting room he have suddenly feel uneasy whether he be uncomfortable that he a descendant of rurik prince oblonsky have be keep for two hour wait to see a jew or that for the first time in his life he be not follow the example of his ancestor in serve the government but be turn off into a new career anyway he be very uncomfortable during those two hour in volgarinov ’s waiting room stepan arkadyevitch step jauntily about the room pull his whisker enter into conversation with the other petitioner and invent an epigram on his position assiduously conceal from other and even from himself the feeling he be experience but all the time he be uncomfortable and angry he could not have say why — whether because he could not get his epigram just right or from some other reason when at last volgarinov have receive he with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation and have all but refuse the favor ask of he stepan arkadyevitch have make haste to forget it all as soon as possible and now at the mere recollection he blush " now there be something I want to talk about and you know what it be about anna " stepan arkadyevitch say pause for a brief space and shake off the unpleasant impression as soon as oblonsky utter anna ’s name the face of alexey alexandrovitch be completely transform all the life be go out of it and it look weary and dead " what be it exactly that you want from I " he say move in his chair and snap his pincenez " a definite settlement alexey alexandrovitch some settlement of the position I ’m appeal to you " " not as an injured husband " stepan arkadyevitch be go to say but afraid of wreck his negotiation by this he change the word " not as a statesman " which do not sound à propos " but simply as a man and a goodhearted man and a christian you must have pity on she " he say " that be in what way precisely " karenin say softly " yes pity on she if you have see she as I have — I have be spend all the winter with she — you would have pity on she her position be awful simply awful " " I have imagine " answer alexey alexandrovitch in a high almost shrill voice " that anna arkadyevna have everything she have desire for herself " " oh alexey alexandrovitch for heaven ’s sake do not let we indulge in recrimination what be past be past and you know what she want and be wait for — divorce " " but I believe anna arkadyevna refuse a divorce if I make it a condition to leave I my son I reply in that sense and suppose that the matter be end I consider it at an end " shriek alexey alexandrovitch " but for heaven ’s sake do not get hot " say stepan arkadyevitch touch his brotherinlaw ’s knee " the matter be not end if you will allow I to recapitulate it be like this when you part you be as magnanimous as could possibly be you be ready to give she everything — freedom divorce even she appreciate that no do not think that she do appreciate it — to such a degree that at the first moment feel how she have wrong you she do not consider and could not consider everything she give up everything but experience time have show that her position be unbearable impossible " " the life of anna arkadyevna can have no interest for I " alexey alexandrovitch put in lift his eyebrow " allow I to disbelieve that " stepan arkadyevitch reply gently " her position be intolerable for she and of no benefit to anyone whatever she have deserve it you will say she know that and ask you for nothing she say plainly that she dare not ask you but I all of we her relative all who love she beg you entreat you why should she suffer who be any the well for it " " excuse I you seem to put I in the position of the guilty party " observe alexey alexandrovitch " oh no oh no not at all please understand I " say stepan arkadyevitch touch his hand again as though feel sure this physical contact would soften his brotherinlaw " all I say be this her position be intolerable and it might be alleviate by you and you will lose nothing by it I will arrange it all for you so that you ’ll not notice it you do promise it you know " " the promise be give before and I have suppose that the question of my son have settle the matter besides I have hope that anna arkadyevna have enough generosity " alexey alexandrovitch articulate with difficulty his lip twitch and his face white " she leave it all to your generosity she beg she implore one thing of you — to extricate she from the impossible position in which she be place she do not ask for her son now alexey alexandrovitch you be a good man put yourself in her position for a minute the question of divorce for she in her position be a question of life and death if you have not promise it once she would have reconcile herself to her position she would have go on live in the country but you promise it and she write to you and move to moscow and here she ’ be for six month in moscow where every chance meeting cut she to the heart every day expect an answer why it ’ like keep a condemn criminal for six month with the rope round his neck promise he perhaps death perhaps mercy have pity on she and I will undertake to arrange everything vos scrupules " " I be not talk about that about that " alexey alexandrovitch interrupt with disgust " but perhaps I promise what I have no right to promise " " so you go back from your promise " " I have never refuse to do all that be possible but I want time to consider how much of what I promise be possible " " no alexey alexandrovitch " cry oblonsky jump up " I will not believe that she ’ unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be and you can not refuse in such " " as much of what I promise as be possible vous professez d’être libre penseur but I as a believer can not in a matter of such gravity act in opposition to the christian law " " but in christian society and among we as far as I ’m aware divorce be allow " say stepan arkadyevitch " divorce be sanction even by our church and we see " " it be allow but not in the sense " " alexey alexandrovitch you be not like yourself " say oblonsky after a brief pause " be not it you and do not we all appreciate it in you who forgive everything and move simply by christian feeling be ready to make any sacrifice you say yourself if a man take thy coat give he thy cloak also and now " " I beg " say alexey alexandrovitch shrilly get suddenly onto his foot his face white and his jaw twitch " I beg you to drop this   to drop   this subject " " oh no oh forgive I forgive I if I have wound you " say stepan arkadyevitch hold out his hand with a smile of embarrassment " but like a messenger I have simply perform the commission give I " alexey alexandrovitch give he his hand ponder a little and say " I must think it over and seek for guidance the day after tomorrow I will give you a final answer " he say after consider a moment stepan arkadyevitch be about to go away when korney come in to announce " sergey alexyevitch " " who ’ sergey alexyevitch " stepan arkadyevitch be begin but he remember immediately " ah seryozha " he say aloud " sergey alexyevitch I think it be the director of a department anna ask I to see he too " he think and he recall the timid piteous expression with which anna have say to he at parting " anyway you will see he find out exactly where he be who be look after he and stiva   if it be possible could it be possible " stepan arkadyevitch know what be mean by that " if it be possible”—if it be possible to arrange the divorce so as to let she have her son stepan arkadyevitch see now that it be no good to dream of that but still he be glad to see his nephew alexey alexandrovitch remind his brotherinlaw that they never speak to the boy of his mother and he beg he not to mention a single word about she " he be very ill after that interview with his mother which we have not foresee " say alexey alexandrovitch " indeed we fear for his life but with rational treatment and seabathing in the summer he regain his strength and now by the doctor ’s advice I have let he go to school and certainly the companionship of school have have a good effect on he and he be perfectly well and make good progress " " what a fine fellow he ’ grow he ’ not seryozha now but quite fullfledged sergey alexyevitch " say stepan arkadyevitch smile as he look at the handsome broadshouldered lad in blue coat and long trouser who walk in alertly and confidently the boy look healthy and goodhumored he bow to his uncle as to a stranger but recognize he he blush and turn hurriedly away from he as though offend and irritated at something the boy go up to his father and hand he a note of the mark he have gain in school " well that ’ very fair " say his father " you can go " " he ’ thin and tall and have grow out of be a child into a boy I like that " say stepan arkadyevitch " do you remember I " the boy look back quickly at his uncle " yes mon oncle " he answer glance at his father and again he look downcast his uncle call he to he and take his hand " well and how be you get on " he say want to talk to he and not know what to say the boy blush and make no answer cautiously draw his hand away as soon as stepan arkadyevitch let go his hand he glance doubtfully at his father and like a bird set free he dart out of the room a year have pass since the last time seryozha have see his mother since then he have hear nothing more of she and in the course of that year he have go to school and make friend among his schoolfellow the dream and memory of his mother which have make he ill after see she do not occupy his thought now when they come back to he he studiously drive they away regard they as shameful and girlish below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy he know that his father and mother be separate by some quarrel he know that he have to remain with his father and he try to get used to that idea he dislike see his uncle so like his mother for it call up those memory of which he be ashamed he dislike it all the more as from some word he have catch as he wait at the study door and still more from the face of his father and uncle he guess that they must have be talk of his mother and to avoid condemn the father with whom he live and on whom he be dependent and above all to avoid give way to sentimentality which he consider so degrading seryozha try not to look at his uncle who have come to disturb his peace of mind and not to think of what he recall to he but when stepan arkadyevitch go out after he see he on the stair and call to he ask he how he spend his playtime at school seryozha talk more freely to he away from his father ’s presence " we have a railway now " he say in answer to his uncle ’s question " it ’ like this do you see two sit on a bench — they’re the passenger and one stand up straight on the bench and all be harness to it by their arm or by their belt and they run through all the room — the door be leave open beforehand well and it ’ pretty hard work be the conductor " " that ’ the one that stand " stepan arkadyevitch inquire smile " yes you want pluck for it and cleverness too especially when they stop all of a sudden or someone fall down " " yes that must be a serious matter " say stepan arkadyevitch watch with mournful interest the eager eye like his mother ’s not childish now — no long fully innocent and though he have promise alexey alexandrovitch not to speak of anna he could not restrain himself " do you remember your mother " he ask suddenly " no I do n’t " seryozha say quickly he blush crimson and his face cloud over and his uncle could get nothing more out of he his tutor find his pupil on the staircase half an hour later and for a long while he could not make out whether he be illtempered or cry " what be it I expect you hurt yourself when you fall down " say the tutor " I tell you it be a dangerous game and we shall have to speak to the director " " if I have hurt myself nobody should have find it out that ’ certain " " well what be it then " " leave I alone if I remember or if I do not remember what business be it of his why should I remember leave I in peace " he say address not his tutor but the whole world stepan arkadyevitch as usual do not waste his time in petersburg in petersburg besides business his sister ’s divorce and his coveted appointment he want as he always do to freshen himself up as he say after the mustiness of moscow in spite of its café chantants and its omnibus moscow be yet a stagnant bog stepan arkadyevitch always feel it after live for some time in moscow especially in close relation with his family he be conscious of a depression of spirit after be a long time in moscow without a change he reach a point when he positively begin to be worry himself over his wife ’s illhumor and reproach over his child ’s health and education and the petty detail of his official work even the fact of be in debt worry he but he have only to go and stay a little while in petersburg in the circle there in which he move where people live — really live — instead of vegetate as in moscow and all such idea vanish and melt away at once like wax before the fire his wife only that day he have be talk to prince tchetchensky prince tchetchensky have a wife and family grownup page in the corps   and he have another illegitimate family of child also though the first family be very nice too prince tchetchensky feel happy in his second family and he use to take his eld son with he to his second family and tell stepan arkadyevitch that he think it good for his son enlarge his idea what would have be say to that in moscow his child in petersburg child do not prevent their parent from enjoy life the child be bring up in school and there be no trace of the wild idea that prevail in moscow in lvov ’s household for instance that all the luxury of life be for the child while the parent have nothing but work and anxiety here people understand that a man be in duty bind to live for himself as every man of culture should live his official duty official work here be not the stiff hopeless drudgery that it be in moscow here there be some interest in official life a chance meeting a service render a happy phrase a knack of facetious mimicry and a man ’s career might be make in a trice so it have be with bryantsev whom stepan arkadyevitch have meet the previous day and who be one of the high functionary in government now there be some interest in official work like that the petersburg attitude on pecuniary matter have an especially soothing effect on stepan arkadyevitch bartnyansky who must spend at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he live in have make an interesting comment the day before on that subject as they be talk before dinner stepan arkadyevitch say to bartnyansky " you ’re friendly I fancy with mordvinsky you might do I a favor say a word to he please for I there ’ an appointment I should like to get — secretary of the agency " " oh I shall not remember all that if you tell it to I but what possess you to have to do with railway and jews take it as you will it ’ a low business " stepan arkadyevitch do not say to bartnyansky that it be a " growing thing”—bartnyansky would not have understand that " I want the money I ’ve nothing to live on " " you ’re live be not you " " yes but in debt " " be you though heavily " say bartnyansky sympathetically " very heavily twenty thousand " bartnyansky break into goodhumored laughter " oh lucky fellow " say he " my debt mount up to a million and a half and I ’ve nothing and still I can live as you see " and stepan arkadyevitch see the correctness of this view not in word only but in actual fact zhivahov owe three hundred thousand and have not a farthing to bless himself with and he live and in style too count krivtsov be consider a hopeless case by everyone and yet he keep two mistress petrovsky have run through five million and still live in just the same style and be even a manager in the financial department with a salary of twenty thousand but besides this petersburg have physically an agreeable effect on stepan arkadyevitch it make he young in moscow he sometimes find a gray hair in his head drop asleep after dinner stretch walk slowly upstairs breathe heavily be bore by the society of young woman and do not dance at ball in petersburg he always feel ten year young his experience in petersburg be exactly what have be describe to he on the previous day by prince pyotr oblonsky a man of sixty who have just come back from abroad " we do not know the way to live here " say pyotr oblonsky " I spend the summer in baden and you would not believe it I feel quite a young man at a glimpse of a pretty woman my thought one dine and drink a glass of wine and feel strong and ready for anything I come home to russia — have to see my wife and what ’ more go to my country place and there you ’d hardly believe it in a fortnight I ’d get into a dressing gown and give up dressing for dinner need not say I have no thought leave for pretty woman I become quite an old gentleman there be nothing leave for I but to think of my eternal salvation I go off to paris — I be as right as could be at once " stepan arkadyevitch feel exactly the difference that pyotr oblonsky describe in moscow he degenerate so much that if he have have to be there for long together he might in good earnest have come to consider his salvation in petersburg he feel himself a man of the world again between princess betsy tverskaya and stepan arkadyevitch there have long exist rather curious relation stepan arkadyevitch always flirt with she in jest and use to say to she also in jest the most unseemly thing know that nothing delight she so much the day after his conversation with karenin stepan arkadyevitch go to see she and feel so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense he recklessly go so far that he do not know how to extricate himself as unluckily he be so far from be attract by she that he think she positively disagreeable what make it hard to change the conversation be the fact that he be very attractive to she so that he be considerably relieve at the arrival of princess myakaya which cut short their têteàtête " ah so you ’re here " say she when she see he " well and what news of your poor sister you need not look at I like that " she add " ever since they ’ve all turn against she all those who ’re a thousand time bad than she I ’ve think she do a very fine thing I can not forgive vronsky for not let I know when she be in petersburg I ’d have go to see she and go about with she everywhere please give she my love come tell I about she " " yes her position be very difficult she " begin stepan arkadyevitch in the simplicity of his heart accept as sterling coin princess myakaya ’s word " tell I about she " princess myakaya interrupt he immediately as she always do and begin talk herself " she ’ do what you all do except I — only they hide it but she would not be deceitful and she do a fine thing and she do well still in throw up that crazy brotherinlaw of yours you must excuse I everybody use to say he be so clever so very clever I be the only one that say he be a fool now that he ’ so thick with lidia ivanovna and landau you all say he ’ crazy and I should prefer not to agree with everybody but this time I can not help it " " oh do please explain " say stepan arkadyevitch " what do it mean yesterday I be see he on my sister ’s behalf and I ask he to give I a final answer he give I no answer and say he would think it over but this morning instead of an answer I receive an invitation from countess lidia ivanovna for this evening " " ah so that ’ it that ’ it " say princess myakaya gleefully " they ’re go to ask landau what he ’ to say " " ask landau what for who or what ’ landau " " what you do not know jules landau le fameux jules landau le clairvoyant he ’ crazy too but on he your sister ’s fate depend see what come of live in the province — you know nothing about anything landau do you see be a commis in a shop in paris and he go to a doctor ’s and in the doctor ’s waiting room he fall asleep and in his sleep he begin give advice to all the patient and wonderful advice it be then the wife of yury meledinsky — you know the invalid — hear of this landau and have he to see her husband and he cure her husband though I can not say that I see he do he much good for he ’ just as feeble a creature as ever he be but they believe in he and take he along with they and bring he to russia here there ’ be a general rush to he and he ’ begin doctor everyone he cure countess bezzubova and she take such a fancy to he that she adopt he " " adopt he " " yes as her son he ’ not landau any more now but count bezzubov that ’ neither here nor there though but lidia — i’m very fond of she but she have a screw loose somewhere — have lose her heart to this landau now and nothing be settle now in her house or alexey alexandrovitch ’s without he and so your sister ’s fate be now in the hand of landau alias count bezzubov " after a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drink at bartnyansky ’s stepan arkadyevitch only a little later than the appoint time go in to countess lidia ivanovna ’s " who else be with the countess — a frenchman " stepan arkadyevitch ask the hallporter as he glance at the familiar overcoat of alexey alexandrovitch and a queer rather artlesslooking overcoat with clasp " alexey alexandrovitch karenin and count bezzubov " the porter answer severely " princess myakaya guess right " think stepan arkadyevitch as he go upstairs " curious it would be quite as well though to get on friendly term with she she have immense influence if she would say a word to pomorsky the thing would be a certainty " it be still quite light outofdoors but in countess lidia ivanovna ’s little drawingroom the blind be draw and the lamp light at a round table under a lamp sit the countess and alexey alexandrovitch talk softly a short thinnish man very pale and handsome with feminine hip and knockkneed leg with fine brilliant eye and long hair lie on the collar of his coat be stand at the end of the room gaze at the portrait on the wall after greet the lady of the house and alexey alexandrovitch stepan arkadyevitch could not resist glance once more at the unknown man " monsieur landau " the countess address he with a softness and caution that impress oblonsky and she introduce they landau look round hurriedly come up and smile lay his moist lifeless hand in stepan arkadyevitch ’s outstretched hand and immediately walk away and fall to gaze at the portrait again the countess and alexey alexandrovitch look at each other significantly " I be very glad to see you particularly today " say countess lidia ivanovna point stepan arkadyevitch to a seat beside karenin " I introduce you to he as landau " she say in a soft voice glance at the frenchman and again immediately after at alexey alexandrovitch " but he be really count bezzubov as you ’re probably aware only he do not like the title " " yes I hear so " answer stepan arkadyevitch " they say he completely cure countess bezzubova " " she be here today poor thing " the countess say turn to alexey alexandrovitch " this separation be awful for she it ’ such a blow to she " " and he positively be go " query alexey alexandrovitch " yes he ’ go to paris he hear a voice yesterday " say countess lidia ivanovna look at stepan arkadyevitch " ah a voice " repeat oblonsky feeling that he must be as circumspect as he possibly could in this society where something peculiar be go on or be to go on to which he have not the key a moment ’s silence follow after which countess lidia ivanovna as though approach the main topic of conversation say with a fine smile to oblonsky " I ’ve know you for a long while and be very glad to make a close acquaintance with you les amis de nos amis sont nos amis but to be a true friend one must enter into the spiritual state of one ’s friend and I fear that you be not do so in the case of alexey alexandrovitch you understand what I mean " she say lift her fine pensive eye " in part countess I understand the position of alexey alexandrovitch " say oblonsky have no clear idea what they be talk about he want to confine himself to generality " the change be not in his external position " countess lidia ivanovna say sternly follow with eye of love the figure of alexey alexandrovitch as he get up and cross over to landau " his heart be change a new heart have be vouchsafe he and I fear you do not fully apprehend the change that have take place in he " " oh well in general outline I can conceive the change we have always be friendly and now " say stepan arkadyevitch respond with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess and mentally balance the question with which of the two minister she be most intimate so as to know about which to ask she to speak for he " the change that have take place in he can not lessen his love for his neighbor on the contrary that change can only intensify love in his heart but I be afraid you do not understand I will not you have some tea " she say with her eye indicate the footman who be hand round tea on a tray " not quite countess of course his misfortune " " yes a misfortune which have prove the high happiness when his heart be make new be fill full of it " she say gaze with eye full of love at stepan arkadyevitch " I do believe I might ask she to speak to both of they " think stepan arkadyevitch " oh of course countess " he say " but I imagine such change be a matter so private that no one even the most intimate friend would care to speak of they " " on the contrary we ought to speak freely and help one another " " yes undoubtedly so but there be such a difference of conviction and besides " say oblonsky with a soft smile " there can be no difference where it be a question

the false interpretation of that passage nothing hold man back from belief like that misinterpretation ' I have not work so I can not believe ' though all the while that be not say but the very opposite be say " " strive for god save the soul by fast " say countess lidia ivanovna with disgusted contempt " those be the crude idea of our monk yet that be nowhere say it be far simple and easy "

bearing as he listen to countess lidia ivanovna aware of the beautiful artless — or perhaps artful he could not decide which — eye of landau fix upon he stepan arkadyevitch begin to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head the most incongruous idea be in confusion in his head " marie sanina be glad her child ’ dead how good a smoke would be now to be save one need only believe and the monk do not know how the thing ’ to be do but countess lidia ivanovna do know and why be my head so heavy be it the cognac or all this be so queer anyway I fancy I ’ve do nothing unsuitable so far but anyway it will not do to ask she now they say they make one say one ’s prayer I only hope they will not make I that ’ll be too imbecile and what stuff it be she ’ read but she have a good accent landau — bezzubov — what ’ he bezzubov for " all at once stepan arkadyevitch become aware that his low jaw be uncontrollably form a yawn he pull his whisker to cover the yawn and shake himself together but soon after he become aware that he be drop asleep and on the very point of snoring he recover himself at the very moment when the voice of countess lidia ivanovna be say " he ’ asleep " stepan arkadyevitch start with dismay feel guilty and catch but he be reassure at once by see that the word " he ’ asleep " refer not to he but to landau the frenchman be asleep as well as stepan arkadyevitch but stepan arkadyevitch ’s be asleep would have offend they as he think though even this he think might not be so as everything seem so queer while landau ’s be asleep delight they extremely especially countess lidia ivanovna " mon ami " say lidia ivanovna carefully hold the fold of her silk gown so as not to rustle and in her excitement call karenin not alexey alexandrovitch but " mon ami " " donnezlui la main vous voyez sh " she hiss at the footman as he come in again " not at home " the frenchman be asleep or pretend to be asleep with his head on the back of his chair and his moist hand as it lie on his knee make faint movement as though try to catch something alexey alexandrovitch get up try to move carefully but stumble against the table go up and lay his hand in the frenchman ’s hand stepan arkadyevitch get up too and open his eye wide try to wake himself up if he be asleep he look first at one and then at the other it be all real stepan arkadyevitch feel that his head be get bad and bad " que la personne qui est arrivée la dernière celle qui demande qu’elle sorte qu’elle sorte " articulate the frenchman without open his eye " vous m’excuserez mais vous voyez revenez vers dix heures encore mieux demain " " qu’elle sorte " repeat the frenchman impatiently " c’est moi n’estce pas " and receive an answer in the affirmative stepan arkadyevitch forget the favor he have mean to ask of lidia ivanovna and forget his sister ’s affair care for nothing but fill with the sole desire to get away as soon as possible go out on tiptoe and run out into the street as though from a plaguestricken house for a long while he chat and joke with his cabdriver try to recover his spirit at the french theater where he arrive for the last act and afterwards at the tatar restaurant after his champagne stepan arkadyevitch feel a little refreshed in the atmosphere he be used to but still he feel quite unlike himself all that evening on get home to pyotr oblonsky ’s where he be stay stepan arkadyevitch find a note from betsy she write to he that she be very anxious to finish their interrupt conversation and beg he to come next day he have scarcely read this note and frown at its content when he hear below the ponderous tramp of the servant carry something heavy stepan arkadyevitch go out to look it be the rejuvenated pyotr oblonsky he be so drunk that he could not walk upstairs but he tell they to set he on his leg when he see stepan arkadyevitch and cling to he walk with he into his room and there begin tell he how he have spend the evening and fall asleep do so stepan arkadyevitch be in very low spirit which happen rarely with he and for a long while he could not go to sleep everything he could recall to his mind everything be disgusting but most disgusting of all as if it be something shameful be the memory of the evening he have spend at countess lidia ivanovna ’s next day he receive from alexey alexandrovitch a final answer refuse to grant anna ’s divorce and he understand that this decision be base on what the frenchman have say in his real or pretended trance in order to carry through any undertaking in family life there must necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife or love agreement when the relation of a couple be vacillate and neither one thing nor the other no sort of enterprise can be undertake many family remain for year in the same place though both husband and wife be sick of it simply because there be neither complete division nor agreement between they both vronsky and anna feel life in moscow insupportable in the heat and dust when the spring sunshine be follow by the glare of summer and all the tree in the boulevard have long since be in full leaf and the leave be cover with dust but they do not go back to vozdvizhenskoe as they have arrange to do long before they go on stay in moscow though they both loathe it because of late there have be no agreement between they the irritability that keep they apart have no external cause and all effort to come to an understanding intensify it instead of remove it it be an inner irritation ground in her mind on the conviction that his love have grow less in his on regret that he have put himself for her sake in a difficult position which she instead of lightening make still more difficult neither of they give full utterance to their sense of grievance but they consider each other in the wrong and try on every pretext to prove this to one another in her eye the whole of he with all his habit idea desire with all his spiritual and physical temperament be one thing — love for woman and that love she feel ought to be entirely concentrate on she alone that love be less consequently as she reason he must have transfer part of his love to other woman or to another woman — and she be jealous she be jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love not have get an object for her jealousy she be on the lookout for it at the slight hint she transfer her jealousy from one object to another at one time she be jealous of those low woman with whom he might so easily renew his old bachelor tie then she be jealous of the society woman he might meet then she be jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to marry for whose sake he would break with she and this last form of jealousy torture she most of all especially as he have unwarily tell she in a moment of frankness that his mother know he so little that she have have the audacity to try and persuade he to marry the young princess sorokina and be jealous of he anna be indignant against he and find ground for indignation in everything for everything that be difficult in her position she blame he the agonizing condition of suspense she have pass in moscow the tardiness and indecision of alexey alexandrovitch her solitude — she put it all down to he if he have love she he would have see all the bitterness of her position and would have rescue she from it for she be in moscow and not in the country he be to blame too he could not live bury in the country as she would have like to do he must have society and he have put she in this awful position the bitterness of which he would not see and again it be his fault that she be forever separate from her son even the rare moment of tenderness that come from time to time do not soothe she in his tenderness now she see a shade of complacency of selfconfidence which have not be of old and which exasperate she it be dusk anna be alone and wait for he to come back from a bachelor dinner she walk up and down in his study the room where the noise from the street be least hear and think over every detail of their yesterday ’s quarrel go back from the wellremembere offensive word of the quarrel to what have be the ground of it she arrive at last at its origin for a long while she could hardly believe that their dissension have arise from a conversation so inoffensive of so little moment to either but so it actually have be it all arise from his laugh at the girl ' high school declare they be useless while she defend they he have speak slightingly of woman ’s education in general and have say that hannah anna ’s english protégée have not the slight need to know anything of physic this irritate anna she see in this a contemptuous reference to her occupation and she bethink she of a phrase to pay he back for the pain he have give she " I do not expect you to understand I my feeling as anyone who love I might but simple delicacy I do expect " she say and he have actually flush with vexation and have say something unpleasant she could not recall her answer but at that point with an unmistakable desire to wound she too he have say " I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl that ’ true because I see it ’ unnatural " the cruelty with which he shatter the world she have build up for herself so laboriously to enable she to endure her hard life the injustice with which he have accuse she of affectation of artificiality arouse she " I be very sorry that nothing but what ’ coarse and material be comprehensible and natural to you " she say and walk out of the room when he have come in to she yesterday evening they have not refer to the quarrel but both feel that the quarrel have be smooth over but be not at an end today he have not be at home all day and she feel so lonely and wretched in be on bad term with he that she want to forget it all to forgive he and be reconcile with he she want to throw the blame on herself and to justify he " I be myself to blame I ’m irritable I ’m insanely jealous I will make it up with he and we ’ll go away to the country there I shall be more at peace " " unnatural " she suddenly recall the word that have sting she most of all not so much the word itself as the intent to wound she with which it be say " I know what he mean he mean — unnatural not love my own daughter to love another person ’s child what do he know of love for child of my love for seryozha whom I ’ve sacrifice for he but that wish to wound I no he love another woman it must be so " and perceive that while try to regain her peace of mind she have go round the same circle that she have be round so often before and have come back to her former state of exasperation she be horrified at herself " can it be impossible can it be beyond I to control myself " she say to herself and begin again from the beginning " he ’ truthful he ’ honest he love I I love he and in a few day the divorce will come what more do I want I want peace of mind and trust and I will take the blame on myself yes now when he come in I will tell he I be wrong though I be not wrong and we will go away tomorrow " and to escape think any more and be overcome by irritability she rang and order the box to be bring up for pack their thing for the country at ten o’clock vronsky come in " well be it nice " she ask come out to meet he with a penitent and meek expression " just as usual " he answer see at a glance that she be in one of her good mood he be use by now to these transition and he be particularly glad to see it today as he be in a specially good humor himself " what do I see come that ’ good " he say point to the box in the passage " yes we must go I go out for a drive and it be so fine I long to be in the country there ’ nothing to keep you be there " " it ’ the one thing I desire I ’ll be back directly and we ’ll talk it over I only want to change my coat order some tea " and he go into his room there be something mortifying in the way he have say " come that ’ good " as one say to a child when it leave off be naughty and still more mortifying be the contrast between her penitent and his selfconfident tone and for one instant she feel the lust of strife rise up in she again but make an effort she conquer it and meet vronsky as goodhumoredly as before when he come in she tell he partly repeat phrase she have prepare beforehand how she have spend the day and her plan for go away " you know it come to I almost like an inspiration " she say " why wait here for the divorce will not it be just the same in the country I can not wait any long I do not want to go on hope I do not want to hear anything about the divorce I have make up my mind it shall not have any more influence on my life do you agree " " oh yes " he say glance uneasily at her excited face " what do you do who be there " she say after a pause vronsky mention the name of the guest " the dinner be first rate and the boat race and it be all pleasant enough but in moscow they can never do anything without something ridicule a lady of a sort appear on the scene teacher of swimming to the queen of sweden and give we an exhibition of her skill " " how do she swim " ask anna frown " in an absurd red costume de natation she be old and hideous too so when shall we go " " what an absurd fancy why do she swim in some special way then " say anna not answer " there be absolutely nothing in it that ’ just what I say it be awfully stupid well then when do you think of go " anna shake her head as though try to drive away some unpleasant idea " when why the soon the well by tomorrow we shall not be ready the day after tomorrow " " yes   oh no wait a minute the day after tomorrow ’s sunday I have to be at maman ’s " say vronsky embarrassed because as soon as he utter his mother ’s name he be aware of her intent suspicious eye his embarrassment confirm her suspicion she flush hotly and draw away from he it be now not the queen of sweden ’s swimmingmistress who fill anna ’s imagination but the young princess sorokina she be stay in a village near moscow with countess vronskaya " can not you go tomorrow " she say " well no the deed and the money for the business I ’m go there for I can not get by tomorrow " he answer " if so we will not go at all " " but why so " " I shall not go later monday or never " " what for " say vronsky as though in amazement " why there ’ no meaning in it " " there ’ no meaning in it to you because you care nothing for I you do not care to understand my life the one thing that I care for here be hannah you say it ’ affectation why you say yesterday that I do not love my daughter that I love this english girl that it ’ unnatural I should like to know what life there be for I that could be natural " for an instant she have a clear vision of what she be do and be horrified at how she have fall away from her resolution but even though she know it be her own ruin she could not restrain herself could not keep herself from prove to he that he be wrong could not give way to he " I never say that I say I do not sympathize with this sudden passion " " how be it though you boast of your straightforwardness you do not tell the truth " " I never boast and I never tell lie " he say slowly restrain his rise anger " it ’ a great pity if you can not respect " " respect be invent to cover the empty place where love should be and if you do not love I any more it would be well and more honest to say so " " no this be become unbearable " cry vronsky get up from his chair and stop short face she he say speak deliberately " what do you try my patience for " look as though he might have say much more but be restrain himself " it have limit " " what do you mean by that " she cry look with terror at the undisguised hatred in his whole face and especially in his cruel menacing eye " I mean to say " he be begin but he check himself " I must ask what it be you want of I " " what can I want all I can want be that you should not desert I as you think of do " she say understand all he have not utter " but that I do not want that ’ secondary I want love and there be none so then all be over " she turn towards the door " stop stoop " say vronsky with no change in the gloomy line of his brow though he hold she by the hand " what be it all about I say that we must put off go for three day and on that you tell I I be lie that I be not an honorable man " " yes and I repeat that the man who reproach I with have sacrifice everything for I " she say recall the word of a still early quarrel " that he ’ bad than a dishonorable man — he ’ a heartless man " " oh there be limit to endurance " he cry and hastily let go her hand " he hate I that ’ clear " she think and in silence without look round she walk with faltering step out of the room " he love another woman that ’ even clear " she say to herself as she go into her own room " I want love and there be none so then all be over " she repeat the word she have say " and it must be end " " but how " she ask herself and she sit down in a low chair before the lookingglass thought of where she would go now whether to the aunt who have bring she up to dolly or simply alone abroad and of what he be do now alone in his study whether this be the final quarrel or whether reconciliation be still possible and of what all her old friend at petersburg would say of she now and of how alexey alexandrovitch would look at it and many other idea of what would happen now after this rupture come into her head but she do not give herself up to they with all her heart at the bottom of her heart be some obscure idea that alone interest she but she could not get clear sight of it think once more of alexey alexandrovitch she recall the time of her illness after her confinement and the feeling which never leave she at that time " why do not I die " and the word and the feeling of that time come back to she and all at once she know what be in her soul yes it be that idea which alone solve all " yes to die and the shame and disgrace of alexey alexandrovitch and of seryozha and my awful shame it will all be save by death to die and he will feel remorse will be sorry will love I he will suffer on my account " with the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sit down in the armchair take off and put on the ring on her left hand vividly picture from different side his feeling after her death approach footstep — his step — distract her attention as though absorb in the arrangement of her ring she do not even turn to he he go up to she and take she by the hand say softly " anna we ’ll go the day after tomorrow if you like I agree to everything " she do not speak " what be it " he urge " you know " she say and at the same instant unable to restrain herself any long she burst into sob " cast I off " she articulate between her sob " I ’ll go away tomorrow   I ’ll do more what be I an immoral woman a stone round your neck I do not want to make you wretched I do not want to I ’ll set you free you do not love I you love someone else " vronsky beseech she to be calm and declare that there be no trace of foundation for her jealousy that he have never cease and never would cease to love she that he love she more than ever " anna why distress yourself and I so " he say to she kiss her hand there be tenderness now in his face and she fancy she catch the sound of tear in his voice and she feel they wet on her hand and instantly anna ’s despairing jealousy change to a despairing passion of tenderness she put her arm round he and cover with kiss his head his neck his hand feel that the reconciliation be complete anna set eagerly to work in the morne prepare for their departure though it be not settle whether they should go on monday or tuesday as they have each give way to the other anna pack busily feel absolutely indifferent whether they go a day early or later she be stand in her room over an open box take thing out of it when he come in to see she early than usual dress to go out " I ’m go off at once to see maman she can send I the money by yegorov and I shall be ready to go tomorrow " he say though she be in such a good mood the thought of his visit to his mother ’s give she a pang " no I shall not be ready by then myself " she say and at once reflect " so then it be possible to arrange to do as I wish " " no do as you mean to do go into the diningroom I ’m come directly it ’ only to turn out those thing that be not want " she say put something more on the heap of frippery that lie in annushka ’s arm vronsky be eat his beefsteak when she come into the diningroom " you would not believe how distasteful these room have become to I " she say sit down beside he to her coffee " there ’ nothing more awful than these chambres garnie there ’ no individuality in they no soul these clock and curtain and bad of all the

to find out more and go to his own room so then everything be over and death rise clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of bring back love for she in his heart of punish he and of gain the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her heart be wage with he now nothing matter go or not go to vozdvizhenskoe get or not get a divorce from her husband — all that do not matter the one thing that matter be punish he when she pour herself out her usual dose of opium and think that she have only to drink off the whole bottle to die it seem to she so simple and easy that she begin muse with enjoyment on how he would suffer and repent and love her memory when it would be too late she lie in bed with open eye by the light of a single burneddown candle gaze at the carved cornice of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that cover part of it while she vividly picture to herself how he would feel when she would be no more when she would be only a memory to he " how could I say such cruel thing to she " he would say " how could I go out of the room without say anything to she but now she be no more she have go away from we forever she be " suddenly the shadow of the screen waver pounce on the whole cornice the whole ceiling other shadow from the other side swoop to meet it for an instant the shadow flit back but then with fresh swiftness they dart forward waver commingle and all be darkness " death " she think and such horror come upon she that for a long while she could not realize where she be and for a long while her tremble hand could not find the match and light another candle instead of the one that have burn down and go out " no anything — only to live why I love he why he love I this have be before and will pass " she say feel that tear of joy at the return to life be trickle down her cheek and to escape from her panic she go hurriedly to his room he be asleep there and sleep soundly she go up to he and hold the light above his face she gaze a long while at he now when he be asleep she love he so that at the sight of he she could not keep back tear of tenderness but she know that if he wake up he would look at she with cold eye convinced that he be right and that before tell he of her love she would have to prove to he that he have be wrong in his treatment of she without wake he she go back and after a second dose of opium she fall towards morning into a heavy incomplete sleep during which she never quite lose consciousness in the morning she be wake by a horrible nightmare which have recur several time in her

carriage " where to " ask pyotr before get onto the box " to znamenka the oblonskys ' " it be bright and sunny a fine rain have be fall all the morning and now it have not long clear up the iron roof the flag of the road the flint of the pavement the wheel and leather the brass and the tinplate of the carriage — all glisten brightly in the may sunshine it be three o’clock and the very lively time in the street as she sit in a corner of the comfortable carriage that hardly sway on its supple spring while the gray trot swiftly in the midst of the unceasing rattle of wheel and the change impression in the pure air anna run over the event of the last day and she see her position quite differently from how it have seem at home now the thought of death seem no long so terrible and so clear to she and death itself no long seem so inevitable now she blame herself for the humiliation to which she have lower herself " I entreat he to forgive I I have give in to he I have own myself in fault what for can not I live without he " and leave unanswered the question how she be go to live without he she fall to read the sign on the shop " office and warehouse dental surgeon yes I ’ll tell

bun shop they say they send their dough to petersburg the moscow water be so good for it ah the spring at mitishtchen and the pancake " and she remember how long long ago when she be a girl of seventeen she have go with her aunt to troitsa " ride too be that really I with red hand how much that seem to I then splendid and out of reach have become worthless while what I have then have go out of my reach forever could I ever have believe then that I could come to such humiliation how conceited and selfsatisfied he will be when he get my note but I will show he how horrid that paint smell why be it they ’re always paint and build mode et robes she read a man bow to she it be annushka ’s husband " our parasite " she remember how vronsky have say that " our why our what ’ so awful be that one can not tear up the past by its root one can not tear it out but one can hide one ’s memory of it and I ’ll hide it " and then she think of her past with alexey alexandrovitch of how she have blot the memory of it out of her life " dolly will think I ’m leave my second husband and so I certainly must be in the wrong as if I care to be right I can not help it " she say and she want to cry but at once she fall to wonder what those two girl could be smile about " love most likely they do not know how dreary it be how low the boulevard and the child three boy run play at horse seryozha and I ’m lose everything and not get he back yes I ’m lose everything if he do not return perhaps he be late for the train and have come back by now long for humiliation again " she say to herself " no I ’ll go to dolly and say straight out to she I ’m unhappy I deserve this I ’m to blame but still I ’m unhappy help I these horse this carriage — how loathsome I be to myself in this carriage — all his but I will not see they again " think over the word in which she would tell dolly and mentally work her heart up to great bitterness anna go upstairs " be there anyone with she " she ask in the hall " katerina alexandrovna levin " answer the footman " kitty kitty whom vronsky be in love with " think anna " the girl he think of with love he ’ sorry he do not marry she but I he think of with

quite what alexey alexandrovitch want but he will not go away without a decisive answer " " I think you have someone with you can I see the letter " " yes kitty " say dolly embarrassed " she stay in the nursery she have be very ill " " so I hear may I see the letter " " I ’ll get it directly but he do not refuse on the contrary stiva have hope " say dolly stop in the doorway " I have not and indeed I do not wish it " say anna " what ’ this do kitty consider it degrade to meet I " think anna when she be alone " perhaps she ’ right too but it ’ not for she the girl who be in love with vronsky it ’ not for she to show I that even if it be true I know that in my position I can not be receive by any decent woman I know that from the first moment I sacrifice everything to he and this be my reward oh how I hate he and what do I come here for I ’m bad here more miserable " she hear from the next room the sister ' voice in consultation " and what be I go to say to dolly now amuse kitty by the sight of my wretchedness submit to she patronize no and besides dolly would not understand and it would be no good my tell she it would only be interesting to see kitty to show she how I despise everyone and everything how nothing matter to I now " dolly come in with the letter anna read it and hand it back in silence " I know all that " she say " and it do not interest I in the least " " oh why so on the contrary I have hope " say dolly look inquisitively at anna she have never see she in such a strangely irritable condition " when be you go away " she ask anna halfclose her eye look straight before she and do not answer " why do kitty shrink from I " she say look at the door and flush red " oh what nonsense she ’ nurse and thing be not go right with she and I ’ve be advise she she ’ delighted she ’ll be here in a minute " say dolly awkwardly not clever at lie " yes here she be " hear that anna have call kitty have want not to appear but dolly persuade she rally her force kitty go in walk up to she blush and shake hand " I be so glad to see you " she say with a trembling voice kitty have be throw into confusion by the inward conflict between her antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to she but as soon as she see anna ’s lovely and attractive face all feeling of antagonism disappear " I should not have be surprised if you have not care to meet I I ’m used to everything you have be ill yes you be change " say anna kitty feel that anna be look at she with hostile eye she ascribe this hostility to the awkward position in which anna who have once patronize she must feel with she now and she feel sorry for she they talk of kitty ’s illness of the baby of stiva but it be obvious that nothing interest anna   " I come to say goodbye to you " she say get up   " oh when be you go "   but again not answer anna turn to kitty   " yes I be very glad to have see you " she say with a smile " I have hear so much of you from everyone even from your husband he come to see I and I like he exceedingly " she say unmistakably with malicious intent " where be he "   " he have go back to the country " say kitty blush   " remember I to he be sure you do "   " I ’ll be sure to " kitty say naïvely look compassionately into her eye   " so goodbye dolly " and kiss dolly and shake hand with kitty anna go out hurriedly   " she ’ just the same and just as charming she ’ very lovely " say kitty when she be alone with her sister " but there ’ something piteous about she awfully piteous "   " yes there ’ something unusual about she today " say dolly " when I go with she into the hall I fancy she be almost cry "     anna get into the carriage again in an even bad frame of mind than when she set out from home to her previous torture be add now that sense of mortification and of be an outcast which she have feel so distinctly on meet kitty   " where to home " ask pyotr   " yes home " she say not even think now where she be go   " how they look at I as something dreadful incomprehensible and curious what can he be tell the other with such warmth " she think stare at two man who walk by " can one ever tell anyone what one be feel I mean to tell dolly and it ’ a good thing I do not tell she how pleased she would have be at my misery she would have conceal it but her chief feeling would have be delight at my be punish for the happiness she envy I for kitty she would have be even more pleased how I can see through she she know I be more than usually sweet to her husband and she ’ jealous and hate I and she despise I in her eye I ’m an immoral woman if I be an immoral woman I could have make her husband fall in love with I   if I ’d care to and indeed I do care to there ’ someone who ’ pleased with himself " she think as she see a fat rubicund gentleman come towards she he take she for an acquaintance and lift his glossy hat above his bald glossy head and then perceive his mistake " he think he know I well he know I as well as anyone in the world know I I do not know myself I know my appetite as the french say they want that dirty ice cream that they do know for certain " she think look at two boy stop an ice cream seller who take a barrel off his head and begin wipe his perspire face with a towel " we all want what be sweet and nice if not sweetmeats then a dirty ice and kitty ’ the same — if not vronsky then levin and she envy I and hate I and we all hate each other I kitty kitty I yes that ’ the truth ' tiutkin coiffeur ' je me fais coiffer par tiutkin I ’ll tell he that when he come " she think and smile but the same instant she remember that she have no one now to tell anything amusing to " and there ’ nothing amusing nothing mirthful really it ’ all hateful they ’re singe for vesper and how carefully that merchant cross himself as if he be afraid of miss something why these church and this singing and this humbug simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab driver who be abuse each other so angrily yashvin say ' he want to strip I of my shirt and I he of his ' yes that ’ the truth "   she be plunge in these thought which so engross she that she leave off think of her own position when the carriage draw up at the step of her house it be only when she see the porter run out to meet she that she remember she have send the note and the telegram   " be there an answer " she inquire   " I ’ll see this minute " answer the porter and glance into his room he take out and give she the thin square envelope of a telegram " I can not come before ten o’clock — vronsky " she read   " and have not the messenger come back "   " no " answer the porter   " then since it ’ so I know what I must do " she say and feel a vague fury and craving for revenge rise up within she she run upstairs " I ’ll go to he myself before go away forever I ’ll tell he all never have I hate anyone as I hate that man " she think see his hat on the rack she shudder with aversion she do not consider that his telegram be an answer to her telegram and that he have not yet receive her note she picture he to herself as talk calmly to his mother and princess sorokina and rejoice at her suffering " yes I must go quickly " she say not know yet where she be go she long to get away as quickly as possible from the feeling she have go through in that awful house the servant the wall the thing in that house — all arouse repulsion and hatred in she and lie like a weight upon she   " yes I must go to the railway station and if he ’ not there then go there and catch he " anna look at the railway timetable in the newspaper an evening train go at two minute past eight " yes I shall be in time " she give order for the other horse to be put in the carriage and pack in a travelingbag the thing need for a few day she know she would never come back here again   among the plan that come into her head she vaguely determine that after what would happen at the station or at the countess ’s house she would go as far as the first town on the nizhni road and stop there   dinner be on the table she go up but the smell of the bread and cheese be enough to make she feel that all food be disgusting she order the carriage and go out the house throw a shadow now right across the street but it be a bright evening and still warm in the sunshine annushka who come down with her thing and pyotr who put the thing in the carriage and the coachman evidently out of humor be all hateful to she and irritate she by their word and action   " I do not want you pyotr "   " but how about the ticket "   " well as you like it do not matter " she say crossly   pyotr jump on the box and put his arm akimbo tell the coachman to drive to the bookingoffice     " here it be again again I understand it all " anna say to herself as soon as the carriage have start and sway lightly rumble over the tiny cobble of the paved road and again one impression follow rapidly upon another   " yes what be the last thing I think of so clearly " she try to recall it " ' tiutkin coiffeur’—no not that yes of what yashvin say the struggle for existence and hatred be the one thing that hold man together no it ’ a useless journey you ’re make " she say mentally address a party in a coach and four evidently go for an excursion into the country " and the dog you ’re take with you will be no help to you you can not get away from yourself " turn her eye in the direction pyotr have turn to look she see a factoryhand almost deaddrunk with hang head be lead away by a policeman " come he ’ find a quick way " she think " count vronsky and I do not find that happiness either though we expect so much from it " and now for the first time anna turn that glaring light in which she be see everything on to her relation with he which she have hitherto avoid think about " what be it he seek in I not love so much as the satisfaction of vanity " she remember his word the expression of his face that recall an abject setterdog in the early day of their connection and everything now confirm this " yes there be the triumph of success in he of course there be love too but the chief element be the pride of success he boast of I now that ’ over there ’ nothing to be proud of not to be proud of but to be ashamed of he have take from I all he could and now I be no use to he he be weary of I and be try not to be dishonorable in his behavior to I he let that out yesterday — he want divorce and marriage so as to burn his ship he love I but how the zest be go as the english say that fellow want everyone to admire he and be very much pleased with himself " she think look at a redfaced clerk ride on a ridingschool horse " yes there ’ not the same flavor about I for he now if I go away from he at the bottom of his heart he will be glad "   this be not mere supposition she see it distinctly in the pierce light which reveal to she now the meaning of life and human relation   " my love keep grow more passionate and egoistic while his be wane and wane and that ’ why we ’re drift apart " she go on muse " and there ’ no help for it he be everything for I and I want he more and more to give himself up to I entirely and he want more and more to get away from I we walk to meet each other up to the time of our love and then we have be irresistibly drift in different direction and there ’ no altering that he tell I I ’m insanely jealous and I have tell myself that I be insanely jealous but it ’ not true I ’m not jealous but I ’m unsatisfied but " she open her lip and shift her place in the carriage in the excitement arouse by the thought that suddenly strike she " if I could be anything but a mistress passionately care for nothing but his caress but I can not and I do not care to be anything else and by that desire I rouse aversion in he and he rouse fury in I and it can not be different do not I know that he would not deceive I that he have no scheme about princess sorokina that he ’ not in love with kitty that he will not desert I I know all that but it make it no well for I if without love I from duty he ’ll be good and kind to I without what I want that ’ a thousand time bad than unkindness that’ — hell and that ’ just how it be for a long while now he have not love I and where love end hate begin I do not know these street at all hill it seem and still house and house and in the house always people and people how many of they no end and all hate each other come let I try and think what I want to make I happy well suppose I be divorce and alexey alexandrovitch let I have seryozha and I marry vronsky " think of alexey alexandrovitch she at once picture he with extraordinary vividness as though he be alive before she with his mild lifeless dull eye the blue vein in his white hand his intonation and the cracking of his finger and remember the feeling which have exist between they and which be also call love she shudder with loathing " well I ’m divorce and become vronsky ’s wife well will kitty cease look at I as she look at I today no and will seryozha leave off ask and wonder about my two husband and be there any new feeling I can awaken between vronsky and I be there possible if not happiness some sort of ease from misery no no " she answer now without the slight hesitation " impossible we be draw apart by life and I make his unhappiness and he mine and there ’ no alter he or I every attempt have be make the screw have come unscrewed oh a beggar woman with a baby she think I ’m sorry for she be not we all fling into the world only to hate each other and so to torture ourselves and each other schoolboy come — laugh seryozha " she think " I think too that I love he and use to be touch by my own tenderness but I have live without he I give he up for another love and do not regret the exchange till that love be satisfy " and with loathing she think of what she mean by that love and the clearness with which she see life now her own and all man ’s be a pleasure to she " it ’ so with I and pyotr and the coachman fyodor and that merchant and all the people live along the volga where those placard invite one to go and everywhere and always " she think when she have drive under the lowpitched roof of the nizhigorod station and the porter run to meet she   " a ticket to obiralovka " say pyotr   she have utterly forget where and why she be go and only by a great effort she understand the question   " yes " she say hand he her purse and take a little red bag in her hand she get out of the carriage   make her way through the crowd to the firstclass waitingroom she gradually recollect all the detail of her position and the plan between which she be hesitate and again at the old sore place hope and then despair poison the wound of her torture fearfully throb heart as she sit on the starshaped sofa wait for the train she gaze with aversion at the people come and go they be all hateful to she and think how she would arrive at the station would write he a note and what she would write to he and how he be at this moment complain to his mother of his position not understand her suffering and how she would go into the room and what she would say to he then she think that life might still be happy and how miserably she love and hate he and how fearfully her heart be beat     a bell ring some young man ugly and impudent and at the same time careful of the impression they be make hurry by pyotr too cross the room in his livery and topboot with his dull animal face and come up to she to take she to the train some noisy man be quiet as she pass they on the platform and one whisper something about she to another — something vile no doubt she step up on the high step and sit down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that have be white her bag lie beside she shake up and down by the springiness of the seat with a foolish smile pyotr raise his hat with its colored band at the window in token of farewell an impudent conductor slam the door and the latch a grotesquelooking lady wear a bustle anna mentally undress the woman and be appal at her hideousness and a little girl laugh affectedly run down the platform   " katerina andreevna she ’ get they all ma tante " cry the girl   " even the child ’s hideous and affected " think anna to avoid see anyone she get up quickly and seat herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage a misshapenlooking peasant cover with dirt in a cap from which his tangled hair stick out all round pass by that window stoop down to the carriage wheel " there ’ something familiar about that hideous peasant " think anna and remember her dream she move away to the opposite door shake with terror the conductor open the door and let in a man and his wife   " do you wish to get out "   anna make no answer the conductor and her two fellowpassenger do not notice under her veil her panicstricken face she go back to her corner and sit down the couple seat themselves on the opposite side and intently but surreptitiously scrutinize her clothe both husband and wife seem repulsive to anna the husband ask would she allow he to smoke obviously not with a view to smoking but to get into conversation with she receive her assent he say to his wife in french something about care less to smoke than to talk they make inane and affected remark to one another entirely for her benefit anna see clearly that they be sick of each other and hate each other and no one could have help hate such miserable monstrosity   a second bell sound and be follow by moving of luggage noise shouting and laughter it be so clear to anna that there be nothing for anyone to be glad of that this laughter irritate she agonizingly and she would have like to stop up her ear not to hear it at last the third bell ring there be a whistle and a hiss of steam and a clank of chain and the man in her carriage cross himself " it would be interesting to ask he what meaning he attach to that " think anna look angrily at he she look past the lady out of the window at the people who seem whirl by as they run beside the train or stand on the platform the train jerk at regular interval at the junction of the rail roll by the platform past a stone wall a signalbox past other train the wheel move more smoothly and evenly resound with a slight clang on the rail the window be light up by the bright evening sun and a slight breeze flutter the curtain anna forget her fellow passenger and to the light swaying of the train she fall to think again as she breathe the fresh air   " yes what do I stop at that I could not conceive a position in which life would not be a misery that we be all create to be miserable and that we all know it and all invent mean of deceive each other and when one see the truth what be one to do "   " that ’ what reason be give man for to escape from what worry he " say the lady in french lisp affectedly and obviously pleased with her phrase   the word seem an answer to anna ’s thought   " to escape from what worry he " repeat anna and glance at the redcheeked husband and the thin wife she see that the sickly wife consider herself misunderstand and the husband deceive she and encourage she in that idea of herself anna seem to see all their history and all the cranny of their soul as it be turn a light upon they but there be nothing interesting in they and she pursue her thought   " yes I ’m very much worried and that ’ what reason be give I for to escape so then one must escape why not put out the light when there ’ nothing more to look at when it ’ sickening to look at it all but how why do the conductor run along the footboard why be they shriek those young man in that train why be they talk why be they laugh it ’ all falsehood all you all humbug all cruelty "   when the train come into the station anna get out into the crowd of passenger and move apart from they as if they be leper she stand on the platform try to think what she have come here for and what she mean to do everything that have seem to she possible before be now so difficult to consider especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave she alone one moment porter run up to she proffer their service then young man clack their heel on the plank of the platform and talk loudly stare at her people meet she dodge past on the wrong side remember that she have mean to go on far if there be no answer she stop a porter and ask if her coachman be not here with a note from count vronsky   " count vronsky they send up here from the vronskys just this minute to meet princess sorokina and her daughter and what be the coachman like "   just as she be talk to the porter the coachman mihail red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain evidently proud of having so successfully perform his commission come up to she and give she a letter she break it open and her heart ache before she have read it   " I be very sorry your note do not reach I I will be home at ten " vronsky have write carelessly   " yes that ’ what I expect " she say to herself with an evil smile   " very good you can go home then " she say softly address mihail she speak softly because the rapidity of her heart ’s beating hinder she breathing " no I will not let you make I miserable " she think menacingly address not he not herself but the power that make she suffer and she walk along the platform   two maidservant walk along the platform turn their head stare at she and make some remark about her dress " real " they say of the lace she be wear the young man would not leave she in peace again they pass by peer into her face and with a laugh shout something in an unnatural voice the stationmaster come up ask she whether she be go by train a boy sell kva never take his eye off she " my god where be I to go " she think go far and far along the platform at the end she stop some lady and child who have come to meet a gentleman in spectacle pause in their loud laughter and talk and stare at she as she reach they she quicken her pace and walk away from they to the edge of the platform a luggage train be come in the platform begin to sway and she fancy she be in the train again   and all at once she think of the man crush by the train the day she have first meet vronsky and she know what she have to do with a rapid light step she go down the step that lead from the tank to the rail and stop quite near the approach train   she look at the low part of the carriage at the screw and chain and the tall castiron wheel of the first carriage slowly move up and try to measure the middle between the front and back wheel and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite she   " there " she say to herself look into the shadow of the carriage at the sand and coal dust which cover the sleepers—“there in the very middle and I will punish he and escape from everyone and from myself "   she try to fling herself below the wheel of the first carriage as it reach she but the red bag which she try to drop out of her hand delay she and she be too late she miss the moment she have to wait for the next carriage a feeling such as she have know when about to take the first plunge in bathing come upon she and she cross herself that familiar gesture bring back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memory and suddenly the darkness that have cover everything for she be tear apart and life rise up before she for an instant with all its bright past joy but she do not take her eye from the wheel of the second carriage and exactly at the moment when the space between the wheel come opposite she she drop the red bag and draw her head back into her shoulder fall on her hand under the carriage and lightly as though she would rise again at once drop on to her knee and at the same instant she be terrorstricken at what she be do " where be I what be I do what for " she try to get up to drop backwards but something huge and merciless strike she on the head and roll she on her back " lord forgive I all " she say feel it impossible to struggle a peasant mutter something be work at the iron above she and the light by which she have read the book fill with trouble falsehood sorrow and evil flare up more brightly than ever before light up for she all that have be in darkness flicker begin to grow dim and be quench forever
