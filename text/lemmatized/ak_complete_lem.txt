woman no long young or goodlooking and in no way remarkable or interesting merely a good mother ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view it have turn out quite the other way " oh it ’

be go away let he do — that be you — as he like " he say laugh only with his eye and put his hand in his pocket he watch his master with his head on one side stepan arkadyevitch be silent a minute then a goodhumored and rather pitiful smile show itself on his handsome face " eh matvey " he say shake his head " it ’ all right sir she will come round " say matvey " come round " " yes sir " " do you think so who ’ there " ask stepan arkadyevitch hear the rustle of a woman ’s dress at the door " it ’ I " say a firm pleasant woman ’s voice and the stern pockmarked face of matrona philimonovna the nurse be thrust in at the doorway " well what be it matrona " query stepan arkadyevitch go up to she at the door although stepan arkadyevitch be completely in the wrong as regard his wife and be conscious of this himself almost everyone in the house even the nurse darya alexandrovna ’s chief ally be on his side " well what now " he ask disconsolately " go to she sir own your fault again maybe god will aid you she be suffer so it ’ sad to see she and besides everything in the house be topsyturvy you must have pity sir on the child beg her forgiveness sir there ’ no help for it one must take the consequence " " but she will not see I " " you do your part god be merciful pray to god sir pray to god " " come that ’ll do you can go " say stepan arkadyevitch blush suddenly " well now do dress I " he turn to matvey and throw off his dressinggown decisively matvey be already hold up the shirt like a horse ’s collar and blow off some invisible speck he slip it with obvious pleasure over the wellgroomed body of his master when he be dress stepan arkadyevitch sprinkle some scent on himself pull down his shirtcuff distribute into his pocket his cigarette pocketbook match and watch with its double chain and seal and shake out his handkerchief feel himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his unhappiness he walk with a slight swing on each leg into the diningroom where coffee be already wait for he and beside the coffee letter and paper from the office he read the letter one be very unpleasant from a merchant who be buy a forest on his wife ’s property to sell this forest be absolutely essential but at present until he be reconcile with his wife the subject could not be discuss the most unpleasant thing of all be that his pecuniary interest should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be lead on by his interest that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest — that idea hurt he when he have finish his letter stepan arkadyevitch move the officepaper close to he rapidly look through two piece of business make a few note with a big pencil and push away the paper turn to his coffee as he sip his coffee he open a still damp morning paper and begin read it stepan arkadyevitch take in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocate the view hold by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politic have no special interest for he he firmly hold those view on all these subject which be hold by the majority and by his paper and he only change they when the majority change they — or more strictly speak he do not change they but they imperceptibly change of themselves within he stepan arkadyevitch have not choose his political opinion or his view these political opinion and view have come to he of themselves just as he do not choose the shape of his hat and coat but simply take those that be be wear and for he live in a certain society — owe to the need ordinarily develop at year of discretion for some degree of mental activity — to have view be just as indispensable as to have a hat if there be a reason for his prefer liberal to conservative view which be hold also by many of his circle it arise not from his consider liberalism more rational but from its be in close accordance with his manner of life the liberal party say that in russia everything be wrong and certainly stepan arkadyevitch have many debt and be decidedly short of money the liberal party say that marriage be an institution quite out of date and that it need reconstruction and family life certainly afford stepan arkadyevitch little gratification and force he into lying and hypocrisy which be so repulsive to his nature the liberal party say or rather allow it to be understand that religion be only a curb to keep in check the barbarous class of the people and stepan arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his leg ache from stand up and could never make out what be the object of all the terrible and highflown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevitch who like a joke be fond of puzzle a plain man by say that if he pride himself on his origin he ought not to stop at rurik and disown the first founder of his family — the monkey and so liberalism have become a habit of stepan arkadyevitch ’s and he like his newspaper as he do his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffuse in his brain he read the leading article in which it be maintain that it be quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism be threaten to swallow up all conservative element and that the government ought to take measure to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary " in our opinion the danger lie not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clog progress " etc etc he read another article too a financial one which allude to bentham and mill and drop some innuendo reflect on the ministry with his characteristic quickwittedness he catch the drift of each innuendo divine whence it come at whom and on what ground it be aim and that afford he as it always do a certain satisfaction but today that satisfaction be embitter by matrona philimonovna ’s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household he read too that count beist be rumor to have leave for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seek a situation but these item of information do not give he as usual a quiet ironical gratification have finish the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he get up shake the crumb of the roll off his waistcoat and square his broad chest he smile joyously not because there be anything particularly agreeable in his mind — the joyous smile be evoke by a good digestion but this joyous smile at once recall everything to he and he grow thoughtful two childish voice stepan arkadyevitch recognize the voice of grisha his young boy and tanya his eld girl be hear outside the door they be carry something and drop it " I tell you not to sit passenger on the roof " say the little girl in english " there pick they up " " everything ’ in confusion " think stepan arkadyevitch "

say smile to the boy who have come up to greet he he be conscious that he love the boy less and always try to be fair but the boy feel it and do not respond with a smile to his father ’s chilly smile " mamma she be up " answer the girl stepan arkadyevitch sigh " that mean that she ’ not sleep again all night " he think " well be she cheerful " the little girl know that there be a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he be pretend when he ask about it so lightly and she blush for her father he at once perceive it and blush too " I do not know " she say " she do not say we must do our lesson but she say we be to go for a walk with miss hoole to grandmamma ’s " " well go tanya my darling oh wait a

must let you drink your coffee in peace at least " say matvey in the affectionately gruff tone with which it be impossible to be angry " well show the person up at once " say oblonsky frown with vexation the petitioner the widow of a staff captain kalinin come with a request impossible and unreasonable but stepan arkadyevitch as he generally do make she sit down hear she to the end attentively without interrupt she and give she detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply and even write she in his large sprawl good and legible hand a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to she have get rid of the staff captain ’s widow stepan arkadyevitch take his hat and stop to recollect whether he have forget anything it appear that he have forget nothing except what he want to forget — his wife " ah yes " he bow his head and his handsome face assume a harassed expression " to go or not to go " he say to himself and an inner voice tell he he must not go that nothing could come of it but falsity that to amend to set right their relation be impossible because it be impossible to make she attractive again and able to inspire love or to make he an old man not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now and deceit and lying be oppose to his nature " it must be some time though it can not go on like this " he say try to give himself courage he square his chest take out a cigarette take two whiff at it fling it into a motherofpearl ashtray and with rapid step walk through the drawingroom and open the other door into his wife ’s bedroom darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty once luxuriant and beautiful hair fasten up with hairpin on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eye which look prominent from the thinness of her face be stand among a litter of all sort of thing scatter all over the room before an open bureau from which she be take somethe hear her husband ’s step she stop look towards the door and try assiduously to give her feature a severe and contemptuous expression she feel she be afraid of he and afraid of the come interview she be just attempt to do what she have attempt to do ten time already in these last three day — to sort out the child ’s thing and her own so as to take they to her mother’s — and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she keep say to herself " that thing can not go on like this that she must take some step " to punish he put he to shame avenge on he some little part at least of the suffering he have cause she she still continue to tell herself that she should leave he but she be conscious that this be impossible it be impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regard he as her husband and love he besides this she realize that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five child properly they would be still bad off where she be go with they all as it be even in the course of these three day the young be unwell from be give unwholesome soup and the other have almost go without their dinner the day

scan his figure that beam with health and freshness " yes he be happy and content " she think " while I and that disgusting good nature which everyone like he for and praise — I hate that good nature of his " she think her mouth stiffen the muscle of the cheek contract on the right side of her pale nervous face " what do you want " she say in a rapid deep unnatural voice " dolly " he repeat with a quiver in his voice " anna be come today " " well what be that to I I can not see she " she cry " but you must really dolly " " go away go away go away " she shriek not look at he as though this shriek be call up by physical pain stepan arkadyevitch could be calm when he think of his wife he could hope that she would come round as matvey express it and could quietly go on read his paper and drink his coffee but when he see her tortured suffering face hear the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair there be a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat and his eye begin to shine with tear " my god what have I do dolly for god ’s sake you know " he could not go on there be a sob in his throat she shut the bureau with a slam and glance at he " dolly what can I say one thing forgive remember can not nine year of my life atone for an instant " she drop her eye and listen expect what he would say as it be beseech he in some way or other to make she believe differently

you come near I I will call in the servant the child they you all know you be a scoundrel I be go away at once and you may live here with your mistress " and she go out slam the door stepan arkadyevitch sigh wipe his face and with a subdued tread walk out of the room " matvey say she will come round but how I do not see the least chance of it ah oh how horrible it be and how vulgarly she shout " he say to himself remember her shriek and the words—“scoundrel " and " mistress " " and very likely the maid be listen horribly vulgar horrible " stepan arkadyevitch stand a few second alone

time she have be in the nursery the english governess and matrona philimonovna have succeed in put several question to she which do not admit of delay and which only she could answer " what be the child to put on for their walk should they have any milk should not a new cook be send for " " ah let I alone let I alone " she say and go back to her bedroom she sit down in the same place as she have sit when talk to her husband clasp tightly her thin hand with the ring that slip down on her bony finger and fall to go over in her you all the conversation " he have go but have he break it off with she " she think " can it be he see she why do not I ask he no no reconciliation be impossible even if we remain in the same house we be stranger — stranger forever " she repeat again with special

six again like yesterday " " very well I will come directly and see about it but do you send for some new milk " and darya alexandrovna plunge into the duty of the day and drown her grief in they for a time stepan arkadyevitch have learn easily at school thank to his excellent ability but he have be idle and mischievous and therefore be one of the low in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipate mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupy the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government board at moscow this post he have receive through his sister anna ’s husband alexey alexandrovitch karenin who hold one of the most important position in the ministry to whose department the moscow office belong but if karenin have not get his brotherinlaw this berth then through a hundred other personage — brother sister cousin uncle and aunt — stiva oblonsky would have receive this post or some other similar one together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for he as his affair in spite of his wife ’s considerable property be in an embarrassed condition half moscow and petersburg be friend and relation

know he in petticoat another third be his intimate chum and the remainder be friendly acquaintance consequently the distributor of earthly blessing in the shape of place rent share and such be all his friend and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky have no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he have only not to refuse thing not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never do it would have strike he as absurd if he have be tell that he would not get a position with the salary he require especially as he expect nothing out of the way he only want what the man of his own age and standing do get and he be no worse qualified for perform duty of the kind than any other man stepan arkadyevitch be not merely like you all who know he for his good humor but for his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in he in his handsome radiant figure his sparkle eye black hair and eyebrow and the white and red of his face there be something which produce a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who meet he " aha stiva oblonsky here he be " be almost always say with a smile of delight on meet he even though it happen at time that after a conversation with he it seem that nothing particularly delightful have happen the next day and the next everyone be just as delighted at meet he again after fill for three year the post of president of one of the government board at moscow stepan arkadyevitch have win the respect as well as the liking of his fellowofficial subordinate and superior and all who have have business with he the principal quality in stepan arkadyevitch which have gain he this universal respect in the service consist in the first place of his extreme indulgence for other found on a consciousness of his own shortcoming secondly of his perfect liberalism — not the liberalism he read of in the paper but the liberalism that be in his blood in virtue of which he treat all man perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or calling might be and thirdly — the most important point — his complete indifference to the business in which he be engage in consequence of which he be never carry away and never make mistake on reach the office of the board stepan arkadyevitch escort by a deferential porter with a portfolio go into his little private room put on his uniform and go into the boardroom the clerk and you all rise greet he with goodhumored deference stepan arkadyevitch move quickly as ever to his place shake hand with his colleague and sit down he make a joke or two and talk just as much as be consistent with due decorum and begin work no one know well than stepan arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom simplicity and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the goodhumored deference common to everyone in stepan arkadyevitch ’s office come up with paper and begin to speak in the familiar and easy tone which have be introduce by stepan arkadyevitch " we have succeed in get the information from the government department of penza here would you care " " you ’ve get they at last " say stepan arkadyevitch lay his finger on the paper " now gentleman " and the sitting of the board begin " if they know " he think bend his

without permission directly my back be turn he be ask for you I tell he when the member come out then " " where be he " " maybe he ’ go into the passage but here he come anyway that be he " say the doorkeeper point to a strongly build broadshouldered man with a curly beard who without take off his sheepskin cap be run lightly and rapidly up the worn step of the stone staircase one of the member go down — a lean official with a portfolio — stand out of his way and look disapprovingly at the leg of the stranger then glance inquiringly at oblonsky stepan arkadyevitch be stand at the top of the stair his goodnaturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beam more than ever when he recognize the man come up " why it ’ actually you levin at last " he say with a friendly mocking smile scan levin as he approach " how be it you have deign to look I up in this den " say stepan arkadyevitch and not content with shake hand he kiss his friend " have you be here long " " I have just come and very much want to see you " say levin look shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around " well let ’s go into my room " say stepan arkadyevitch who know his friend ’s sensitive and irritable shyness and take his arm he draw he along as though guide he through danger stepan arkadyevitch be on familiar term with almost all his acquaintance and call almost all of they by their christian name old man of sixty boy of twenty actor minister merchant and adjutantgeneral so that many of his intimate chum be to be find at the extreme end of the social ladder and would have be very much surprised to learn that they have through the medium of oblonsky something in common he be the familiar friend of everyone with whom he take a glass of champagne and he take a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he meet any of his disreputable chum as he use in joke to call many of his friend in the presence of his subordinate he well know how with his characteristic tact to diminish the disagreeable impression make on they levin be not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact feel that levin fancy he might not care to show his intimacy with he before his subordinate and so he make haste to take he off into his room levin be almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy do not rest merely on champagne levin have be the friend and companion of his early youth they be fond of one another in spite of the difference of their character and taste as friend be fond of one another who have be together in early youth but in spite of this each of they — as be often the way with man who have select career of different kind — though in discussion he would even justify the other ’s career in his heart despise it it seem to each of they that the life he lead himself be the only real life and the life lead by his friend be a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he have see he come up to moscow from the country where he be do something but what precisely stepan arkadyevitch could never quite make out and indeed he take no interest in the matter levin arrive in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of thing stepan arkadyevitch laugh at this and like it in the same way levin in his heart despise the town mode of life of his friend and his official duty which he laugh at and regard as trifling but the difference be that oblonsky as he be do the same as everyone do laugh complacently and goodhumoredly while levin laugh without complacency and sometimes angrily " we have long be expect you " say stepan arkadyevitch go into his room and let levin ’s hand go as though to show that here all danger be over " I be very very glad to see you " he go on " well how be you eh when do you come " levin be silent look at the unknown face of oblonsky ’s two companion and especially at the hand of the elegant grinevitch which have such long white finger such long yellow filbertshaped nail and such huge shining stud on the shirtcuff that apparently they absorb all his attention and allow he no freedom of thought oblonsky notice this at once and smile " ah to be sure let I introduce you " he say " my colleague philip ivanitch nikitin mihail stanislavitch grinevitch”—and turn to levin—“a district councilor a modern district councilman a gymnast who lift thirteen stone with one hand a cattlebreeder and sportsman and my friend konstantin dmitrievitch levin the brother of sergey ivanovitch koznishev " " delighted " say the veteran " I have the honor of know your brother sergey ivanovitch " say grinevitch hold out his slender hand with its long nail levin frown shake hand coldly and at once turn to oblonsky though he have a great respect for his halfbrother an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treat he not as konstantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev " no I be no long a district councilor I have quarrel with they all and do not go to the meeting any more " he say turn to oblonsky " you ’ve be quick about it " say oblonsky with a smile " but how why " " it ’ a long story I will tell you some time " say levin but he begin tell he at once " well to put it shortly I be convinced that nothing be really do by the district council or ever could be " he begin as though someone have just insult he " on one side it ’ a plaything they play at be a parliament and I ’m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in plaything and on the other side " he stammer " it ’ a means for the coterie of the district to make money formerly they have wardship court of justice now they have the district council — not in the form of bribe but in the form of unearned salary " he say as hotly as though someone of those present have oppose his opinion " aha you ’re in a new phase again I see — a conservative " say stepan arkadyevitch " however we can go into that later " " yes later but I want to see you " say levin look with hatred at grinevitch ’s hand stepan arkadyevitch give a scarcely perceptible smile " how be it you use to say you would never wear european dress again " he say scan his new suit obviously cut by a french tailor " ah I see a new phase " levin suddenly blush not as grown man blush slightly without be themselves aware of it but as boy blush feel that they be ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blush still more almost to the point of tear and it be so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky leave off look at he " oh where shall we meet you know I want very much to talk to you " say levin oblonsky seem to ponder " I ’ll tell you what let ’s go to gurin ’s to lunch and there we can talk I be free till three " " no " answer levin after an instant ’s thought " I have get to go on somewhere else " " all right then let ’s dine together " " dine together but I have nothing very particular only a few word to say and a question I want to ask you and we can have a talk afterwards " " well say the few word then at once and we ’ll gossip after dinner " " well it ’ this " say levin " but it ’ of no importance though " his face all at once take an expression of anger from the effort he be make to surmount his shyness " what be the shtcherbatskys do everything as it use to be " he say stepan arkadyevitch who have long know that levin be in love with his sisterinlaw kitty give a hardly perceptible smile and his eye sparkle merrily " you say a few word but I can not answer in a few word because excuse I a minute " a secretary come in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business he go up to oblonsky with some paper and begin under pretense of ask a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevitch without hear he out lay his hand genially on the secretary ’s sleeve " no you do as I tell you " he say soften his word with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turn away from the paper and say " so do it that way if you please zahar nikititch " the secretary retire in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin have completely recover from his embarrassment he be stand with his elbow on the back of a chair and on his face be a look of ironical attention " I do not understand it I do not understand it " he say " what do not you understand " say oblonsky smile as brightly as ever and pick up a cigarette he expect some queer outburst from levin " I do not understand what you be do " say levin shrug his shoulder " how can you do it seriously " " why not " " why because there ’ nothing in it " " you think so but we ’re overwhelmed with work " " on paper but there you ’ve a gift for it " add levin " that ’ to say you think there ’ a lack of something in I " " perhaps so " say levin " but all the same I admire your grandeur and be proud that I ’ve a friend in such a great person you ’ve not answer my question though " he go on with a desperate effort look oblonsky straight in the face " oh that ’ all very well you wait a bit and you ’ll come to this yourself it ’ very nice for you to have over six thousand acre in the karazinsky district and such muscle and the freshness of a girl of twelve still you ’ll be one of we one day yes as to your question there be no change but it ’ a pity you ’ve be away so long " " oh why so " levin query panicstricken " oh nothing " respond oblonsky " we ’ll talk it over but what ’ bring you up to town " " oh we ’ll talk about that too later on " say levin redden again up to his ear " all right I see " say stepan arkadyevitch " I should ask you to come to we you know but my wife ’ not quite the thing but I tell you what if you want to see they they ’re sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skate you drive along there and I ’ll come and fetch you and we ’ll go and dine somewhere together " " capital so goodbye till then " " now mind you ’ll forget I know you or rush off home to the country " stepan arkadyevitch call out laugh " no truly " and levin go out of the room only when he be in the doorway remember that he have forget to take leave of oblonsky ’s colleague " that gentleman must be a man of great energy " say grinevitch when levin have go away " yes my dear boy " say stepan arkadyevitch nod his head " he ’ a lucky fellow over six thousand acre in the karazinsky district everything before he and what youth and vigor not like some of we " " you have a great deal to complain of have not you stepan arkadyevitch " " ah yes I ’m in a poor way a bad way " say stepan arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh when oblonsky ask levin what have bring he to town levin blush and be furious with himself for blush because he could not answer " I have come to make your sisterinlaw an offer " though that be precisely what he have come for the family of the levins and the shtcherbatskys be old noble moscow family and have always be on intimate and friendly term this intimacy have grow still close during levin ’s student day he have both prepare for the university with the young prince shtcherbatsky the brother of kitty and dolly and have enter at the same time with he in those day levin use often to be in the shtcherbatskys ' house and he be in love with the shtcherbatsky household strange as it may appear it be with the household the family that konstantin levin be in love especially with the feminine half of the household levin do not remember his own mother and his only sister be old than he be so that it be in the shtcherbatskys ' house that he see for the first time that inner life of an old noble cultivated and honorable family of which he have be deprive by the death of his father and mother all the member of that family especially the feminine half be picture by he as it be wrap about with a mysterious poetical veil and he not only perceive no defect whatever in they but under the poetical veil that shroud they he assume the existence of the lofty sentiment and every possible perfection why it be the three young lady have one day to speak french and the next english why it be that at certain hour they play by turn on the piano the sound of which be audible in their brother ’s room above where the student use to work why they be visit by those professor of french literature of music of drawing of dancing why at certain hour all the three young lady with mademoiselle linon drive in the coach to the tversky boulevard dress in their satin cloak dolly in a long one natalia in a halflong one and kitty in one so short that her shapely leg in tightlydrawn red stocking be visible to all beholder why it be they have to walk about the tversky boulevard escort by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat — all this and much more that be do in their mysterious world he do not understand but he be sure that everything that be do there be very good and he be in love precisely with the mystery of the proceeding in his student day he have all but be in love with the eld dolly but she be soon marry to oblonsky then he begin be in love with the second he feel as it be that he have to be in love with one of the sister only he could not quite make out which but natalia too have hardly make her appearance in the world when she marry the diplomat lvov kitty be still a child when levin leave the university young shtcherbatsky go into the navy be drown in the baltic and levin ’s relation with the shtcherbatskys in spite of his friendship with oblonsky become less intimate but when early in the winter of this year levin come to moscow after a year in the country and see the shtcherbatskys he realize which of the three sister he be indeed destine to love one would have think that nothing could be simple than for he a man of good family rather rich than poor and thirtytwo year old to make the young princess shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage in all likelihood he would at once have be look upon as a good match but levin be in love and so it seem to he that kitty be so perfect in every respect that she be a creature far above everything earthly and that he be a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceive that other people and she herself could regard he as worthy of she after spend two month in moscow in a state of enchantment see kitty almost every day in society into which he go so as to meet she he abruptly decide that it could not be and go back to the country levin ’s conviction that it could not be be found on the idea that in the eye of her family he be a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming kitty and that kitty herself could not love he in her family ’s eye he have no ordinary definite career and position in society while his contemporary by this time when he be thirtytwo be already one a colonel and another a professor another director of a bank and railway or president of a board like oblonsky but he he know very well how he must appear to other be a country gentleman occupy in breed cattle shoot game and build barn in other word a fellow of no ability who have not turn out well and who be do just what accord to the idea of the world be do by people fit for nothing else the mysterious enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceive himself to be and above all such an ordinary in no way striking person moreover his attitude to kitty in the past — the attitude of a grownup person to a child arise from his friendship with her brother — seem to he yet another obstacle to love an ugly goodnatured man as he consider himself might he suppose be like as a friend but to be love with such a love as that with which he love kitty one would need to be a handsome and still more a distinguished man he have hear that woman often do care for ugly and ordinary man but he do not believe it for he judge by himself and he could not himself have love any but beautiful mysterious and exceptional woman but after spend two month alone in the country he be convince that this be not one of those passion of which he have have experience in his early youth that this feeling give he not an instant ’s rest that he could not live without decide the question would she or would she not be his wife and that his despair have arise only from his own imagining that he have no sort of proof that he would be reject and he have now come to moscow with a firm determination to make an offer and get marry if he be accept or   he could not conceive what would become of he if he be reject on arrive in moscow by a morning train levin have put up at the house of his elder halfbrother koznishev after change his clothe he go down to his brother ’s study intend to talk to he at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother be not alone with he there be a wellknown professor of philosophy who have come from harkov expressly to clear up a difference that have arise between they on a very important philosophical question the professor be carry on a hot crusade against materialist sergey koznishev have be follow this crusade with interest and after read the professor ’s last article he have write he a letter state his objection he accuse the professor of make too great concession to the materialist and the professor have promptly appear to argue the matter out the point in discussion be the question then in vogue be there a line to be draw between psychological and physiological phenomenon in man and if so where sergey ivanovitch meet his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always have for everyone and introduce he to the professor go on with the conversation a little man in spectacle with a narrow forehead tear himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then go on talk without pay any further attention to he levin sit down to wait till the professor should go but he soon begin to get interested in the subject under discussion levin have come across the magazine article about which they be dispute and have read they interested in they as a development of the first principle of science familiar to he as a natural science student at the university but he have never connect these scientific deduction as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those question as to the meaning of life and death to himself which have of late be more and more often in his mind as he listen to his brother ’s argument with the professor he notice that they connect these scientific question with those spiritual problem that at time they almost touch on the latter but every time they be close upon what seem to he the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunge again into a sea of subtle distinction reservation quotation allusion and appeal to authority and it be with difficulty that he understand what they be talk about " I can not admit it " say sergey ivanovitch with his habitual clearness precision of expression and elegance of phrase " I can not in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world have be derive from perception the most fundamental idea the idea of existence have not be receive by I through sensation indeed there be no special senseorgan for the transmission of such an idea " " yes but they — wurt and knaust and pripasov — would answer that your consciousness of existence be derive from the conjunction of all your sensation that that consciousness of existence be the result of your sensation wurt indeed say plainly that assume there be no sensation it follow that there be no idea of existence " " I maintain the contrary " begin sergey ivanovitch but here it seem to levin that just as they be close upon the real point of the matter they be again retreat and he make up his mind to put a question to the professor " accord to that if my sense be annihilate if my body be dead I can have no existence of any sort " he query the professor in annoyance and as it be mental suffering at the interruption look round at the strange inquirer more like a bargeman than a philosopher and turn his eye upon sergey ivanovitch as though to ask what ’ one to say to he but sergey ivanovitch who have be talk with far less heat and onesidedness than the professor and who have sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question be put smile and say " that question we have no right to answer as yet " " we have not the requisite datum " chime in the professor and he go back to his argument " no " he say " I would point out the fact that if as pripasov directly assert perception be base on sensation then we be bind to distinguish sharply between these two conception " levin listen no more and simply wait for the professor to go when the professor have go sergey ivanovitch turn to his brother " delighted that you ’ve come for some time be it how ’ your farming get on " levin know that his eld brother take little interest in farming and only put the question in deference to he and so he only tell he about the sale of his wheat and money matter levin have mean to tell his brother of his determination to get marry and to ask his advice he have indeed firmly resolve to do so but after see his brother listen to his conversation with the professor hear afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother question he about agricultural matter their mother ’s property have not be divide and levin take charge of both their share levin feel that he could not for some reason begin to talk to he of his intention of marry he feel that his brother would not look at it as he would have wish he to " well how be your district council do " ask sergey ivanovitch who be greatly interested in these local board and attach great importance to they " I really do not know " " what why surely you ’re a member of the board " " no I ’m not a member now I ’ve resign " answer levin " and I no long attend the meeting " " what a pity " comment sergey ivanovitch frown levin in selfdefense begin to describe what take place in the meeting in his district " that ’ how it always be " sergey ivanovitch interrupt he " we russians be always like that perhaps it ’ our strong point really the faculty of see our own shortcoming but we overdo it we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongue all I say be give such right as our local selfgovernment to any other european people — why the germans or the english would have work their way to freedom from they while we simply turn they into ridicule " " but how can it be help " say levin penitently " it be my last effort and I do try with all my soul I can n’t I ’m no good at it " " it ’ not that you ’re no good at it " say sergey ivanovitch " it be that you do not look at it as you should " " perhaps not " levin answer dejectedly " oh do you know brother nikolay ’ turn up again " this brother nikolay be the eld brother of konstantin levin and halfbrother of sergey ivanovitch a man utterly ruin who have dissipate the great part of his fortune be live in the strange and low company and have quarrel with his brother " what do you say " levin cry with horror " how do you know " " prokofy see he in the street " " here in moscow where be he do you know " levin get up from his chair as though on the point of start off at once " I be sorry I tell you " say sergey ivanovitch shake his head at his young brother ’s excitement " I send to find out where he be live and send he his iou to trubin which I pay this be the answer he send I " and sergey ivanovitch take a note from under a paperweight and hand it to his brother levin read in the queer familiar handwriting " I humbly beg you to leave I in peace that ’ the only favor I ask of my gracious brother — nikolay levin " levin read it and without raise his head stand with the note in his hand opposite sergey ivanovitch there be a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time and the consciousness that it would be base to do so " he obviously want to offend I " pursue sergey ivanovitch " but he can not offend I and I should have wish with all my heart to assist he but I know it ’ impossible to do that " " yes yes " repeat levin " I understand and appreciate your attitude to he but I shall go and see he " " if you want to do but I should not advise it " say sergey ivanovitch " as regard myself I have no fear of your do so he will not make you quarrel with I but for your own sake I should say you would do well not to go you can not do he any good still do as you please " " very likely I can not do any good but I feel — especially at such a moment — but that ’ another thing — I feel I could not be at peace " " well that I do not understand " say sergey ivanovitch " one thing I do understand " he add " it ’ a lesson in humility I have come to look very differently and more charitably on what be call infamous since brother nikolay have become what he be   you know what he do " " oh it ’ awful awful " repeat levin after obtain his brother ’s address from sergey ivanovitch ’s footman levin be on the point of set off at once to see he but on second thought he decide to put off his visit till the evening the first thing to do to set his heart at rest be to accomplish what he have come to moscow for from his brother ’s levin go to oblonsky ’s office and on get news of the shtcherbatskys from he he drive to the place where he have be tell he might find kitty at four o’clock conscious of his throb heart levin step out of a hire sledge at the zoological garden and turn along the path to the frozen mound and the skating ground know that he would certainly find she there as he have see the shtcherbatskys ' carriage at the entrance it be a bright frosty day row of carriage sledge driver and policeman be stand in the approach crowd of welldressed people with hat bright in the sun swarm about the entrance and along the wellswept little path between the little house adorn with carving in the russian style the old curly birch of the garden all their twig laden with snow look as though freshly deck in sacred vestment he walk along the path towards the skatingground and keep say to himself—“you must not be excited you must be calm what ’ the matter with you what do you want be quiet stupid " he conjure his heart and the more he try to compose himself the more breathless he find himself an acquaintance meet he and call he by his name but levin do not even recognize he he go towards the mound whence come the clank of the chain of sledge as they slip down or be drag up the rumble of the slide sledge and the sound of merry voice he walk on a few step and the skatingground lie open before his eye and at once amidst all the skater he know she he know she be there by the rapture and the terror that seize on his heart she be stand talk to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there be apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she be as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettle everything be make bright by she she be the smile that shed light on all round she " be it possible I can go over there on the ice go up to she " he think the place where she stand seem to he a holy shrine unapproachable and there be one moment when he be almost retreat so overwhelmed be he with terror he have to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sort be move about she and that he too might come there to skate he walk down for a long while avoid look at she as at the sun but see she as one do the sun without look on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquaint with one another use to meet on the ice there be crack skater there show off their skill and learner cling to chair with timid awkward movement boy and elderly people skate with hygienic motive they seem to levin an elect band of blissful being because they be here near she all the skater it seem with perfect selfpossession skate towards she skate by she even speak to she and be happy quite apart from she enjoy the capital ice and the fine weather nikolay shtcherbatsky kitty ’s cousin in a short jacket and tight trouser be sit on a garden seat with his skate on see levin he shout to he " ah the first skater in russia be here long firstrate ice — do put your skate on " " I have not get my skate " levin answer marvel at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second lose sight of she though he do not look at she he feel as though the sun be come near he she be in a corner and turn out her slender foot in their high boot with obvious timidity she skate towards he a boy in russian dress desperately wave his arm and bow down to the ground overtake she she skate a little uncertainly take her hand out of the little muff that hang on a cord she hold they ready for emergency and look towards levin whom she have recognize she smile at he and at her own fear when she have get round the turn she give herself a push off with one foot and skate straight up to shtcherbatsky clutch at his arm she nod smile to levin she be more splendid than he have imagine she when he think of she he could call up a vivid picture of she to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulder and so full of childish brightness and good humor the childishness of her expression together with the delicate beauty of her figure make up her special charm and that he fully realize but what always strike he in she as something unlooke for be the expression of her eye soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transport levin to an enchanted world where he feel himself softened and tender as he remember himself in some day of his early childhood " have you be here long " she say give he her hand " thank you " she add as he pick up the handkerchief that have fall out of her muff " I I ’ve not long   yesterday   I mean today   I arrive " answer levin in his emotion not at once understand her question " I be mean to come and see you " he say and then recollect with what intention he be try to see she he be promptly overcome with confusion and blush " I do not know you could skate and skate so well " she look at he earnestly as though wish to make out the cause of his confusion " your praise be worth have the tradition be keep up here that you be the good of skater " she say with her little blackgloved hand brush a grain of hoarfrost off her muff " yes I use once to skate with passion I want to reach perfection " " you do everything with passion I think " she say smile " I should so like to see how you skate put on skate and let we skate together " " skate together can that be possible " think levin gaze at she " I ’ll put they on directly " he say and he go off to get skate " it ’ a long while since we ’ve see you here sir " say the attendant support his foot and screw on the heel of the skate " except you there ’ none of the gentleman firstrate skater will that be all right " say he tighten the strap " oh yes yes make haste please " answer levin with difficulty restrain the smile of rapture which would overspread his face " yes " he think " this now be life this be happiness together she say let we skate together speak to she now but that ’ just why I ’m afraid to speak — because I ’m happy now happy in hope anyway and then but I must I must I must away with weakness " levin rise to his foot take off his overcoat and scurry over the rough ice round the hut come out on the smooth ice and skate without effort as it be by simple exercise of will increase and slacken speed and turn his course he approach with timidity but again her smile reassure he she give he her hand and they set off side by side go fast and fast and the more rapidly they move the more tightly she grasp his hand " with you I should soon learn I somehow feel confidence in you " she say to he " and I have confidence in myself when you be lean on I " he say but be at once panicstricken at what he have say and blush and indeed no soon have he utter these word when all at once like the sun go behind a cloud her face lose all its friendliness and levin detect the familiar change in her expression that denote the working of thought a crease show on her smooth brow " be there anything trouble you — though I ’ve no right to ask such a question " he add hurriedly " oh why so no I have nothing to trouble I " she respond coldly and she add immediately " you have not see mlle linon have you " " not yet " " go and speak to she she like you so much " " what ’ wrong I have offend she lord help I " think levin and he fly towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlet who be sit on a bench smile and show her false tooth she greet he as an old friend " yes you see we ’re grow up " she say to he glance towards kitty " and grow old tiny bear have grow big now " pursue the frenchwoman laugh and she remind he of his joke about the three young lady whom he have compare to the three bear in the english nursery tale " do you remember that ’ what you use to call they " he remember absolutely nothing but she have be laugh at the joke for ten year now and be fond of it " now go and skate go and skate our kitty have learn to skate nicely have not she " when levin dart up to kitty her face be no long stern her eye look at he with the same sincerity and friendliness but levin fancy that in her friendliness there be a certain note of deliberate composure and he feel depressed after talk a little of her old governess and her peculiarity she question he about his life " surely you must be dull in the country in the winter be not you " she say " no I ’m not dull I be very busy " he say feel that she be hold he in check by her composed tone which he would not have the force to break through just as it have be at the beginning of the winter " be you go to stay in town long " kitty question he " I do not know " he answer not think of what he be say the thought that if he be hold in check by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by go back again without decide anything come into his mind and he resolve to make a struggle against it " how be it you do not know " " I do not know it depend upon you " he say and be immediately horrorstricken at his own word whether it be that she have hear his word or that she do not want to hear they she make a sort of stumble twice strike out and hurriedly skate away from he she skate up to mlle linon say something to she and go towards the pavilion where the lady take off their skate " my god what have I do merciful god help I guide I " say levin pray inwardly and at the same time feel a need of violent exercise he skate about describe inner and outer circle at that moment one of the young man the good of the skater of the day come out of the coffeehouse in his skate with a cigarette in his mouth take a run he dash down the step in his skate crash and bound up and down he fly down and without even change the position of his hand skate away over the ice " ah that ’ a new trick " say levin and he promptly run up to the top to do this new trick " do not break your neck it need practice " nikolay shtcherbatsky shout after he levin go to the step take a run from above as well he could and dash down preserve his balance in this unwonted movement with his hand on the last step he stumble but barely touch the ice with his hand with a violent effort recover himself and skate off laugh " how splendid how nice he be " kitty be think at that time as she come out of the pavilion with mlle linon and look towards he with a smile of quiet affection as though he be a favorite brother " and can it be my fault can I have do anything wrong they talk of flirtation I know it ’ not he that I love but still I be happy with he and he ’ so jolly only why do he say that " she muse catch sight of kitty go away and her mother meet she at the step levin flush from his rapid exercise stand still and ponder a minute he take off his skate and overtake the mother and daughter at the entrance of the garden " delighted to see you " say princess shtcherbatskaya " on thursdays we be home as always " " today then " " we shall be pleased to see you " the princess say stiffly this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mother ’s coldness she turn her head and with a smile say " goodbye till this evening " at that moment stepan arkadyevitch his hat cock on one side with beaming face and eye stride into the garden like a conquer hero but as he approach his motherinlaw he respond in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiry about dolly ’s health after a little subdued and dejected conversation with his motherinlaw he throw out his chest again and put his arm in levin ’s " well shall we set off " he ask " I ’ve be think about you all this time and I ’m very very glad you ’ve come " he say look he in the face with a significant air " yes come

which " " all right then the england " say stepan arkadyevitch select that restaurant because he owe more there than at the hermitage and consequently consider it mean to avoid it " have you get a sledge that ’ firstrate for I send my carriage home " the friend hardly speak all the way levin be wonder what that change in kitty ’s expression have mean and alternately assure himself that there be hope and fall into despair see clearly that his hope be insane and you all the while he feel himself quite another man utterly unlike what he have be before her smile and those word " goodbye till this evening " stepan arkadyevitch be absorb during the drive in compose the menu of the dinner " you like turbot do not you " he say to levin as they be arrive " eh " respond levin " turbot yes I ’m

stepan arkadyevitch oblonsky take off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walk into the diningroom give direction to the tatar waiter who be cluster about he in evening coat bear napkin bow to right and left to the people he meet and here as everywhere joyously greet acquaintance he go up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka and say to the paint frenchwoman deck in ribbon lace and ringlet behind the counter something so amusing that even that frenchwoman be move to genuine laughter levin for his part refrain from take any vodka simply because he feel such a loathing of that frenchwoman all make up it seem of false hair poudre de riz and vinaigre de toilette he make haste to move away from she as from a dirty place his whole soul be fill with memory of kitty and there be a smile of triumph and happiness shine in his eye " this way your excellency please your excellency will not be disturb here " say a particularly pertinacious whiteheaded old tatar with immense hip and coattail gape widely behind " walk in your excellency " he say to levin by way of show his respect to stepan arkadyevitch be attentive to his guest as well instantly fling a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier though it already have a table cloth on it he push up velvet chair and come to a standstill before stepan arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hand await his command " if you prefer it your excellency a private room will be free directly prince golistin with a lady fresh oyster have come in " " ah oyster " stepan arkadyevitch become thoughtful " how if we be to change our program levin " he say keep his finger on the bill of fare and his face express serious hesitation " be the oyster good mind now " " they ’re flensburg

same to I I should like cabbage soup and porridge well than anything but of course there ’ nothing like that here " " porridge à la russe your honor would like " say the tatar bend down to levin like a nurse speak to a child " no joking apart whatever you choose be sure to be good I ’ve be skate and I ’m hungry and do not imagine " he add detect a look of dissatisfaction on oblonsky ’s face " that I shall not appreciate your choice I be fond of good thing " " I should hope so after all it ’ one of the pleasure of life " say stepan arkadyevitch " well then my friend you give we two — or well say three — dozen oyster clear soup with vegetable " " printanière " prompt the tatar but stepan arkadyevitch apparently do not care to allow he the satisfaction of give the french name of the dish " with

the dish by the name in the french bill of fare do not repeat they after he but could not resist rehearse the whole menu to himself accord to the bill—“soupe printanière turbot sauce beaumarchais poulard à l’estragon macédoine de fruits   etc " and then instantly as though work by springs lay down one bind bill of fare he take up another the list of wine and submit it to stepan arkadyevitch " what shall we drink " " what you like only not too much champagne " say levin " what to start with you ’re right though I dare say do you like the white seal " " cachet blanc " prompt the tatar " very well then give we that brand with the oyster and then we ’ll see " " yes sir and what table wine " " you can give we nuits oh no well the classic chablis " " yes sir and your cheese your excellency "

say strip the oyster from the pearly shell with a silver fork and swallow they one after another " not bad " he repeat turn his dewy brilliant eye from levin to the tatar levin eat the oyster indeed though white bread and cheese would have please he well but he be admire oblonsky even the tatar uncork the bottle and pour the sparkling wine into the delicate glass glance at stepan arkadyevitch and settle his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction " you do not care much for oyster do you " say stepan arkadyevitch empty his wineglass " or you ’re worried about something eh " he want levin to be in good spirit but it be not that levin be not in good spirit he be ill at ease with what he have in his soul he feel sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant in the midst of private room where man be dine with lady in all this fuss and bustle the surrounding of bronze lookingglasse gas and waiter — all of it be offensive to he he be afraid of sully what his soul be brimful of " I yes I be but besides all this bother I " he say " you can not conceive how queer it all seem to a country person like I as queer as that gentleman ’s nail I see at your place " " yes I see how much interested you be in poor grinevitch ’s nail " say stepan arkadyevitch laugh " it ’ too much for I " respond levin " do try now and put yourself in my place take the point of view of a country person we in the country try to bring our hand into such a state as will be most convenient for work with so we cut our nail sometimes we turn up our sleeve and here people purposely let their nail grow as long as they will and link on small saucer by way of stud so that they can do nothing with their hand " stepan arkadyevitch smile gaily " oh yes that ’ just a sign that he have no need to do coarse work his work be with the mind " " maybe but still it ’ queer to I just as at this moment it seem queer to I that we country folk try to get our meal over as soon as we can so as to be ready for our work while here be we try to drag out our meal as long as possible and with that object eat oyster " " why of course " object stepan arkadyevitch " but that ’ just the aim of civilization — to make everything a source of enjoyment " " well if that ’ its aim I ’d rather be a savage " " and so you be a savage all you levins be savage " levin sigh he remember his brother nikolay and feel ashamed and sore and he scowl but oblonsky begin speak of a subject which at once draw his attention " oh I say be you go tonight to our people the shtcherbatskys ' I mean " he say his eye sparkle significantly as he push away the empty rough shell and draw the cheese towards he " yes I shall certainly go " reply levin " though I fancy the princess be not very warm in her invitation " " what nonsense that ’ her manner come boy the soup that ’ her manner — grande dame " say stepan arkadyevitch " I ’m come too but I have to go to the countess bonina ’s rehearsal come be not it true that you

I do not want to talk of myself and besides I can not explain it all " say stepan arkadyevitch " well why have you come to moscow then hi take away " he call to the tatar " you guess " respond levin his eye like deep well of light fix on stepan arkadyevitch " I guess but I can not be the first to talk about it you can see by that whether I guess right or wrong " say stepan arkadyevitch gaze at levin with a subtle smile " well and what have you to say to I " say levin in a quivering voice feel that all the muscle of his face be quiver too " how do you look at the question " stepan arkadyevitch slowly empty his glass of chablis never take his eye off levin " I " say stepan arkadyevitch " there ’ nothing I desire so much as that — nothing it would be the good thing that could be " " but you ’re not make a mistake you know what we ’re speak of " say levin pierce he with his eye " you think it ’ possible " " I think it ’ possible why not possible " " no do you really think it ’ possible no tell I all you think oh but if   if refusal ’ in store for I indeed I feel sure " " why should you think that " say stepan arkadyevitch smile at his excitement " it seem so to I sometimes that will be awful for I and for she too " " oh well anyway there ’ nothing awful in it for a girl every girl ’ proud of an offer " " yes every girl but not she " stepan arkadyevitch smile he so well know that feeling of levin ’s that for he all the girl in the world be divide into two class one class — all the girl in the world except she and those girl with all sort of human weakness and very ordinary girl the other class — she alone have no weakness of any sort and high than all humanity " stay take some sauce " he say hold back levin ’s hand as it push away the sauce levin obediently help himself to sauce but would not let stepan arkadyevitch go on with his dinner " no stop a minute stop a minute " he say " you must understand that it ’ a question of life and death for I I have never speak to anyone of this and there ’ no one I could speak of it to except you you know we ’re utterly unlike each other different taste and view and everything but I know you ’re fond of I and understand I and that ’ why I like you awfully but for god ’s sake be quite straightforward with I " " I tell you what I think " say stepan arkadyevitch smile " but I ’ll say more my wife be a wonderful woman " stepan arkadyevitch sigh remember his position with his wife and after a moment ’s silence resumed—“she have a gift of foresee thing she see right through people but that ’ not all she know what will come to pass especially in the way of marriage she foretell for instance that princess shahovskaya would marry brenteln no one would believe it but it come to pass and she ’ on your side " " how do you mean " " it ’ not only that she like you — she say that kitty be certain to be your wife " at these word levin ’s face suddenly light up with a smile a smile not far from tear of emotion " she say that " cry levin " I always say she be exquisite your wife there that ’ enough enough say about it " he say get up from his seat " all right but do sit down " but levin could not sit down he walk with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room blink his eyelid that his tear might not fall and only then sit down to the table " you must understand " say he " it ’ not love I ’ve be in love but it ’ not that it ’ not my feeling but a sort of force outside I have take possession of I I go away you see because I make up my mind that it could never be you understand as a happiness that do not come on earth but I ’ve struggle with myself I see there ’ no living without it and it must be settle " " what do you go away for " " ah stop a minute ah the thought that come crowd on one the question one must ask oneself listen you can not imagine what you ’ve do for I by what you say I ’m so happy that I ’ve become positively hateful I ’ve forget everything I hear today that my brother nikolay   you know he ’ here   I have even forget he it seem to I that he ’ happy too it ’ a sort of madness but one thing ’ awful here you ’ve be marry you know the feeling   it ’ awful that we — old — with a past   not of love but of sin   be bring all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent it ’ loathsome and that ’ why one can not help feel oneself unworthy " " oh well you ’ve not many sin on your conscience " " alas all the same " say levin " when with loathing I go over my life I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it yes " " what would you have the world ’ make so " say stepan arkadyevitch " the one comfort be like that prayer which I always like ' forgive I not accord to my unworthiness but accord to thy lovingkindness ' that ’ the only way she can forgive I " levin empty his glass and they be silent for a while " there ’ one other thing I ought to tell you do you know vronsky " stepan arkadyevitch ask levin " no I do not why do you ask " " give we another bottle " stepan arkadyevitch direct the tatar who be fill up their glass and fidget round they just when he be not want " why you ought to know vronsky be that he ’ one of your rival " " who ’ vronsky " say levin and his face be suddenly transform from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky have just be admire to an angry and unpleasant expression " vronsky be one of the son of count kirill ivanovitch vronsky and one of the fine specimen of the gilded youth of petersburg I make his acquaintance in tver when I be there on official business and he come there for the levy of recruit fearfully rich handsome great connection an aidedecamp and with all that a very nice goodnatured fellow but he ’ more than simply a goodnatured fellow as I ’ve find out here — he ’ a cultivated man too and very intelligent he ’ a man who ’ll make his mark " levin scowl and be dumb " well he turn up here soon after you ’d go and as I can see he ’ over head and ear in love with kitty and you know that her mother " " excuse I but I know nothing " say levin frown gloomily and immediately he recollect his brother nikolay and how hateful he be to have be able to forget he " you wait a bit wait a bit " say stepan arkadyevitch smile and touch his hand " I ’ve tell you what I know and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture I believe the chance be in your favor " levin drop back in his chair his face be pale " but I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be " pursue oblonsky fill up his glass " no thank I can not drink any more " say levin push away his glass " I shall be drunk come tell I how be you get on " he go on obviously anxious to change the conversation " one word more in any case I advise you to settle the question soon tonight I do not advise you to speak " say stepan arkadyevitch " go round tomorrow morning make an offer in due form and god bless you " " oh do you still think of come to I for some shooting come next spring do " say levin now his whole soul be full of remorse that he have begin this conversation with stepan arkadyevitch a feeling such as his be profane by talk of the rivalry of some petersburg officer of the supposition and the counsel of stepan arkadyevitch stepan arkadyevitch smile he know what be pass in levin ’s soul " I ’ll come some day " he say " but woman my boy they ’re the pivot everything turn upon thing be in a bad way with I very bad and it ’ all through woman tell I frankly now " he pursue pick up a cigar and keep one hand on his glass " give I your advice " " why what be it " " I ’ll tell you suppose you ’re married you love your wife but you ’re fascinate by another woman " " excuse I but I ’m absolutely unable to comprehend how   just as I can not comprehend how I could now after my dinner go straight to a baker ’s shop and steal a roll " stepan arkadyevitch ’s eye sparkle more than usual " why not a roll will sometimes smell so good one can not resist it " " himmlisch ist ’s wenn ich bezwungen meine irdische begier aber doch wenn ’ nich gelungen hatt ' ich auch recht hübsch plaisir " as he say this stepan arkadyevitch smile subtly levin too could not help smile " yes but joke apart " resume stepan arkadyevitch " you must understand that the woman be a sweet gentle love creature poor and lonely and have sacrifice everything now when the thing ’ do do not you see can one possibly cast she off even suppose one part from she so as not to break up one ’s family life still can one help feel for she set she on her foot soften her lot " " well you must excuse I there you know to I all woman be divide into two class   at least no   true to say there be woman and there be   I ’ve never see exquisite fall being and I never shall see they but such creature as that paint frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlet be vermin to my mind and all fall woman be the same " " but the magdalen " " ah drop that christ would never have say those word if he have know how they would be abuse of all the gospel those word be the only one remember however I ’m not say so much what I think as what I feel I have a loathing for fall woman you ’re afraid of spider and I of these vermin most likely you ’ve not make a study of spider and do not know their character and so it be with I " " it ’ very well for you to talk like that it ’ very much like that gentleman in dickens who use to fling all difficult question over his right shoulder but to deny the fact be no answer what ’ to be do — you tell I that what ’ to be do your wife get old while you ’re full of life before you ’ve time to look round you feel that you can not love your wife with love however much you may esteem she and then all at once love turn up and you ’re do for do for " stepan arkadyevitch say with weary despair levin half smile " yes you ’re do for " resume oblonsky " but what ’ to be do " " do not steal roll " stepan arkadyevitch laugh outright " oh moralist but you must understand there be two woman one insist only on her right and those right be your love which you can not give she and the other sacrifice everything for you and ask for nothing what be you to do how be you to act there ’ a fearful tragedy in it " " if you care for my profession of faith as regard that I ’ll tell you that I do not believe there be any tragedy about it and this be why to my mind love   both the sort of love which you remember plato define in his banquet serve as the test of man some man only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love have no need to talk of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy ' I ’m much obliged for the gratification my humble respects’—that ’ all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all be clear and pure because " at that instant levin recollect his own sin and the inner conflict he have live through and he add unexpectedly " but perhaps you be right very likely   I do not know I do not know " " it ’ this do not you see " say stepan arkadyevitch " you ’re very much all of a piece that ’ your strong point and your failing you have a character that ’ all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too — but that ’ not how it be you despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably correspond all the while with the aim — and that ’ not how it be you want a man ’s work too always to have a define aim and love and family life always to be undivided — and that ’ not how it be all the you all the charm all the beauty of life be make up of light and shadow " levin sigh and make no reply he be think of his own affair and do not hear oblonsky and suddenly both of they feel that though they be friend though they have be dine and drink together which should have draw they close yet each be think only of his own affair and they have nothing to do with one another oblonsky have more than once experience this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy come on after dinner and he know what to do in such case " bill " he call and he go into the next room where he promptly come across an aidedecamp of his acquaintance and drop into conversation with he about an actress and her protector and at once in the conversation with the aidedecamp oblonsky have a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with levin which always put he to too great a mental and spiritual strain when the tatar appear with a bill for twentysix rouble and odd kopeck besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have be horrify like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen rouble do not notice it pay and set off homewards to dress and go to the shtcherbatskys ' there to decide his fate the young princess kitty shtcherbatskaya be eighteen it be the first winter that she have be out in the world her success in society have be great than that of either of her eld sister and great even than her mother have anticipate to say nothing of the young man who dance at the moscow ball be almost all in love with kitty two serious suitor have already this first winter make their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky levin ’s appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visit and evident love for kitty have lead to the first serious conversation between kitty ’s parent as to her future and to dispute between they the prince be on levin ’s side he say he wish for nothing well for kitty the princess for her part go round the question in the manner peculiar to woman maintain that kitty be too young that levin have do nothing to prove that he have serious intention that kitty feel no great attraction to he and other side issue but she do not state the principal point which be that she look for a well match for her daughter and that levin be not to her liking and she do not understand he when levin have abruptly depart the princess be delighted and say to her husband triumphantly " you see I be right " when vronsky appear on the scene she be still more delighted confirm in her opinion that kitty be to make not simply a good but a brilliant match in the mother ’s eye there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin she dislike in levin his strange and uncompromising opinion and his shyness in society found as she suppose on his pride and his queer sort of life as she consider it absorb in cattle and peasant she do not very much like it that he who be in love with her daughter have keep come to the house for six week as though he be wait for something inspect as though he be afraid he might be do they too great an honor by make an offer and do not realize that a man who continually visit at a house where there be a young unmarried girl be bind to make his intention clear and suddenly without do so he disappear " it ’ as well he ’ not attractive enough for kitty to have fall in love with he " think the mother vronsky satisfy all the mother ’s desire very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing well could be wish for vronsky openly flirt with kitty at ball dance with she and come continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intention but in spite of that the mother have spend the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation princess shtcherbatskaya have herself be marry thirty year ago her aunt arrange the match her husband about whom everything be well know beforehand have come look at his future bride and be look at the matchmaking aunt have ascertain and communicate their mutual impression that impression have be favorable afterwards on a day fix beforehand the expect offer be make to her parent and accept all have pass very simply and easily so it seem at least to the princess but over her own daughter she have feel how far from simple and easy be the business apparently so commonplace of marry off one ’s daughter the panic that have be live through the thought that have be brood over the money that have be waste and the dispute with her husband over marry the two eld girl darya and natalia now since the young have come out she be go through the same terror the same doubt and still more violent quarrel with her husband than she have over the eld girl the old prince like all father indeed be exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughter he be irrationally jealous over his daughter especially over kitty who be his favorite at every turn he have scene with the princess for compromise her daughter the princess have grow accustomed to this already with her other daughter but now she feel that there be more ground for the prince ’s touchiness she see that of late year much be change in the manner of society that a mother ’s duty have become still more difficult she see that girl of kitty ’s age form some sort of club go to some sort of lecture mix freely in man ’s society drive about the street alone many of they do not curtsey and what be the most important thing all the girl be firmly convince that to choose their husband be their own affair and not their parent ' " marriage be not make nowadays as they use to be " be think and say you all these young girl and even by their elder but how marriage be make now the princess could not learn from anyone the french fashion — of the parent arrange their child ’s future — be not accept it be condemn the english fashion of the complete independence of girl be also not accept and not possible in russian society the russian fashion of matchmaking by the office of intermediate person be for some reason consider unseemly it be ridicule by everyone and by the princess herself but how girl be to be marry and how parent be to marry they no one know everyone with whom the princess have chance to discuss the matter say the same thing " mercy on we it ’ high time in our day to cast off all that oldfashioned business it ’ the young people have to marry and not their parent and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose " it be very easy for anyone to say that who have no daughter but the princess realize that in the process of get to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall in love with someone who do not care to marry she or who be quite unfit to be her husband and however much it be instill into the princess that in our time young people ought to arrange their life for themselves she be unable to believe it just as she would have be unable to believe that at any time whatever the most suitable plaything for child five year old ought to be load pistol and so the princess be more uneasy over kitty than she have be over her eld sister now she be afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirt with her daughter she see that her daughter be in love with he but try to comfort herself with the thought that he be an honorable man and would not do this but at the same time she know how easy it be with the freedom of manner of today to turn a girl ’s head and how lightly man generally regard such a crime the week before kitty have tell her mother of a conversation she have with vronsky during a mazurka this conversation have partly reassure the princess but perfectly at ease she could not be vronsky have tell kitty that both he and his brother be so used to obey their mother that they never make up their mind to any important undertaking without consult she " and just now I be impatiently await my mother ’s arrival from petersburg as peculiarly fortunate " he tell she kitty have repeat this without attach any significance to the word but her mother see they in a different light she know that the old lady be expect from day to day that she would be pleased at her son ’s choice and she feel it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vex his mother however she be so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fear that she believe it be so bitter as it be for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eld daughter dolly on the point of leave her husband her anxiety over the decision of her young daughter ’s fate engross all her feeling today with levin ’s reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arise she be afraid that her daughter who have at one time as she fancy a feeling for levin might from extreme sense of honor refuse vronsky and that levin ’s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near be conclude " why have he be here long " the princess ask about levin as they return home " he come today mamma " " there ’ one thing I want to say " begin the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guess what it would be " mamma " she say flush hotly and turn quickly to she " please please do not say anything about that I know I know all about it " she wish for what her mother wish for but the motive of her mother ’s wish wound she " I only want to say that to raise hope " " mamma darling for goodness ' sake do not talk about it it ’ so horrible to talk about it " " I will not " say her mother see the tear in her daughter ’s eye " but one thing my love you promise I you would have no secret from I you will n’t " " never mamma none " answer kitty flush a little and look her mother straight in the face " but there ’ no use in my tell you anything and I   I   if I want to I do not know what to say or how I do not know " " no she could not tell an untruth with those eye " think the mother smile at her agitation and happiness the princess smile that what be take place just now in her soul seem to the poor child so immense and so important after dinner and till the beginning of the evening kitty be feel a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle her heart throb violently and her thought would not rest on anything she feel that this evening when they would both meet for the first time would be a turn point in her life and she be continually picture they to herself at one moment each separately and then both together when she muse on the past she dwell with pleasure with tenderness on the memory of her relation with levin the memory of childhood and of levin ’s friendship with her dead brother give a special poetic charm to her relation with he his love for she of which she feel certain be flattering and delightful to she and it be pleasant for she to think of levin in her memory of vronsky there always enter a certain element of awkwardness though he be in the high degree wellbred and at ease as though there be some false note — not in vronsky he be very simple and nice but in herself while with levin she feel perfectly simple and clear but on the other hand directly she think of the future with vronsky there arise before she a perspective of brilliant happiness with levin the future seem misty when she go upstairs to dress and look into the lookingglass she notice with joy that it be one of her good day and that she be in complete possession of all her force — she need this so for what lie before she she be conscious of external composure and free grace in her movement at halfpast seven she have only just go down into the drawingroom when the footman announce " konstantin dmitrievitch levin " the princess be still in her room and the prince have not come in " so it be to be " think kitty and all the blood seem to rush to her heart she be horrified at her paleness as she glance into the lookingglass at that moment she know beyond doubt that he have come early on purpose to find she alone and to make she an offer and only then for the first time the whole thing present itself in a new different aspect only then she realize that the question do not affect she only — with whom she would be happy and whom she love — but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she like and to wound he cruelly what for because he dear fellow love she be in love with she but

meet consist in make fun of he " I do like it when he look down at I from the height of his grandeur or break off his learned conversation with I because I ’m a fool or be condescending to I I like that so to see he condescending I be so glad he can not bear I " she use to say of he she be right for levin actually could not bear she and despise she for what she be proud of and regard as a fine characteristic — her nervousness her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly the countess nordston and levin get into that relation with one another not seldom see in society when two person who remain externally on friendly term despise each other to such a degree that they can not even take each other seriously and can not even be offend by each other the countess nordston pounce upon levin at once " ah konstantin dmitrievitch so you ’ve come back to our corrupt babylon " she say give he her tiny yellow hand and recall what he have chance to say early in the winter that moscow be a babylon " come be babylon reform or have you degenerate " she add glance with a simper at kitty " it ’ very flattering for I countess that you remember my word so well " respond levin who have succeed in recover his composure and at once from habit drop into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordston " they must certainly make a great impression on you " " oh I should think so I always note they all down well kitty have you be skate again " and she begin talk to kitty awkward as it be for levin to withdraw now it would still have be easy for he to

he " shall you be long in moscow you ’re busy with the district council though be n’t you and can not be away for long " " no princess I ’m no long a member of the council " he say " I have come up

room and levin get up " excuse I countess but I really know nothing about it and can not tell you anything " he say and look round at the officer who come in behind the lady " that must be vronsky " think levin and to be sure of it glance at kitty she have already have time to look at vronsky and look round at levin and simply from the look in her eye that grow unconsciously bright levin know that she love that man know it as surely as if she have tell he so in word but what sort of a man be he now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man be like whom she love there be people who on meet a successful rival no matter in what be at once disposed to turn their back on everything good in he and to see only what be bad there be people on the other hand who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the quality by which he have outstrip they and seek with a throb ache at heart only what be good levin belong to the second class but he have no difficulty in find what be good and attractive in vronsky it be apparent at the first glance vronsky be a squarely build dark man not very tall with a goodhumored handsome and exceedingly calm and resolute face everything about his face and figure from his shortcropped black hair and freshly shave chin down to his loosely fitting brandnew uniform be simple and at the same time elegant make way for the lady who have come in vronsky go up to the princess and then to kitty as he approach she his beautiful eye shine with a specially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seem to levin bow carefully and respectfully over she he hold out his small broad hand to she greet and say a few word to everyone he sit down without once glance at levin who have never take his eye off he " let I introduce you " say the princess indicate levin " konstantin dmitrievitch levin count alexey kirillovitch vronsky " vronsky get up and look cordially at levin

hate town and we townspeople " say countess nordston " my word must make a deep impression on you since you remember they so well " say levin and suddenly conscious that he have say just the same thing before he redden vronsky look at levin and countess nordston and smile " be you always in the country " he inquire " I should think it must be dull in the winter " " it ’ not dull if one have work to do besides one ’ not dull by oneself " levin reply abruptly " I be fond of the country " say vronsky notice and affect not to notice levin ’s tone " but I hope count you would not consent to live in the country always " say countess nordston " I do not know I have never try for long I experience a queer feeling once " he go on " I never long so for the country russian country with bast shoe and peasant as when I be spend a winter with my mother in nice nice itself be dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento be only pleasant for a short time and it ’ just there that russia come back to I most vividly and especially the country it ’ as though " he talk on address both kitty and levin turn his serene friendly eye from one to the other and say obviously just what come into his head notice that countess nordston want to say something he stop short without finish what he have begin and listen attentively to she the conversation do not flag for an instant so that the princess who always keep in reserve in case a subject should be lack two heavy gun — the relative advantage of classical and of modern education and universal military service — have not to move out either of they while countess nordston have not a chance of chaff levin levin want to and could not take part in the general conversation say to himself every instant " now go " he still do not go as though wait for something the conversation fall upon tableturning and spirit and countess nordston who believe in spiritualism begin to describe the marvel she have see " ah countess you really must take I for pity ’s sake do take I to see they I have never see anything extraordinary though I be always on the lookout for it everywhere " say vronsky smile " very well next saturday " answer countess nordston " but you konstantin dmitrievitch do you believe in it " she ask levin " why do you ask I you know what I shall say " " but I want to hear your opinion " " my opinion " answer levin " be only that this tableturning simply prove that educate society — so call — be no high than the peasant they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and omen while we " " oh then you do not believe in it " " I can not believe in it countess " " but if I ’ve see it myself " " the peasant woman too tell we they have see goblin " " then you think I tell a lie " and she laugh a mirthless laugh " oh no masha konstantin dmitrievitch say he could not believe in it " say kitty blush for levin and levin see this and still more exasperated would have answer but vronsky with his bright frank smile rush to the support of the conversation which be threaten to become disagreeable " you do not admit the conceivability at all " he query " but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to we which " " when electricity be discover " levin interrupt hurriedly " it be only the phenomenon that be discover and it be unknown from what it proceed and what be its effect and age pass before its application be conceive but the spiritualist have begin with table write for they and spirit appear to they and have only later start say that it be an unknown force " vronsky listen attentively to levin as he always do listen obviously interested in his word " yes but the spiritualist say we do not know at present what this force be but there be a force and these be the condition in which it act let the scientific man find out what the force consist in no I do not see why there should not be a new force if it " " why because with electricity " levin interrupt again " every time you rub tar against wool a recognize phenomenon be manifest but in this case it do not happen every time and so it follow it be not a natural phenomenon " feeling probably that the conversation be take a tone too serious for a drawingroom vronsky make no rejoinder but by way of try to change the conversation he smile brightly and turn to the lady " do let we try at once countess " he say but levin would finish say what he think " I think " he go on " that this attempt of the spiritualist to explain their marvel as some sort of new natural force be most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment " everyone be wait for he to finish and he feel it " and I think you would be a firstrate medium " say countess nordston " there ’ something enthusiastic in you " levin open his mouth be about to say something redden and say nothing " do let we try tableturning at once please " say vronsky " princess will you allow it " and vronsky stand up look for a little table kitty get up to fetch a table and as she pass her eye meet levin ’s she feel for he with her whole heart the more because she be pity he for suffering of which she be herself the cause " if you can forgive I forgive I " say her eye " I be so happy " " I hate they all and you and myself " his eye respond and he take up his hat but he be not destine to escape just as they be arrange themselves round the table and levin be on the point of retire the old prince come in and after greet the lady address levin

and the last impression he carry away with he of that evening be the smile happy face of kitty answer vronsky ’s inquiry about the ball at the end of the evening kitty tell her mother of her conversation with levin and in spite of all the pity she feel for levin she be glad at the thought that she have receive an offer she have no doubt that she have act rightly but after she have go to

" why you ’ve " the prince be cry wrathfully " I know if one be to listen to you " interrupt the princess " we should never marry our daughter if it ’ to be so we ’d well go into the country " " well and we have well " " but do wait a minute do I try and catch they I do not try to catch they in the least a young man and a very nice one have fall in love with she and she I fancy " " oh yes you fancy and how if she really be in love and he ’ no more think of marriage than I be oh that I should live to see it ah spiritualism ah nice ah the ball " and the prince imagine that he be mimic his wife make a mincing curtsey at each word " and this be how we ’re prepare wretchedness for kitty and she ’ really get the notion into her head " " but what make you suppose so " " I do not suppose I know we have eye for such thing though womenfolk have not I see a man who have serious intention that ’ levin and I see a peacock like this featherhead who ’ only amuse himself " " oh well when once you get an idea into your head " " well you ’ll remember my word but too late just as with dolly " " well well we will not talk of it " the princess stop he recollect her unlucky dolly " you all mean and goodnight " and sign each other with the cross the husband and wife part with a kiss feel that they each remain of their own opinion the princess have at first be quite certain that that evening have settle kitty ’s future and that there could be no doubt of vronsky ’s intention but her husband ’s word have disturb she and return to her own room in terror before the unknown future she too like kitty repeat several time in her heart " lord have pity lord have pity lord have pity " vronsky have never have a real home life his mother have be in her youth a brilliant society woman who have have during her married life and still more afterwards many love affair notorious in the whole fashionable world his father he scarcely remember and he have be educate in the corps of pages leave the school very young as a brilliant officer he have at once get into the circle of wealthy petersburg army man although he do go more or less into petersburg society his love affair have always hitherto be outside it in moscow he have for the first time feel after his luxurious and coarse life at petersburg all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank who care for he it never even enter his head that there could be any harm in his relation with kitty at ball he dance principally with she he be a constant visitor at their house he talk to she as people commonly do talk in society — all sort of nonsense but nonsense to which he could not help attach a special meaning in her case although he say nothing to she that he could not have say before everybody he feel that she be become more and more dependent upon he and the more he feel this the well he like it and the tenderer be his feeling for she he do not know that his mode of behavior in relation to kitty have a definite character that it be court young girl with no intention of marriage and that such courting be one of the evil action common among brilliant young man such as he be it seem to he that he be the first who have discover this pleasure and he be enjoy his discovery if he could have hear what her parent be say that evening if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have hear that kitty would be unhappy if he do not marry she he would have be greatly astonished and would not have believe it he could not believe that what give such great and delicate pleasure to he and above all to she could be wrong still less could he have believe that he ought to marry marriage have never present itself to he as a possibility he not only dislike family life but a family and especially a husband be in accordance with the view general in the bachelor world in which he live conceive as something alien repellant and above all ridiculous but though vronsky have not the least suspicion what the parent be say he feel on come away from the shtcherbatskys ' that the secret spiritual bond which exist between he and kitty have grow so much strong that evening that some step must be take but what step could and ought to be take he could not imagine " what be so exquisite " he think as he return from the shtcherbatskys ' carry away with he as he always do a delicious feeling of purity and freshness arise partly from the fact that he have not be smoke for a whole evening and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him—“what be so exquisite be that not a word have be say by I or by she but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of look and tone that this evening more clearly than ever she tell I she love I and how secretly simply and most of all how trustfully I feel myself well pure I feel that I have a heart and that there be a great deal of good in I those sweet love eye when she say ' indeed I do ' " well what then oh nothing it ’ good for I and good for she " and he begin wonder where to finish the evening he pass in review of the place he might go to " club a game of bezique champagne with ignatov no I ’m not go château des fleurs there I shall find oblonsky song the cancan no I ’m sick of it that ’ why I like the shtcherbatskys ' that I ’m grow well I ’ll go home " he go straight to his room at dussots ' hotel order supper and then undress and as soon as his head touch the pillow fall into a sound sleep next day at eleven o’clock in the morning vronsky drive to the station of the petersburg railway to meet his mother and the first person he come across on the great flight of step be oblonsky who be expect his sister by the same train " ah your excellency " cry oblonsky " whom be you meet " " my mother " vronsky respond smile as everyone do who meet oblonsky he shake hand with he and together they ascend the step " she be to be here from petersburg today " " I be look out for you till two o’clock last night where do you go after the shtcherbatskys ' " " home " answer vronsky " I must own I feel so well content yesterday after the shtcherbatskys ' that I do not care to go anywhere " " I know a gallant steed by token sure and by his eye I know a youth in love " declaim stepan arkadyevitch just as he have do before to levin vronsky smile with a look that seem to say that he do not deny it but he promptly change the subject " and whom be you meet " he ask " I I ’ve come to meet a pretty woman " say oblonsky " you do not say so " " honi soit qui mal y pense my sister anna " " ah that ’ madame karenina " say vronsky " you know she no doubt " " I think I do or perhaps not   I really be not sure " vronsky answer heedlessly with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoke by the name karenina " but alexey alexandrovitch my celebrated brotherinlaw you surely must know all the world know he " " I know he by reputation and by sight I know that he ’ clever learn religious somewhat but you know that ’ not   not in my line " say vronsky in english " yes he ’ a very remarkable man rather a conservative but a splendid man " observe stepan arkadyevitch " a splendid man " " oh well so much the well for he " say vronsky smile " oh you ’ve come " he say address a tall old footman of his mother ’s stand at the door " come here " besides the charm oblonsky have in general for everyone vronsky have feel of late specially draw to he by the fact that in his imagination he be associate with kitty " well what do you say shall we give a supper on sunday for the diva " he say to he with a smile take his arm " of course I ’m collect subscription oh do you make the acquaintance of my friend levin " ask stepan arkadyevitch " yes but he leave rather early " " he ’ a capital fellow " pursue oblonsky " be not he " " I do not know why it be " respond vronsky " in all moscow people — present company of course except " he put in jestingly " there ’ something uncompromising they be all on the defensive lose their temper as though you all want to make one feel something " " yes that ’ true it be so " say stepan arkadyevitch laugh goodhumoredly " will the train soon be in " vronsky ask a railway official " the train ’ signal " answer the man the approach of the train be more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station the rush of porter the movement of policeman and attendant and people meet the train through the frosty vapor could be see workman in short sheepskin and soft felt boot cross the rail of the curve line the hiss of the boiler could be hear on the distant rail and the rumble of something heavy " no " say stepan arkadyevitch who feel a great inclination to tell vronsky of levin ’s intention in regard to kitty " no you ’ve not get a true impression of levin he ’ a very nervous man and be sometimes out of humor it ’ true but then he be often very nice he ’ such a true honest nature and a heart of gold but yesterday there be special reason " pursue stepan arkadyevitch with a meaning smile totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he have feel the day before for his friend and feel the same sympathy now only for vronsky " yes there be reason why he could not help be either particularly happy or particularly unhappy " vronsky stand still and ask directly " how so do you mean he make your bellesœur an offer yesterday " " maybe " say stepan arkadyevitch " I fancy something of the sort yesterday yes if he go away early and be out of humor too it must mean it he ’ be so long in love and I ’m very sorry for he " " so that ’ it I should imagine though she might reckon on a well match " say vronsky draw himself up and walk about again " though I do not know he of course " he add " yes that be a hateful position that ’ why most fellow prefer to have to do with klaras if you do not succeed with they it only prove that you ’ve not enough cash but in this case one ’s dignity ’ at stake but here ’ the train " the engine

and do not touch on their feeling for their family they draw a sort of line that can not be cross between they and their family I do not understand it but it be so " " yes but he have kiss she " " dolly hush darling I see stiva when he be in love with you I remember the time when he come to I and cry talk of you and all the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you and I know that the long he

and married woman anna be not like a fashionable lady nor the mother of a boy of eight year old in the elasticity of her movement the freshness and the unflagging eagerness which persist in her face and break out in her smile and her glance she would rather have pass for a girl of twenty have it not be for a serious and at times mournful look in her eye which strike and attract kitty kitty feel that anna be perfectly simple and be conceal nothing but that she have another high world of interest inaccessible to her complex and poetic after dinner when dolly go away to her own room anna rise quickly and go up to her brother who be just light a cigar " stiva " she say to he wink gaily cross he and glance towards the door " go and god help you " he throw down the cigar understand she and depart through the doorway when stepan arkadyevitch have disappear she go back to the sofa where she have be sit surround by the child either because the child see that their mother be fond of this

arkadyevitch smile hardly perceptibly and address his wife the whole evening dolly be as always a little mocking in her tone to her husband while stepan arkadyevitch be happy and cheerful but not so as to seem as though have be forgive he have forget his offense at halfpast nine o’clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the teatable at the oblonskys ' be break up by an apparently simple incident but this simple incident for some reason strike everyone as strange talk about common acquaintance in petersburg anna get up quickly " she be in my album " she say " and by the way I ’ll show you my seryozha " she add with a mother ’s smile of pride towards ten o’clock when she usually say goodnight to her son and often before go to a ball put he to bed herself she feel

same time of dread of something stir in her heart he be stand still not take off his coat pull something out of his pocket at the instant when she be just face the stair he raise his eye catch sight of she and into the expression of his face there pass a shade of embarrassment and dismay with a slight inclination of her head she pass hear behind she stepan arkadyevitch ’s loud voice call he to

of they look at each other say nothing and begin to look at anna ’s album there be nothing either exceptional or strange in a man ’s calling at halfpast nine on a friend to inquire detail of a propose dinner party and not come in but it seem strange to all of they above all it seem strange and not right to anna the ball be only just begin as kitty and her mother walk up the great staircase flood with light and line with flower and footman in powder and red coat from the room come a constant steady hum as from a hive and the rustle of movement and while on the landing between tree they give last touch to their hair and dress before the mirror they hear from the ballroom the careful distinct note of the fiddle of the orchestra begin the first waltz a little old man in civilian dress arrange his gray curl before another mirror and diffuse an odor of scent stumble against they on the stair and stand aside evidently admire kitty whom he do not know a beardless youth one of those society youth whom the old prince shtcherbatsky call " young buck " in an exceedingly open waistcoat straighten his white tie as he go bow to they and after run by come back to ask kitty for a quadrille as the first quadrille have already be give to vronsky she have to promise this youth the second an officer button his glove stand aside in the doorway and stroke his mustache admire rosy kitty although her dress her coiffure and all the preparation for the ball have cost kitty great trouble and consideration at this moment she walk into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosette and lace all the minute detail of her attire have not cost she or her family a moment ’s attention as though she have be bear in that tulle and lace with her hair do up high on her head and a rose and two leave on the top of it when just before enter the ballroom the princess her mother try to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash

softness round her neck that velvet be delicious at home look at her neck in the lookingglass kitty have feel that that velvet be speak about all the rest there might be a doubt but the velvet be delicious kitty smile here too at the ball when she glance at it in the glass her bare shoulder and arm give kitty a sense of chill marble a feeling she particularly like her eye sparkle and her rosy

slender waist she look round for someone to give her fan to and their hostess smile to she take it " how nice you ’ve come in good time " he say to she embrace her waist " such a bad habit to be late " bend her left hand she lay it on his shoulder and her little foot in their pink slipper begin swiftly lightly and rhythmically move over the slippery floor in time to the music " it ’ a rest to waltz with you " he say to she as they fall into the first slow step of the waltz " it ’ exquisite — such lightness precision " he say to she the same thing he say to almost all his partner whom he know well she smile at his praise and continue to look about the room over his shoulder she be not like a girl at her first ball for whom all face in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland and she be not a girl who have go the stale round of ball till every face in the ballroom be familiar and tiresome but she be in the middle stage between these two she be excited and at the same time she have sufficient selfpossession to be able to observe in the left corner of the ballroom she see the cream of society gather together there — incredibly naked — be the beauty lidi korsunsky ’s wife there be the lady of the house there shine the bald head of krivin always to be find where the good people be in that direction gaze the young man not venture to approach there too she descry stiva

course through the sea of lace tulle and ribbon and not disarrange a feather he turn his partner sharply round so that her slim ankle in light transparent stocking be expose to view and her train float out in fan shape and cover krivin ’s knee korsunsky bow set straight his open shirt front and give she his arm to conduct she to anna arkadyevna kitty flush take her train from krivin ’s knee and a little giddy look round seek anna anna be not in lilac as kitty have so urgently wish but in a black lowcut velvet gown show her full throat and shoulder that look as though carve in old ivory and her rounded arm with tiny slender wrist the whole gown be trim with venetian guipure on her head among her black hair — her own with no false addition — be a little wreath of pansy and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace her coiffure be not strike all that be noticeable be the little wilful tendril of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temple round her wellcut strong neck be a thread of pearl kitty have be see anna every day she adore she and have picture she invariably in lilac but now see she in black she feel that she have not fully see her charm she see she now as someone quite new and surprising to she now she understand that anna could not have be in lilac and that her charm be just that she always stand out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on she and her black dress with its sumptuous lace be not noticeable on she it be only the frame and all that be see be she — simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and eager she be stand hold herself as always very erect and when kitty draw near the group she be speak to the master of the house her head slightly turn towards he " no I do not throw stone " she be say in answer to something " though I can not understand it " she go on shrug her shoulder and she turn at once with a soft smile of protection towards kitty with a flying feminine glance she scan her attire and make a movement of her head hardly perceptible but understand by kitty signify approval of her dress and her look " you come into the room dance " she

after the first waltz kitty go to her mother and she have hardly time to say a few word to countess nordston when vronsky come up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance be say there be disjointed talk between they of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he describe very amusingly as delightful child at forty and of the future town theater and only once the conversation touch she to the quick when he ask she about levin whether he be here and add that he like he so much but kitty do not expect much from the quadrille she look forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka she fancy that in the mazurka everything must be decide the fact that he do not during the quadrille ask she for the mazurka do not trouble she she feel sure she would dance

visàvis with vronsky and anna she have not be near anna again since the beginning of the evening and now again she see she suddenly quite new and surprising she see in she the sign of that excitement of success she know so well in herself she see that she be intoxicate with the delighted admiration she be exciting she know that feeling and know its sign and see they in anna see the quiver flash light in her eye and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously play on her lip and the deliberate grace precision and lightness of her movement " who " she ask herself " all or one " and not assist the harassed young man she be dance with in the conversation the thread of which he have lose and could not pick up again she obey with external liveliness the peremptory shout of korsunsky start they all into the grand rond and then into the chaîne and at the same time she keep watch with a grow pang at her heart " no it ’ not the admiration of the crowd have intoxicate she but the adoration of one and that one can it be he " every time he speak to anna the joyous light flash into her eye and the smile of happiness curve her red lip she seem to make an effort to control herself to try not to show these sign of delight but they come out on her face of themselves " but what of he " kitty look at he and be fill with terror what be picture so clearly to kitty in the mirror of anna ’s face she see in he what have become of his always selfpossesse resolute manner and the carelessly serene expression of his face now every time he turn to she he bend his head as though he would have fall at her foot and in his eye there be nothing but humble submission and dread " I would not offend you " his eye seem every time to be say " but I want to save myself and I do not know how " on his face be a look such as kitty have never see before they be speak of common acquaintance keep up the most trivial conversation but to kitty it seem that every word they say be determine their fate and hers and strange it be that they be actually talk of how absurd ivan ivanovitch be with his french and how the eletsky girl might have make a well match yet these word have all the while consequence for they and they be feel just as kitty do the whole ball the whole world everything seem lose in fog in kitty ’s soul nothing but the stern discipline of her bringingup support she and force she to do what be expect of she that be to dance to answer question to talk even to smile but before the mazurka when they be begin to rearrange the chair and a few couple move out of the small room into the big room a moment of despair and horror come for kitty she have refuse five partner and now she be not dance the mazurka she have not even a hope of be ask for it because she be so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she have remain disengaged till now she would have to tell her mother she feel ill and go home but she have not the strength to do this she feel crushed she go to the furth end of the little drawingroom and sink into a low chair her light transparent skirt rise like a cloud about her slender waist one bare thin soft girlish arm hang listlessly be lose in the fold of her pink tunic in the other she hold her fan and with rapid short stroke fan her burn face but while she look like a butterfly cling to a blade of grass and just about to open its rainbow wing for fresh flight her heart ache with a horrible despair " but perhaps I be wrong perhaps it be not so " and again she recall all she have see " kitty what be it " say countess nordston step noiselessly over the carpet towards she " I do not understand it " kitty ’s low lip begin to quiver she get up quickly " kitty you ’re not dance the mazurka " " no no " say

princess shtcherbatskaya ' " " oh I do not care " answer kitty no one but she herself understand her position no one know that she have just refuse the man whom perhaps she love and refuse he because she have put her faith in another countess nordston find korsunsky with whom she be to dance the mazurka and tell he to ask kitty kitty dance in the first couple and luckily for she she have not to talk because korsunsky be all the time run about direct the figure vronsky and anna sit almost opposite she she see they with her longsighted eye and see they too close by when they meet in the figure and the more she see of they the more convinced be she that her unhappiness be complete she see that they feel themselves alone in that crowded room and on vronsky ’s face always so firm and independent she see that look that have strike she of bewilderment and humble submissiveness like the expression of an intelligent dog when it have do wrong anna smile and her smile be reflect by he she grow thoughtful and he become serious some supernatural force draw kitty ’s eye to anna ’s face she be fascinating in her simple black dress fascinating be she round arm with their bracelet fascinating be her firm neck with its thread of pearl fascinating the stray curl of her loose hair fascinating the graceful light movement of her little foot and hand fascinating be that lovely face in its eagerness but there be something terrible and cruel in her fascination kitty admire she more than ever and more and more acute be her suffering kitty feel overwhelmed and her face show it when vronsky see she come across she in the mazurka he do not at once recognize she she be so changed " delightful ball " he say to she for the sake of say something " yes " she answer in the middle of the mazurka repeat a complicated figure newly invent by korsunsky anna come forward into the center of the circle choose two gentleman and summon a lady and kitty kitty gaze at she in dismay as she go up anna look at she with droop eyelid and smile press her hand but notice that kitty only respond to her smile by a look of despair and amazement she turn away from she and begin gaily talk to the other lady " yes there be something uncanny devilish and fascinating in her " kitty say to herself anna do not mean to stay to supper but the master of the house begin to press she to do so " nonsense anna arkadyevna " say korsunsky draw her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat " I ’ve such an idea for a cotillion un bijou " and he move gradually on try to draw she along with he their host smile approvingly " no I be not go to stay " answer anna smile but in spite of her smile both korsunsky and the master of the house see from her resolute tone that she would not stay " no why as it be I have dance more at your ball in moscow than I have all the winter in petersburg " say anna look round at vronsky who stand near she " I must rest a little before my journey " " be you certainly go tomorrow then " ask vronsky " yes I suppose so " answer anna as it be wonder at the boldness of his question but the irrepressible quiver brilliance of her eye and her smile set he on fire as she say it anna arkadyevna do not stay to supper but go home " yes there be something in I hateful repulsive " think levin as he come away from the shtcherbatskys ' and walk in the direction of his brother ’s lodging " and I do not get on with other people pride they say no I have no pride if I have any pride I should not have put myself in such a position " and he picture to himself vronsky happy goodnatured clever and selfpossessed certainly never place in the awful position in which he have be that evening " yes she be bind to choose he so it have to be and I can not complain of anyone or anything I be myself to blame what right have I to imagine she would care to join her life to mine who be I and what be I a nobody not want by anyone nor of use to anybody " and he recall his brother nikolay and dwell with pleasure on the thought of he " be not he right that everything in the world be base and loathsome and be we fair in our judgment of brother nikolay of course from the point of view of prokofy see he in a torn cloak and tipsy he ’ a despicable person but I know he differently I know his soul and know that we be like he and I instead of go to seek he out go out to dinner and come here " levin walk up to a lamppost read his brother ’s address which be in his pocketbook and call a sledge all the long way to his brother ’s levin vividly recall all the fact familiar to he of his brother nikolay ’s life he remember how his brother while at the university and for a year afterwards have in spite of the jeer of his companion live like a monk strictly observe all religious rite service and fast and avoid every sort of pleasure especially woman and afterwards how he have all at once break out he have associate with the most horrible people and rush into the most senseless debauchery he remember later the scandal over a boy whom he have take from the country to bring up and in a fit of rage have so violently beat that proceeding be bring against he for unlawfully wound then he recall the scandal with a sharp to whom he have lose money and give a promissory note and against whom he have himself lodge a complaint assert that he have cheat he this be the money sergey ivanovitch have pay then he remember how he have spend a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street he remember the shameful proceeding he have try to get up against his brother sergey ivanovitch accuse he of not have pay he his share of his mother ’s fortune and the last scandal when he have go to a western province in an official capacity and there have get into trouble for assault a village elder it be all horribly disgusting yet to levin it appear not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who do not know nikolay do not know all his story do not know his heart levin remember that when nikolay have be in the devout stage the period of fast and monk and church service when he be seek in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament everyone far from encourage he have jeer at he and he too with the other they have tease he call he noah and monk and when he have break out no one have help he but everyone have turn away from he with horror and disgust levin feel that in spite of all the ugliness of his life his brother nikolay in his soul in the very depth of his soul be no more in the wrong than the people who despise he he be not to blame for have be bear with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence but he have always want to be good " I will tell he everything without reserve and I will make he speak without reserve too and I ’ll show he that I love he and so understand he " levin resolve to himself as towards eleven o’clock he reach the hotel of which he have the address " at the top 12 and 13 " the porter answer levin ’s inquiry " at home " " sure to be at home " the door of no 12 be half open and there come out into the streak of light thick fume of cheap poor tobacco and the sound of a voice unknown to levin but he know at once that his brother be there he hear his cough as he go in the door the unknown voice be say " it all depend with how much judgment and knowledge the thing ’ do " konstantin levin look in at the door and see that the speaker be a young man with an immense shock of hair wear a russian jerkin and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown without collar or cuff be sit on the sofa his brother be not to be see konstantin feel a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spend his life no one have hear he and konstantin take off his galosh listen to what the gentleman in the jerkin be say he be speak of some enterprise " well the devil flay they the privileged class " his brother ’s voice respond with a cough " masha get we some supper and some wine if there ’ any leave or else go and get some " the woman rise come out from behind the screen and see konstantin " there ’ some gentleman nikolay dmitrievitch " she say " whom do you want " say the voice of nikolay levin angrily " it ’ I " answer konstantin levin come forward into the light " who ’ I " nikolay ’s voice say again still more angrily he could be hear get up hurriedly stumble against something and levin see face he in the doorway the big scared eye and the huge thin stoop figure of his brother so familiar and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness he be even thin than three year before when konstantin levin have see he last he be wear a short coat and his hand and big bone seem huge than ever his hair have grow thin the same straight mustache hide his lip the same eye gaze strangely and naïvely at his visitor " ah kostya " he exclaim suddenly recognize his brother and his eye light up with joy but the same second he look round at the young man and give the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin know so well as if his neckband hurt he and a quite different expression wild suffering and cruel rest on his emaciated face " I write to you and sergey ivanovitch both that I do not know you and do not want to know you what be it you want " he be not at all the same as konstantin have be fancy he the bad and most tiresome part of his character what make all relation with he so difficult have be forget by konstantin levin when he think of he and now when he see his face and especially that nervous twitching of his head he remember it all " I do not want to see you for anything " he answer timidly " I ’ve simply come to see you " his brother ’s timidity obviously soften nikolay his lip twitch " oh so that ’ it " he say " well come in sit down like some supper masha bring supper for three no stop a minute do you know who this be " he say address his brother and indicate the gentleman in the jerkin " this be mr kritsky my friend from kiev a very remarkable man he ’ persecute by the police of course because he ’ not a scoundrel " and he look round in the way he always do at everyone in the room see that the woman stand in the doorway be move to go he shout to she " wait a minute I say " and with the inability to express himself the incoherence that konstantin know so well he begin with another look round at everyone to tell his brother kritsky ’s story how he have be expel from the university for start a benefit society for the poor student and sunday school and how he have afterwards be a teacher in a peasant school and how he have be drive out of that too and have afterwards be condemn for something " you ’re of the kiev university " say konstantin levin to kritsky to break the awkward silence that follow " yes I be of kiev " kritsky reply angrily his face darken " and this woman " nikolay levin interrupt he point to she " be the partner of my life marya nikolaevna I take she out of a bad house " and he jerk his neck say this " but I love she and respect she and anyone who want to know I " he add raise his voice and knit his brow " I beg to love she and respect she she ’ just the same as my wife just the same so now you know whom you ’ve to do with and if you think you ’re lower yourself well here ’ the floor there ’ the door " and again his eye travel inquiringly over all of they " why I should be lower myself I do not understand " " then masha tell they to bring supper three portion spirit and wine no wait a minute no it do not matter go along " " so you see " pursue nikolay levin painfully wrinkle his forehead and twitch it be obviously difficult for he to think of what to say and do " here do you see " he point to some sort of iron bar fasten together with string lie in a corner of the room " do you see that that ’ the beginning of a new thing we ’re go into it ’ a productive association " konstantin scarcely hear he he look into his sickly consumptive face and he be more and more sorry for he and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother be tell he about the association he see that this association be a mere anchor to save he from selfcontempt nikolay levin go on talk " you know that capital oppress the laborer the laborer with we the peasant bear all the burden of labor and be so place that however much they work they can not escape from their position of beast of burden all the profit of labor on which they might improve their position and gain leisure for themselves and after that education all the surplus value be take from they by the capitalist and society ’ so constitute that the hard they work the great the profit of the merchant and landowner while they stay beast of burden to the end and that state of thing must be change " he finish up and he look questioningly at his brother " yes of course " say konstantin look at the patch of red that have come out on his brother ’s project cheekbone " and so we ’re found a locksmith ' association where all the production and profit and the chief instrument of production will be in common " " where be the association to be " ask konstantin levin " in the village of vozdrem kazan government " " but why in a village in the village I think there be plenty of work as it be why a locksmith ' association in a village " " why because the peasant be just as much slave as they ever be and that ’ why you and sergey ivanovitch do not like people to try and get they out of their slavery " say nikolay levin exasperate by the objection konstantin levin sigh look meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room this sigh seem to exasperate nikolay still more " I know your and sergey ivanovitch ’s aristocratic view I know that he apply all the power of his intellect to justify exist evil " " no and what do you talk of sergey ivanovitch for " say levin smile " sergey ivanovitch I ’ll tell you what for " nikolay levin shriek suddenly at the name of sergey ivanovitch " I ’ll tell you what for but what ’ the use of talk there ’ only one thing what do you come to I for you look down on this and you ’re welcome to — and go away in god ’s name go away " he shriek get up from his chair " and go away and go away " " I do not look down on it at all " say konstantin levin timidly " I do not even dispute it " at that instant marya nikolaevna come back nikolay levin look round angrily at she she go quickly to he and whisper something " I ’m not well I ’ve grow irritable " say nikolay levin get calm and breathe painfully " and then you talk to I of sergey ivanovitch and his article it ’ such rubbish such lying such selfdeception what can a man write of justice who know nothing of it have you read his article " he ask kritsky sit down again at the table and move back off half of it the scatter cigarette so as to clear a space " I ’ve not read it " kritsky respond gloomily obviously not desire to enter into the conversation " why not " say nikolay levin now turn with exasperation upon kritsky " because I do not see the use of waste my time over it " " oh but excuse I how do you know it would be waste your time that article ’ too deep for many people — that ’ to say it ’ over their head but with I it ’ another thing I see through his idea and I know where its weakness lie " everyone be mute kritsky get up deliberately and reach his cap " will not you have supper all right goodbye come round tomorrow with the locksmith " kritsky have hardly go out when nikolay levin smile and wink " he ’ no good either " he say " I see of course " but at that instant kritsky at the door call he " what do you want now " he say and go out to he in the passage leave alone with marya nikolaevna levin turn to she " have you be long with my brother " he say to she " yes more than a year nikolay dmitrievitch ’s health have become very poor nikolay dmitrievitch drink a great deal " she say " that is   how do he drink " " drink vodka and it ’ bad for he " " and a great deal " whisper levin " yes " she say look timidly towards the doorway where nikolay levin have reappear " what be you talk about " he say knit his brow and turn his scared eye from one to the other " what be it " " oh nothing " konstantin answer in confusion " oh if you do not want to say do not only it ’ no good your talk to she she ’ a wench and you ’re a gentleman " he say with a jerk of the neck " you understand everything I see and have take stock of everything and look with commiseration on my shortcoming " he begin again raise his voice " nikolay dmitrievitch nikolay dmitrievitch " whisper marya nikolaevna again go up to he " oh very well very well but where ’ the supper ah here it be " he say see a waiter with a tray " here set it here " he add angrily and promptly seize the vodka he pour out a glassful and drink it greedily " like a drink " he turn to his brother and at once become well humored " well enough of sergey ivanovitch I ’m glad to see you anyway after all ’ say and do we ’re not stranger come have a drink tell I what you ’re do " he go on greedily munch a piece of bread and pour out another glassful " how be you live " " I live alone in the country as I use to I ’m busy look after the land " answer konstantin watch with horror the greediness with which his brother eat and drink and try to conceal that he notice it " why do n’t you get marry " " it have not happen so " konstantin answer redden a little " why not for I now   everything ’ at an end I ’ve make a mess of my life but this I ’ve say and I say still that if my share have be give I when I need it my whole life would have be different " konstantin make haste to change the conversation " do you know your little vanya ’ with I a clerk in the countinghouse at pokrovskoe " nikolay jerk his neck and sink into thought " yes tell I what ’ go on at pokrovskoe be the house stand still and the birch tree and our schoolroom and philip the gardener be he live how I remember the arbor and the seat now mind and do not alter anything in the house but make haste and get marry and make everything as it use to be again then I ’ll come and see you if your wife be nice " " but come to I now " say levin " how nicely we would arrange it " " I ’d come and see you if I be sure I should not find sergey ivanovitch " " you would not find he there I live quite independently of he " " yes but say what you like you will have to choose between I and he " he say look timidly into his brother ’s face this timidity touch konstantin " if you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject I tell you that in your quarrel with sergey ivanovitch I take neither side you ’re both wrong you ’re more wrong externally and he inwardly " " ah ah you see that you see that " nikolay shout joyfully " but I personally value friendly relation with you more because " " why why " konstantin could not say that he value it more because nikolay be unhappy and need affection but nikolay know that this be just what he mean to say and scowl he take up the vodka again " enough nikolay dmitrievitch " say marya nikolaevna stretch out her plump bare arm towards the decanter " let it be do not insist I ’ll beat you " he shout marya nikolaevna smile a sweet and goodhumored smile which be at once reflect on nikolay ’s face and she take the bottle " and do you suppose she understand nothing " say nikolay " she understand it all well than any of we be not it true there ’ something good and sweet in she " " be you never before in moscow " konstantin say to she for the sake of say something " only you must not be polite and stiff with she it frighten she no one ever speak to she so but the justice of the peace who try she for try to get out of a house of illfame mercy on we the senselessness in the world " he cry suddenly " these new institution these justice of the peace rural councils what hideousness it all be " and he begin to enlarge on his encounter with the new institution konstantin levin hear he and the disbelief in the sense of all public institution which he share with he and often express be distasteful to he now from his brother ’s lip " in another world we shall understand it all " he say lightly " in another world ah I do not like that other world I do not like it " he say let his scared eye rest on his brother ’s eye " here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess one ’s own and other people ’s would be a good thing and yet I ’m afraid of death awfully afraid of death " he shudder " but do drink something would you like some champagne or shall we go somewhere let ’s go to the gypsy do you know I have get so fond of the gypsy and russian song " his speech have begin to falter and he pass abruptly from one subject to another konstantin with the help of masha persuade he not to go out anywhere and get he to bed hopelessly drunk masha promise to write to konstantin in case of need and to persuade nikolay levin to go and stay with his brother in the morning konstantin levin leave moscow and towards evening he reach home on the journey in the train he talk to his neighbor about politic and the new railway and just as in moscow he be overcome by a sense of confusion of idea dissatisfaction with himself shame of something or other but when he get out at his own station when he see his oneeyed coachman ignat with the collar of his coat turn up when in the dim light reflect by the station fire he see his own sledge his own horse with their tail tie up in their harness trim with ring and tassel when the coachman ignat as he put in his luggage tell he the village news that the contractor have arrive and that pava have calve — he feel that little by little the confusion be clear up and the shame and selfdissatisfaction be pass away he feel this at the mere sight of ignat and the horse but when he have put on the sheepskin bring for he have sit down wrap up in the sledge and have drive off ponder on the work that lie before he in the village and stare at the sidehorse that have be his saddlehorse past his prime now but a spirited beast from the don he begin to see what have happen to he in quite a different light he feel himself and do not want to be anyone else all he want now be to be well than before in the first place he resolve that from that day he would give up hope for any extraordinary happiness such as marriage must have give he and consequently he would not so disdain what he really have secondly he would never again let himself give way to low passion the memory of which have so torture he when he have be make up his mind to make an offer then remember his brother nikolay he resolve to himself that he would never allow himself to forget he that he would follow he up and not lose sight of he so as to be ready to help when thing should go ill with he and that would be soon he feel then too his brother ’s talk of communism which he have treat so lightly at the time now make he think he consider a revolution in economic condition nonsense but he always feel the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasant and now he determine that so as to feel quite in the right though he have work hard and live by no mean luxuriously before he would now work still hard and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seem to he so easy a conquest over himself that he spend the whole drive in the pleasant daydream with a resolute feeling of hope in a new well life he reach home before nine o’clock at night the snow of the little quadrangle before the house be light up by a light in the bedroom window of his old nurse agafea mihalovna who perform the duty of housekeeper in his house she be not yet asleep kouzma wake up by she come sidle sleepily out onto the step a setter bitch laska run out too almost upset kouzma and whine turn round about levin ’s knee jump up and long but not dare to put her forepaw on his chest " you ’re soon back again sir " say agafea mihalovna " I get tired of it agafea mihalovna with friend one be well but at home one be well " he answer and go into his study the study be slowly light up as the candle be bring in the familiar detail come out the stag ’s horn the bookshelf the lookingglass the stove with its ventilator which have long want mend his father ’s sofa a large table on the table an open book a broken ashtray a manuscript book with his handwriting as he see all this there come over he for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arrange the new life of which he have be dream on the road all these trace of his life seem to clutch he and to say to he " no you ’re not go to get away from we and you ’re not go to be different but you ’re go to be the same as you ’ve always be with doubt everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself vain effort to amend and fall and everlasting expectation of a happiness which you will not get and which be not possible for you " this the thing say to he but another voice in his heart be tell he that he must not fall under the sway of the past and that one can do anything with oneself and hear that voice he go into the corner where stand his two heavy dumbbell and begin brandish they like a gymnast try to restore his confident temper there be a creak of step at the door he hastily put down the dumbbell the bailiff come in and say everything thank god be do well but inform he that the buckwheat in the new dry machine have be a little scorched this piece of news irritate levin the new dry machine have be construct and partly invent by levin the bailiff have always be against the drying machine and now it be with suppress triumph that he announce that the buckwheat have be scorch levin be firmly convince that if the buckwheat have be scorch it be only because the precaution have not be take for which he have hundred of time give order he be annoy and reprimand the bailiff but there have be an important and joyful event pava his good cow an expensive beast buy at a show have calve " kouzma give I my sheepskin and you tell they to take a lantern I ’ll come and look at she " he say to the bailiff the cowhouse for the more valuable cow be just behind the house walk across the yard pass a snowdrift by the lilac tree he go into the cowhouse there be the warm steamy smell of dung when the frozen door be open and the cow astonish at the unfamiliar light of the lantern stir on the fresh straw he catch a glimpse of the broad smooth black and piebald back of hollandka berkoot the bull be lie down with his ring in his lip and seem about to get up but think well of it and only give two snort as they pass by he pava a perfect beauty huge as a hippopotamus with her back turn to they prevent their see the calf as she sniff she all over levin go into the pen look pava over and lift the red and spotted calf onto her long totter leg pava uneasy begin low but when levin put the calf close to she she be soothe and sigh heavily begin lick she with her rough tongue the calf fumble poke her nose under her mother ’s udder and stiffen her tail out straight " here bring the light fyodor this way " say levin examine the calf " like the mother though the color take after the father but that ’ nothing very good long and broad in the haunch vassily fedorovitch be not she splendid " he say to the bailiff quite forgive he for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf " how could she fail to be oh semyon the contractor come the day after you leave you must settle with he konstantin dmitrievitch " say the bailiff " I do inform you about the machine " this question be enough to take levin back to all the detail of his work on the estate which be on a large scale and complicated he go straight from the cowhouse to the counting house and after a little conversation with the bailiff and semyon the contractor he go back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawingroom the house be big and oldfashioned and levin though he live alone have the whole house heat and use he know that this be stupid he know that it be positively not right and contrary to his present new plan but this house be a whole world to levin it be the world in which his father and mother have live and die they have live just the life that to levin seem the ideal of perfection and that he have dream of begin with his wife his family levin scarcely remember his mother his conception of she be for he a sacred memory and his future wife be bind to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite holy ideal of a woman that his mother have be he be so far from conceive of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively picture to himself first the family and only secondarily the woman who would give he a family his idea of marriage be consequently quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintance for whom get marry be one of the numerous fact of social life for levin it be the chief affair of life on which its whole happiness turn and now he have to give up that when he have go into the little drawingroom where he always have

sleepingcarriage " thank god tomorrow I shall see seryozha and alexey alexandrovitch and my life will go on in the old you all nice and as usual " still in the same anxious frame of mind as she have be all that day anna take pleasure in arrange herself for the journey with great care with her little deft hand she open and shut her little red bag take out a cushion lay it on her knee and carefully wrap up her foot settle herself comfortably an invalid lady have already lie down to sleep two other lady begin talk to anna and a stout elderly lady tuck up her foot and make observation about the heating of the train anna answer a few word but not foresee any entertainment from the conversation she ask annushka to get a lamp hook it onto the arm of her seat and take from her bag a paperknife and an english novel at first her reading make no progress the fuss and bustle be disturbing then when the train have start she could not help listen to the noise then the snow beat on the left window and stick to the pane and the sight of the muffled guard pass by cover with snow on one side and the conversation about the terrible snowstorm rage outside distract her attention far on it be continually the same again and again the same shaking and rattle the same snow on the window the same rapid transition from steam heat to cold and back again to heat the same pass glimpse of the same figure in the twilight and the same voice and anna begin to read and to understand what she read annushka be already doze the red bag on her lap clutch by her broad hand in glove of which one be tear anna arkadyevna read and understand but it be distasteful to she to read that be to follow the reflection of other people ’s life she have too great a desire to live herself if she read that the heroine of the novel be nurse a sick man she long to move with noiseless step about the room of a sick man if she read of a member of parliament make a speech she long to be deliver the speech if she read of how lady mary have ride after the hound and have provoke her sisterinlaw and have surprise everyone by her boldness she too wish to be do the same but there be no chance of do anything and twist the smooth paperknife in her little hand she force herself to read the hero of the novel be already almost reach his english happiness a baronetcy and an estate and anna be feel a desire to go with he to the estate when she suddenly feel that he ought to feel ashamed and that she be ashamed of the same thing but what have he to be ashamed of " what have I to be ashamed of " she ask herself in injured surprise she lay down the book and sink against the back of the chair tightly grip the papercutter in both hand there be nothing she go over all her moscow recollection all be good pleasant she remember the ball remember vronsky and his face of slavish adoration remember all her conduct with he there be nothing shameful and for all that at the same point in her memory the feeling of shame be intensify as though some inner voice just at the point when she think of vronsky be say to she " warm very warm hot " " well what be it " she say to herself resolutely shift her seat in the lounge " what do it mean be I afraid to look it straight in the face why what be it can it be that between I and this officer boy there exist or can exist any other relation than such as be common with every acquaintance " she laugh contemptuously and take up her book again but now she be definitely unable to follow what she read she pass the paperknife over the window pane then lay its smooth cool surface to her cheek and almost laugh aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause come over she she feel as though her nerve be string be strain tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg she feel her eye open wider and wider her finger and toe twitch nervously something within oppress her breathing while all shape and sound seem in the uncertain halflight to strike she with unaccustomed vividness moment of doubt be continually come upon she when she be uncertain whether the train be go forwards or backwards or be stand still altogether whether it be annushka at her side or a stranger " what ’ that on the arm of the chair a fur cloak or some beast and what be I myself myself or some other woman " she be afraid of give way to this delirium but something draw she towards it and she could yield to it or resist it at will she get up to rouse herself and slip off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress for a moment she regain her selfpossession and realize that the thin peasant who have come in wear a long overcoat with button miss from it be the stoveheater that he be look at the thermometer that it be the wind and snow burst in after he at the door but then everything grow blurred again that peasant with the long waist seem to be gnaw something on the wall the old lady begin stretch her leg the whole length of the carriage and fill it with a black cloud then there be a fearful shrieking and banging as though someone be be tear to piece then there be a blind dazzle of red fire before her eye and a wall seem to rise up and hide everything anna feel as though she be sink down but it be not terrible but delightful the voice of a man muffle up and cover with snow shout something in her ear she get up and pull herself together she realize that they have reach a station and that this be the guard she ask annushka to hand she the cape she have take off and her shawl put they on and move towards the door " do you wish to get out " ask annushka " yes I want a little air it ’ very hot in here " and she open the door the drive snow and the wind rush to meet she and struggle with she over the door but she enjoy the struggle she open the door and go out the wind seem as though lie in wait for she with gleeful whistle it try to snatch she up and bear she off but she cling to the cold door post and hold her skirt get down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriage the wind have be powerful on the step but on the platform under the lee of the carriage there be a lull with enjoyment she draw deep breath of the frozen snowy air and stand near the carriage look about the platform and the lighted station the rage tempest rush whistle between the wheel of the carriage about the scaffolding and round the corner of the station the carriage post people everything that be to be see be cover with snow on one side and be get more and more thickly cover for a moment there would come a lull in the storm but then it would swoop down again with such onslaught that it seem impossible to stand against it meanwhile man run to and fro talk merrily together their step crackle on the platform as they continually open and close the big door the bent shadow of a man glide by at her foot and she hear sound of a hammer upon iron " hand over that telegram " come an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side " this way no 28 " several different voice shout again and muffled figure run by cover with snow two gentleman with lighted cigarette pass by she she draw one more deep breath of the fresh air and have just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage when another man in a military overcoat quite close beside she step between she and the flicker light of the lamp post she look round and the same instant recognize vronsky ’s face put his hand to the peak of his cap he bow to she and ask be there anything she want could he be of any service to she she gaze rather a long while at he without answer and in spite of the shadow in which he be stand she see or fancy she see both the expression of his face and his eye it be again that expression of reverential ecstasy which have so work upon she the day before more than once she have tell herself during the past few day and again only a few moment before that vronsky be for she only one of the hundred of young man forever exactly the same that be meet everywhere that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon he but now at the first instant of meet he she be seize by a feeling of joyful pride she have no need to ask why he have come she know as certainly as if he have tell she that he be here to be where she be " I do not know you be go what be you come for " she say let fall the hand with which she have grasp the door post and irrepressible delight and eagerness shine in her face " what be I come for " he repeat look straight into her eye " you know that I have come to be where you be " he say " I can not help it " at that moment the wind as it be surmount all obstacle send the snow fly from the carriage roof and clank some sheet of iron it have tear off while the hoarse whistle of the engine roar in front plaintively and you all the awfulness of the storm seem to she more splendid now he have say what her soul long to hear though she fear it with her reason she make no answer and in her face he see conflict " forgive I if you dislike what I say " he say humbly he have speak courteously deferentially yet so firmly so stubbornly that for a long while she could make no answer " it ’ wrong what you say and I beg you if you ’re a good man to forget what you ’ve say as I forget it " she say at last " not one word not one gesture of yours shall I could I ever forget " " enough enough " she cry try assiduously to give a stern expression to her face into which he be gaze greedily and clutch at the cold door post she clamber up the step and get rapidly into the corridor of the carriage but in the little corridor she pause go over in her imagination what have happen though she could not recall her own word or his she realize instinctively that the momentary conversation have bring they fearfully close and she be panicstricken and blissful at it after stand still a few second she go into the carriage and sit down in her place the overstrained condition which have torment she before do not only come back but be intensify and reach such a pitch that she be afraid every minute that something would snap within she from the excessive tension she do not sleep all night but in that nervous tension and in the vision that fill her imagination there be nothing disagreeable or gloomy on the contrary there be something blissful glow and exhilarating towards morning anna sink into a doze sit in her place and when she wake it be daylight and the train be near petersburg at once thought of home of husband and of son and the detail of that day and the following come upon she at petersburg as soon as the train stop and she get out the first person that attract her attention be her husband " oh mercy why do his ear look like that " she think look at his frigid and imposing figure and especially the ear that strike she at the moment as prop up the brim of his round hat catch sight of she he come to meet she his lip fall into their habitual sarcastic smile and his big tired eye look straight at she an unpleasant sensation grip at her heart when she meet his obstinate and weary glance as though she have expect to see he different she be especially strike by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experience on meet he that feeling be an intimate familiar feeling like a consciousness of hypocrisy which she experience in her relation with her husband but hitherto she have not take note of the feeling now she be clearly and painfully aware of it " yes as you see your tender spouse as devoted as the first year after marriage burn with impatience to see you " he say in his deliberate highpitched voice and in that tone which he almost always take with she a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he say " be seryozha quite well " she ask " and be this all the reward " say he " for my ardor he ’ quite well " vronsky have not even try to sleep all that night he sit in his armchair look straight before he or scan the people who get in and out if he have indeed on previous occasion strike and impress people who do not know he by his air of unhesitating composure he seem now more haughty and selfpossessed than ever he look at people as if they be thing a nervous young man a clerk in a law court sit opposite he hate he for that look the young man ask he for a light and enter into conversation with he and even push against he to make he feel that he be not a thing but a person but vronsky gaze at he exactly as he do at the lamp and the young man make a wry face feeling that he be lose his selfpossession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize he as a person vronsky see nothing and no one he feel himself a king not because he believe that he have make an impression on anna — he do not yet believe that — but because the impression she have make on he give he happiness and pride what would come of it all he do not know he do not even think he feel that all his force hitherto dissipate waste be center on one thing and bend with fearful energy on one blissful goal and he be happy at it he know only that he have tell she the truth that he have come where she be that all the happiness of his life the only meaning in life for he now lie in see and hear she and when he get out of the carriage at bologova to get some seltzer water and catch sight of anna involuntarily his first word have tell she just what he think and he be glad he have tell she it that she know it now and be think of it he do not sleep all night when he be back in the carriage he keep unceasingly go over every position in which he have see she every word she have utter and before his fancy make his heart faint with emotion float picture of a possible future when he get out of the train at petersburg he feel after his sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath he pause near his compartment wait for she to get out " once more " he say to himself smile unconsciously " once more I shall see she walk her face she will say something turn her head glance smile maybe " but before he catch sight of she he see her husband whom the stationmaster be deferentially escort through the crowd " ah yes the husband " only now for the first time do vronsky realize clearly the fact that there be a person attach to she a husband he know that she have a husband but have hardly believe in his existence and only now fully believe in he with his head and shoulder and his leg clothe in black trouser especially when he see this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property see alexey alexandrovitch with his petersburg face and severely selfconfident figure in his round hat with his rather prominent spine he believe in he and be aware of a disagreeable sensation such as a man might feel torture by thirst who on reach a spring should find a dog a sheep or a pig who have drink of it and muddy the water alexey alexandrovitch ’s manner of walk with a swing of the hip and flat foot particularly annoy vronsky he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love she but she be still the same and the sight of she affect he the same way physically revive he stir he and fill his soul with rapture he tell his german valet who run up to he from the second class to take his thing and go on and he himself go up to she he see the first meeting between the husband and wife and note with a lover ’s insight the sign of slight reserve with which she speak to her husband " no she do not love he and can not love he " he decide to himself at the moment when he be approach anna arkadyevna he notice too with joy that she be conscious of his be near and look round and see he turn again to her husband " have you pass a good night " he ask bow to she and her husband together and leave it up to alexey alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his own account and to recognize it or not as he might see fit " thank you very good " she answer her face look weary and there be not that play of eagerness in it peep out in her smile and her eye but for a single instant as she glance at he there be a flash of something in her eye and although the flash die away at once he be happy for that moment she glance at her husband to find out whether he know vronsky alexey alexandrovitch look at vronsky with displeasure vaguely recall who this be vronsky ’s composure and selfconfidence here strike like a scythe against a stone upon the cold selfconfidence of alexey alexandrovitch " count vronsky "

laugh show his strong close row of tooth when he think of the helmet have hear all the news vronsky with the assistance of his valet get into his uniform and go off to report himself he intend when he have do that to drive to his brother ’s and to betsy ’s and to pay several visit with a view to begin to go into that society where he might meet madame karenina as he always do in petersburg he leave home not mean to return till late at night at the end of the winter in the shtcherbatskys ' house a consultation be be hold which be to pronounce on the state of kitty ’s health and the measure to be take to restore her fail strength she have be ill and as spring come on she grow bad the family doctor give she cod liver oil then iron then nitrate of silver but as the first and the second and the third be alike in do no good and as his advice when spring come be to go abroad a celebrated physician be call in the celebrated physician a very handsome man still youngish ask to examine the patient he maintain with peculiar satisfaction it seem that maiden modesty be a mere relic of barbarism and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still youngish to handle a young girl naked he think it natural because he do it every day and feel and think as it seem to he no harm as he do it and consequently he consider modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of barbarism but also as an insult to himself there be nothing for it but to submit since although all the doctor have study in the same school have read the same book and learn the same science and though some people say this celebrated doctor be a bad doctor in the princess ’s household and circle it be for some reason accept that this celebrate doctor alone have some special knowledge and that he alone could save kitty after a careful examination and sounding of the bewildered patient daze with shame the celebrate doctor have scrupulously wash his hand be stand in the drawingroom talk to the prince the prince frown and cough listen to the doctor as a man who have see something of life and neither a fool nor an invalid he have no faith in medicine and in his heart be furious at the whole farce specially as he be perhaps the only one who fully comprehend the cause of kitty ’s illness " conceite blockhead " he think as he listen to the celebrated doctor ’s chatter about his daughter ’s symptom the doctor be meantime with difficulty restrain the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman and with difficulty condescend to the level of his intelligence he perceive that it be no good talk to the old man and that the principal person in the house be the mother before she he decide to scatter his pearl at that instant the princess come into the drawingroom with the family doctor the prince withdraw try not to show how ridiculous he think the whole performance the princess be distract and do not know what to do she feel she have sin against kitty " well doctor decide our fate " say the princess " tell I everything " " be there hope " she mean to say but her lip quiver and she could not utter the question " well doctor " " immediately princess I will talk it over with my colleague and then I will have the honor of lay my opinion before you " " so we have well leave you " " as you please " the princess go out with a sigh when the doctor be leave alone the family doctor begin timidly explain his opinion that there be a commencement of tuberculous trouble but   and so on the celebrated doctor listen to he and in the middle of his sentence look at his big gold watch " yes " say he " but " the family doctor respectfully cease in the middle of his observation " the commencement of the tuberculous process we be not as you be aware able to define till there be cavity there be nothing definite but we may suspect it and there be indication malnutrition nervous excitability and so on the question stand thus in presence of indication of tuberculous process what be to be do to maintain nutrition " " but you know there be always moral spiritual cause at the back in these case " the family doctor permit himself to interpolate with a subtle smile " yes that ’ an understood thing " respond the celebrated physician again glance at his watch " beg pardon be the yausky bridge do yet or shall I have to drive around " he ask " ah it be oh well then I can do it in twenty minute so we be say the problem may be put thus to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerve the one be in close connection with the other one must attack both side at once " " and how about a tour abroad " ask the family doctor " I ’ve no liking for foreign tour and take note if there be an early stage of tuberculous process of which we can not be certain a foreign tour will be of no use what be want be mean of improve nutrition and not for lower it " and the celebrated doctor expound his plan of treatment with soden waters a remedy obviously prescribe primarily on the ground that they could do no harm the family doctor listen attentively and respectfully " but in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habit the removal from condition call up reminiscence and then the mother wish it " he add " ah well in that case to be sure let they go only those german quack be mischievous they ought to be persuade well let they go then " he glance once more at his watch " oh time ’ up already " and he go to the door the celebrated doctor announce to the princess a feeling of what be due from he dictate his do so that he ought to see the patient once more " what another examination " cry the mother with horror " oh no only a few detail princess " " come this way " and the mother accompany by the doctor go into the drawingroom to kitty waste and flush with a peculiar glitter in her eye leave there by the agony of shame she have be put through kitty stand in the middle of the room when the doctor come in she flush crimson and her eye fill with tear all her illness and treatment strike she as a thing so stupid ludicrous even doctor she seem to she as absurd as put together the piece of a broken vase her heart be break why would they try to cure she with pill and powder but she could not grieve her mother especially as her mother consider herself to blame " may I trouble you to sit down princess " the celebrated doctor say to she he sit down with a smile face she feel her pulse and again begin ask she tiresome question she answer he and all at once get up furious " excuse I doctor but there be really no object in this this be the third time you ’ve ask I the same thing " the celebrated doctor do not take offense " nervous irritability " he say to the princess when kitty have leave the room " however I have finish " and the doctor begin scientifically explain to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and conclude by insist on the drinking of the water which be certainly harmless at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunge into deep meditation as though resolve a weighty problem finally his decision be pronounce they be to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quack and to apply to he in any need it seem as though some piece of good fortune have come to pass after the doctor have go the mother be much more cheerful when she go back to her daughter and kitty pretend to be more cheerful she have often almost always to be pretend now " really I ’m quite well mamma but if you want to go abroad let ’s go " she say and try to appear interested in the propose tour she begin talk of the preparation for the journey soon after the doctor dolly have arrive she know that there be to be a consultation that day and though she be only just up after her confinement she have another baby a little girl bear at the end of the winter though she have trouble and anxiety enough of her own she have leave her tiny baby and a sick child to come and hear kitty ’s fate which be to be decide that day " well well " she say come into the drawingroom without take off her hat " you ’re all in good spirit good news then " they try to tell she what the doctor have say but it appear that though the doctor have talk distinctly enough and at great length it be utterly impossible to report what he have say the only point of interest be that it be settle they should go abroad dolly could not help sigh her dear friend her sister be go away and her life be not a cheerful one her relation with stepan arkadyevitch after their reconciliation have become humiliating the union anna have cement turn out to be of no solid character and family harmony be break down again at the same point there have be nothing definite but stepan arkadyevitch be hardly ever at home money too be hardly ever forthcoming and dolly be continually torture by suspicion of infidelity which she try to dismiss dread the agony of jealousy she have be through already the first onslaught of jealousy once live through could never come back again and even the discovery of infidelity could never now affect she as it have the first time such a discovery now would only mean break up family habit and she let herself be deceive despise he and still more herself for the weakness besides this the care of her large family be a constant worry to she first the nursing of her young baby do not go well then the nurse have go away now one of the child have fall ill " well how be all of you " ask her mother " ah mamma we have plenty of trouble of our own lili be ill and I ’m afraid it ’ scarlatina I have come

fancy that his love give he insight when now her glance meet his blue kindly eye look intently at she it seem to she that he see right through she and understand all that be not good that be pass within she redden she stretch out towards he expect a kiss but he only pat her hair and say " these stupid chignon there ’ no get at the real daughter one simply stroke the bristle of dead woman well dolinka " he turn to his eld daughter " what ’ your young buck about hey " " nothing father " answer dolly understand that her husband be mean " he ’ always out I scarcely ever see he " she could not

listen to the princess ’s scolding rather a long while without speak but his face be more and more frowning " she ’ so much to be pity poor child so much to be pity and you do not feel how it hurt she to hear the slight reference to the cause of it ah to be so mistaken in people " say the princess and by the change in her tone both dolly and the prince know she be speak of vronsky " I do not know why there be not law against such base dishonorable people " " ah I can not bear to hear you " say the prince gloomily get up from his low chair and seem anxious to get away yet stop in the doorway "

yes if there have be nothing that ought not to have be old as I be I ’d have call he out to the barrier the young dandy yes and now you physic she and call in these quack " the prince apparently have plenty more to say but as soon as the princess hear his tone she subside at once and become penitent as she always do on serious occasion " alexander alexander " she whisper move to he and begin to weep as soon as she begin to cry the prince too calm down he go up to she " there that ’ enough that ’ enough you ’re wretched too I know it can not be help there ’ no great harm do god be merciful   thank " he say not know what he be say as he respond to the tearful kiss of the princess that he feel on his hand and the prince go out of the room before this as soon as kitty go out of the room in

prepare for action while her mother be attack her father she try to restrain her mother so far as filial reverence would allow during the prince ’s outburst she be silent she feel ashamed for her mother and tender towards her father for so quickly be kind again but when her father leave they she make ready for what be the chief thing needful — to go to kitty and console she " I ’d be mean to tell you something for a long while mamma do you know that levin mean to make kitty an offer when he be here the last time he tell stiva so " " well what then I do not understand " " so do kitty

levin and she would not have refuse he if it have not be for the other I know and then he have deceive she so horribly " it be too terrible for the princess to think how she have sin against her daughter and she break out angrily " oh I really do not understand nowadays they will all go their own way and mother have not a word to say in anything and then " " mamma I ’ll go up to she " " well do do I tell you not to " say her mother when she go into kitty ’s little room a pretty pink little room full of knickknack in vieux saxe as fresh and pink and white and gay as kitty herself have be two month ago dolly remember how they have decorate the room the year before together with what love and gaiety her heart turn cold when she see kitty sit on a low chair near the door her eye fix immovably on a corner of the rug kitty glance at her sister and the cold rather illtempered expression of her face do not change " I ’m just go now and I shall have to keep in and you will not be able to come to see I " say dolly sit down beside she " I want to talk to you " " what about " kitty ask swiftly lift her head in dismay " what should it be but your trouble " " I have no trouble " " nonsense kitty do you suppose I could help know I know all about it and believe I it ’ of so little consequence we ’ve all be through it " kitty do not speak and her face have a stern expression " he ’ not worth your grieve over he " pursue darya alexandrovna come straight to the point " no because he have treat I with contempt " say kitty in a break voice " do not talk of it please do not talk of it " " but who can have tell you so no one have say that I ’m certain he be in love with you and would still be in love with you if it have not " " oh the most awful thing of all for I be this sympathizing " shriek kitty suddenly fly into a passion she turn round on her chair flush crimson and rapidly move her finger pinch the clasp of her belt first with one hand and then with the other dolly know this trick her sister have of clench her hand when she be much excited she know too that in moment of excitement kitty be capable of forget herself and say a great deal too much and dolly would have soothe she but it be too late " what what be it you want to make I feel eh " say kitty quickly " that I ’ve be in love with a man who do not care a straw for I and that I ’m die of love for he and this be say to I by my own sister who imagine that   that   that she ’ sympathize with I I do not want these condolence and humbug " " kitty you ’re unjust " " why be you torment I " " but I   quite the contrary   I see you ’re unhappy " but kitty in her fury do not hear she " I ’ve nothing to grieve over and be comfort about I be too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who do not love I " " yes I do not say so either only one thing tell I the truth " say darya alexandrovna take she by the hand " tell I do levin speak to you " the mention of levin ’s name seem to deprive kitty of the last vestige of selfcontrol she leap up from her chair and fling her clasp on the ground she gesticulate rapidly with her hand and say " why bring levin in too I can not understand what you want to torment I for I ’ve tell you and I say it again that I have some pride and never never would I do as you ’re do — go back to a man who ’ deceive you who have care for another woman I can not understand it you may but I can not " and say these word she glance at her sister and see that dolly sit silent her head mournfully bow kitty instead of run out of the room as she have mean to do sit down near the door and hide her face in her handkerchief the silence last for two minute dolly be think of herself that humiliation of which she be always conscious come back to she with a peculiar bitterness when her sister remind she of it she have not look for such cruelty in her sister and she be angry with she but suddenly she hear the rustle of a skirt and with it the sound of heartrending smother sobbing and feel arm about her neck kitty be on her knee before her " dolinka I be so so wretched " she whisper penitently and the sweet face cover with tear hide itself in darya alexandrovna ’s skirt as though tear be the indispensable oil without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sister the sister after their tear talk not of what be uppermost in their mind but though they talk of outside matter they understand each other kitty know that the word she have utter in anger about her husband ’s infidelity and her humiliating position have cut her poor sister to the heart but that she have forgive her dolly for her part know all she have want to find out she feel certain that her surmise be correct that kitty ’s misery her inconsolable misery be due precisely to the fact that levin have make she an offer and she have refuse he and vronsky have deceive she and that she be fully prepared to love levin and to detest vronsky kitty say not a word of that she talk of nothing but her spiritual condition " I have nothing to make I miserable " she say get calm " but can you understand that everything have become hateful loathsome coarse to I and I myself most of all you can not imagine what loathsome thought I have about everything " " why whatever loathsome thought can you have " ask dolly smile " the most utterly loathsome and coarse I can not tell you it ’ not unhappiness or low spirit but much bad as though everything that be good in I be all hide away and nothing be leave but the most loathsome come how be I to tell you " she go on see the puzzled look in her sister ’s eye " father begin say something to I just now it seem to I he think all I want be to be married mother take I to a ball it seem to I she only take I to get I marry off as soon as may be and be rid of I I know it ’ not the truth but I can not drive away such thought eligible suitor as they call they — I can not bear to see they it seem to I they ’re take stock of I and sum I up in old day to go anywhere in a ball dress be a simple joy to I I admire myself now I feel ashamed and awkward and then the doctor then " kitty hesitate she want to say far that ever since this change have take place in she stepan arkadyevitch have become insufferably repulsive to she and that she could not see he without the gross and most hideous conception rise before her imagination " oh well everything present itself to I in the coarse most loathsome light " she go on " that ’ my illness perhaps it will pass off " " but you must not think about it " " I can not help it I ’m never happy except with the child at your house " " what a pity you can not be with I " " oh yes I ’m come I ’ve have scarlatina and I ’ll persuade mamma to let I " kitty insist on have her way and go to stay at her sister ’s and nurse the child all through the scarlatina for scarlatina it turn out to be the two sister bring all the six child successfully through it but kitty be no well in health and in lent the shtcherbatskys go abroad the high petersburg society be essentially one in it everyone know everyone else everyone even visit everyone else but this great set have its subdivision anna arkadyevna karenina have friend and close tie in three different circle of this high society one circle be her husband ’s government official set consist of his colleague and subordinate bring together in the most various and capricious manner and belong to different social stratum anna find it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awestricken reverence which she have at first entertain for these person now she know all of they as people know one another in a country town she know their habit and weakness and where the shoe pinch each one of they she know their relation with one another and with the head authority know who be for whom and how each one maintain his position and where they agree and disagree but the circle of political masculine interest have never interest she in spite of countess lidia ivanovna ’s influence and she avoid it another little set with which anna be in close relation be the one by mean of which alexey alexandrovitch have make his career the center of this circle be the countess lidia ivanovna it be a set make up of elderly ugly benevolent and godly woman and clever learned and ambitious man one of the clever people belong to the set have call it " the conscience of petersburg society " alexey alexandrovitch have the high esteem for this circle and anna with her special gift for get on with everyone have in the early day of her life in petersburg make friend in this circle also now since her return from moscow she have come to feel this set insufferable it seem to she that both she and all of they be insincere and she feel so bored and ill at ease in that world that she go to see the countess lidia ivanovna as little as possible the third circle with which anna have tie be preeminently the fashionable world — the world of ball of dinner of sumptuous dress the world that hang on to the court with one hand so as to avoid sink to the level of the demimonde for the demimonde the member of that fashionable world believe that they despise though their taste be not merely similar but in fact identical her connection with this circle be keep up through princess betsy tverskaya her cousin ’s wife who have an income of a hundred and twenty thousand rouble and who have take a great fancy to anna ever since she first come out show she much attention and draw she into her set make fun of countess lidia ivanovna ’s coterie " when I ’m old and ugly I ’ll be the same " betsy use to say " but for a pretty young woman like you it ’ early day for that house of

room even the princess myakaya and betsy herself look several time in the direction of the two who have withdraw from the general circle as though that be a disturbing fact alexey alexandrovitch be the only person who do not once look in that direction and be not divert from the interesting discussion he have enter upon notice the disagreeable impression that be be make on everyone princess betsy slip someone else into her place to listen to alexey alexandrovitch and go up to anna " I ’m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband ’s language " she say " the most transcendental idea seem to be within my grasp when he ’ speak " " oh yes " say anna radiant with a smile of happiness and not understand a word of what betsy have say she cross over to the big table and take part in the general conversation alexey alexandrovitch after stay half an hour go up to his wife and suggest that they should go home together but she answer not look at he that she be stay to supper alexey alexandrovitch make his bow and withdraw the fat old tatar madame karenina ’s coachman be with difficulty hold one of her pair of gray chill with the cold and rear at the entrance a footman stand open the carriage door the hallporter stand hold open the great door of the house anna arkadyevna with her quick little hand be unfasten the lace of her sleeve catch in the hook of her fur cloak and with bent head listen to the word vronsky murmur as he escort she down " you ’ve say nothing of course and I ask nothing " he be say " but you know that friendship ’ not what I want that

porter and vanish into the carriage her glance the touch of her hand set he aflame he kiss the palm of his hand where she have touch it and go home happy in the sense that he have get near to the attainment of his aim that evening than during the last two month alexey alexandrovitch have see nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife be sit with vronsky at a table apart in eager conversation with he about something but he notice that to the rest of the party this appear something striking and improper and for that reason it seem to he too to be improper he make up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife on reach home alexey alexandrovitch go to his study as he usually do seat himself in his low chair open a book on the papacy at the place where he have lay the paperknife in it and read till one o’clock just as he usually do but from time to time he rub his high forehead and shake his head as though to drive away something at his usual time he get up and made his toilet for the night anna arkadyevna have not yet come in with a book under his arm he go upstairs but this evening instead of his usual thought and meditation upon official detail his thought be absorb by his wife and something disagreeable connect with she contrary to his usual habit he do not get into bed but fall to walk up and down the room with his hand clasp behind his back he could not go to bed feel that it be absolutely needful for he first to think thoroughly over the position that have just arise when alexey alexandrovitch have make up his mind that he must talk to his wife about it it have seem a very easy and simple matter but now when he begin to think over the question that have just present itself it seem to he very complicated and difficult alexey alexandrovitch be not jealous jealousy accord to his notion be an insult to one ’s wife and one ought to have confidence in one ’s wife why one ought to have confidence — that be to say complete conviction that his young wife would always love he — he do not ask himself but he have no experience of lack of confidence because he have confidence in she and tell himself that he ought to have it now though his conviction that jealousy be a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence have not break down he feel that he be stand face to face with something illogical and irrational and do not know what be to be do alexey alexandrovitch be stand face to face with life with the possibility of his wife ’s love someone other than himself and this seem to he very irrational and incomprehensible because it be life itself all his life alexey alexandrovitch have live and work in official sphere have to do with the reflection of life and every time he have stumble against life itself he have shrink away from it now he experience a feeling akin to that of a man who while calmly cross a precipice by a bridge should suddenly discover that the bridge be break and that there be a chasm below that chasm be life itself the bridge that artificial life in which alexey alexandrovitch have live for the first time the question present itself to he of the possibility of his wife ’s love someone else and he be horrified at it he do not undress but walk up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the diningroom where one lamp be burn over the carpet of the dark drawingroom in which the light be reflect on the big new portrait of himself hang over the sofa and across her boudoir where two candle burn light up the portrait of her parent and woman friend and the pretty knickknack of her writingtable that he know so well he walk across her boudoir to the bedroom door and turn back again at each turn in his walk especially at the parquet of the lighted diningroom he halt and say to himself " yes this I must decide and put a stop to I must express my view of it and my decision " and he turn back again " but express what — what decision " he say to himself in the drawingroom and he find no reply " but after all " he ask himself before turn into the boudoir " what have occur nothing she be talk a long while with he but what of that surely woman in society can talk to whom they please and then jealousy mean lower both myself and she " he tell himself as he go into her boudoir but this dictum which have always have such weight with he before have now no weight and no meaning at all and from the bedroom door he turn back again but as he enter the dark drawingroom some inner voice tell he that it be not so and that if other notice it that show that there be something and he say to himself again in the diningroom " yes I must decide and put a stop to it and express my view of it " and again at the turn in the drawingroom he ask himself " decide how " and again he ask himself " what have occur " and answer " nothing " and recollect that jealousy be a feeling insulting to his wife but again in the drawingroom he be convinced that something have happen his thought like his body go round a complete circle without come upon anything new he notice this rub his forehead and sit down in her boudoir there look at her table with the malachite blotting case lie at the top and an unfinished letter his thought suddenly change he begin to think of she of what she be think and feel for the first time he picture vividly to himself her personal life her idea her desire and the idea that she could and should have a separate life of her own seem to he so alarming that he make haste to dispel it it be the chasm which he be afraid to peep into to put himself in thought and feeling in another person ’s place be a spiritual exercise not natural to alexey alexandrovitch he look on this spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy " and the bad of it all " think he " be that just now at the very moment when my great work be approach completion " he be think of the project he be bring forward at the time " when I stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energy just now this stupid worry should fall foul of I but what ’ to be do I ’m not one of those man who submit to uneasiness and worry without have the force of character to face they " I must think it over come to a decision and put it out of my mind " he say aloud " the question of her feeling of what have pass and may be pass in her soul that ’ not my affair that ’ the affair of her conscience and fall under the head of religion " he say to himself feel consolation in the sense that he have find to which division of regulate principle this new circumstance could be properly refer " and so " alexey alexandrovitch say to himself " question as to her feeling and so on be question for her conscience with which I can have nothing to do my duty be clearly define as the head of the family I be a person bind in duty to guide she and consequently in part the person responsible I be bind to point out the danger I perceive to warn she even to use my authority I ought to speak plainly to she " and everything that he would say tonight to his wife take clear shape in alexey alexandrovitch ’s head think over what he would say he somewhat regret that he should have to use his time and mental power for domestic consumption with so little to show for it but in spite of that the form and content of the speech before he shape itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report " I must say and express fully the follow point first exposition of the value to be attach to public opinion and to decorum secondly exposition of religious significance of marriage thirdly if need be reference to the calamity possibly ensue to our son fourthly reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself " and interlace his finger alexey alexandrovitch stretch they and the joint of the finger crack this trick a bad habit the cracking of his finger always soothe he and give precision to his thought so needful to he at this juncture there be the sound of a carriage drive up to the front door alexey alexandrovitch halt in the middle of the room a woman ’s step be hear mount the stair alexey alexandrovitch ready for his speech stand compress his cross finger wait to see if the crack would not come again one joint crack already from the sound of light step on the stair he be aware that she be close and though he be satisfied with his speech he feel frightened of the explanation confront he anna come in with hang head play with the tassel of her hood her face be brilliant and glow but this glow be not one of brightness it suggest the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night on see her husband anna raise her head and smile as though she have just wake up " you ’re not in bed what a wonder " she say let fall her hood and without stop she go on into the dressingroom " it ’ late alexey alexandrovitch " she say when she have go through the doorway " anna it ’ necessary for I to have a talk with you " " with I " she say wonderingly she come out from behind the door of the dressingroom and look at he " why what be it what about " she ask sit down " well let ’s talk if it ’ so necessary but it would be well to get to sleep " anna say what come to her lip and marvel hear herself at her own capacity for lie how simple and natural be her word and how likely that she be simply sleepy she feel herself clothe in an impenetrable armor of falsehood she feel that some unseen force have come to her aid and be support she " anna I must warn you " he begin " warn I " she say " of what " she look at he so simply so brightly that anyone who do not know she as her husband know she could not have notice anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her word but to he know she know that whenever he go to bed five minute later than usual she notice it and ask he the reason to he know that every joy every pleasure and pain that she feel she communicate to he at once to he now to see that she do not care to notice his state of mind that she do not care to say a word about herself mean a great deal he see that the inmost recess of her soul that have always hitherto lie open before he be close against he more than that he see from her tone that she be not even perturbed at that but as it be say straight out to he " yes it ’ shut up and so it must be and will be in future " now he experience a feeling such as a man might have return home and find his own house lock up " but perhaps the key may yet be find " think alexey alexandrovitch " I want to warn you " he say in a low voice " that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talk about in society your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky " he enunciate the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis " attract attention " he talk and look at her laugh eye which frighten he now with their impenetrable look and as he talk he feel all the uselessness and idleness of his word " you ’re always like that " she answer as though completely misapprehend he and of all he have say only take in the last phrase " one time you do not like my be dull and another time you do not like my be lively I be not dull do that offend you " alexey alexandrovitch shiver and bend his hand to make the joint crack " oh please do not do that I do so dislike it " she say " anna be this you " say alexey alexandrovitch quietly make an effort over himself and restrain the motion of his finger " but what be it all about " she say with such genuine and droll wonder " what do you want of I " alexey alexandrovitch pause and rub his forehead and his eye he see that instead of do as he have intend — that be to say warn his wife against a mistake in the eye of the world — he have unconsciously become agitated over what be the affair of her conscience and be struggle against the barrier he fancy between they " this be what I mean to say to you " he go on coldly and composedly " and I beg you to listen to it I consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and I shall never allow myself to be influence by it but there be certain rule of decorum which can not be disregard with impunity this evening it be not I observe it but judge by the impression make on the company everyone observe that your conduct and deportment be not altogether what could be desire " " I positively do not understand " say anna shrug her shoulders—“he do not care " she think " but other people notice it and that ’ what upset him”—“you’re not well alexey alexandrovitch " she add and she get up and would have go towards the door but he move forward as though he would stop she his face be ugly and forbidding as anna have never see he she stop and bend her head back and on one side begin with her rapid hand take out her hairpin " well I ’m listen to what ’ to come " she say calmly and ironically " and indeed I listen with interest for I should like to understand what ’ the matter " she speak and marvel at the confident calm and natural tone in which she be speak and the choice of the word she use " to enter into all the detail of your feeling I have no right and besides I regard that as useless and even harmful " begin alexey alexandrovitch " ferret in one ’s soul one often ferret out something that might have lie there unnoticed your feeling be an affair of your own conscience but I be in duty bind to you to myself and to god to point out to you your duty our life have be join not by man but by god that union can only be sever by a crime and a crime of that nature bring its own chastisement " " I do not understand a word and oh dear how sleepy I be unluckily " she say rapidly pass her hand through her hair feel for the remain hairpin " anna for god ’s sake do not speak like that " he say gently " perhaps I be mistaken but believe I what I say I say as much for myself as for you I be your husband and I love you " for an instant her face fall and the mocking gleam in her eye die away but the word love throw she into revolt again she think " love can he love if he have not hear there be such a thing as love he would never have use the word he do not even know what love be " " alexey alexandrovitch really I do not understand " she say " define what it be you find " " pardon let I you all I have to say I love you but I be not speak of myself the most important person in this matter be our son and yourself it may very well be I repeat that my word seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place it may be that they be call forth by my mistaken impression in that case I beg you to forgive I but if you be conscious yourself of even the small foundation for they then I beg you to think a little and if your heart prompt you to speak out to I " alexey alexandrovitch be unconsciously say something utterly unlike what he have prepare " I have nothing to say and besides " she say hurriedly with difficulty repress a smile " it ’ really time to be in bed " alexey alexandrovitch sigh and without say more go into the bedroom when she come into the bedroom he be already in bed his lip be sternly compress and his eye look away from she anna get into her bed and lie expect every minute that he would begin to speak to she again she both fear his speaking and wish for it but he be silent she wait for a long while without move and have forget about he she think of that other she picture he and feel how her heart be flood with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of he suddenly she hear an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexey alexandrovitch seem as it be appal at his own snoring and cease but after an interval of two breathing the snore sound again with a new tranquil rhythm " it ’ late it ’ late " she whisper with a smile a long while she lie not move with open eye whose brilliance she almost fancy she could herself see in the darkness from that time a new life begin for alexey alexandrovitch and for his wife nothing special happen anna go out into society as she have always do be particularly often at princess betsy ’s and meet vronsky everywhere alexey alexandrovitch see this but could do nothing all his effort to draw she into open discussion she confront with a barrier which he could not penetrate make up of a sort of amused perplexity outwardly everything be the same but their inner relation be completely change alexey alexandrovitch a man of great power in the world of politic feel himself helpless in this like an ox with head bend submissively he await the blow which he feel be lift over he every time he begin to think about it he feel that he must try once more that by kindness tenderness and persuasion there be still hope of save she of bring she back to herself and every day he make ready to talk to she but every time he begin talk to she he feel that the spirit of evil and deceit which have take possession of she have possession of he too and he talk to she in a tone quite unlike that in which he have mean to talk involuntarily he talk to she in his habitual tone of jeer at anyone who should say what he be say and in that tone it be impossible to say what need to be say to she that which for vronsky have be almost a whole year the one absorb desire of his life replace all his old desire that which for anna have be an impossible terrible and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss that desire have be fulfil he stand before she pale his low jaw quiver and beseech she to be calm not know how or why " anna anna " he say with a choking voice " anna for pity ’s sake " but the louder he speak the low she drop her once proud and gay now shamestricken head and she bow down and sink from the sofa where she be sit down on the floor at his foot she would have fall on the carpet if he have not hold she " my god forgive I " she say sob press his hand to her bosom she feel so sinful so guilty that nothing be leave she but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness and as now there be no one in her life but he to he she address her prayer for forgiveness look at he she have a physical sense of her humiliation and she could say nothing more he feel what a murderer must feel when he see the body he have rob of life that body rob by he of life be their love the first stage of their love there be something awful and revolting in the memory of what have be buy at this fearful price of shame shame at their spiritual nakedness crush she and infect he but in spite of all the murderer ’s horror before the body of his victim he must hack it to piece hide the body must use what he have gain by his murder and with fury as it be with passion the murderer fall on the body and drag it and hack at it so he cover her face and shoulder with kiss she hold his hand and do not stir " yes these kiss — that be what have be buy by this shame yes and one hand which will always be mine — the hand of my accomplice " she lift up that hand and kiss it he sink on his knee and try to see her face but she hide it and say nothing at last as though make an effort over herself she get up and push he away her face be still as beautiful but it be only the more pitiful for that " all be over " she say " I have nothing but you remember that " " I can never forget what be my whole life for one instant of this happiness " " happiness " she say with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infect he " for pity ’s sake not a word not a word more " she rise quickly and move away from he " not a word more " she repeat and with a look of chill despair incomprehensible to he she part from he she feel that at that moment she could not put into word the sense of shame of rapture and of horror at this step into a new life and she do not want to speak of it to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate word but later too and the next day and the third day she still find no word in which she could express the complexity of her feeling indeed she could not even find thought in which she could clearly think out all that be in her soul she say to herself " no just now I can not think of it later on when I be calm " but this calm for thought never come every time the thought rise of what she have do and what would happen to she and what she ought to do a horror come over she and she drive those thought away " later later " she said—“when I be calm " but in dream when she have no control over her thought her position present itself to she in all its hideous nakedness one dream haunt she almost every night she dream that both be her husband at once that both be lavish caress on she alexey alexandrovitch be weep kiss her hand and say " how happy we be now " and alexey vronsky be there too and he too be her husband and she be marvel that it have once seem impossible to she be explain to they laugh that this be ever so much simple and that now both of they be happy and contented but this dream weigh on she like a nightmare and she awake from it in terror in the early day after his return from moscow whenever levin shudder and grow red remember the disgrace of his rejection he say to himself " this be just how I use to shudder and blush think myself utterly lose when I be pluck in physic and do not get my remove and how I think myself utterly ruin after I have mismanage that affair of my sister ’s that be entrust to I and yet now that year have pass I recall it and wonder that it could distress I so much it will be the same thing too with this trouble time will go by and I shall not mind about this either " but three month have pass and he have not leave off mind about it and it be as painful for he to think of it as it have be those first day he could not be at peace because after dream so long of family life and feel himself so ripe for it he be still not married and be furth than ever from marriage he be painfully conscious himself as be all about he that at his year it be not well for man to be alone he remember how before start for moscow he have once say to his cowman nikolay a simplehearted peasant whom he like talk to " well nikolay I mean to get marry " and how nikolay have promptly answer as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt " and high time too konstantin dmitrievitch " but marriage have now become far off than ever the place be take and whenever he try to imagine any of the girl he know in that place he feel that it be utterly impossible moreover the recollection of the rejection and the part he have play in the affair torture he with shame however often he tell himself that he be in no wise to blame in it that recollection like other humiliating reminiscence of a similar kind make he twinge and blush there have be in his past as in every man ’s action recognize by he as bad for which his conscience ought to have torment he but the memory of these evil action be far from cause he so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscence these wound never heal and with these memory be now range his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have appear to other that evening but time and work do their part bitter memory be more and more cover up by the incident — paltry in his eye but really important — of his country life every week he think less often of kitty he be impatiently look forward to the news that she be marry or just go to be marry hope that such news would like have a tooth out completely cure he meanwhile spring come on beautiful and kindly without the delay and treachery of spring — one of those rare spring in which plant beast and man rejoice alike this lovely spring rouse levin still more and strengthen he in his resolution of renounce all his past and build up his lonely life firmly and independently though many of the plan with which he have return to the country have not be carry out still his most important resolution — that of purity — have be keep by he he be free from that shame which have usually harass he after a fall and he could look everyone straight in the face in february he have receive a letter from marya nikolaevna tell he that his brother nikolay ’s health be get bad but that he would not take advice and in consequence of this letter levin go to moscow to his brother ’s and succeed in persuade he to see a doctor and to go to a wateringplace abroad he succeed so well in persuade his brother and in lend he money for the journey without irritate he that he be satisfied with himself in that matter in addition to his farming which call for special attention in spring and in addition to read levin have begin that winter a work on agriculture the plan of which turn on take into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable datum of the question like the climate and the soil and consequently deduce all the principle of scientific culture not simply from the datum of soil and climate but from the datum of soil climate and a certain unalterable character of the laborer thus in spite of his solitude or in consequence of his solitude his life be exceedingly full only rarely he suffer from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray idea to someone besides agafea mihalovna with she indeed he not infrequently fall into discussion upon physics the theory of agriculture and especially philosophy philosophy be agafea mihalovna ’s favorite subject spring be slow in unfolding for the last few week it have be steadily fine frosty weather in the daytime it thaw in the sun but at night there be even seven degree of frost there be such a frozen surface on the snow that they drive the wagon anywhere off the road easter come in the snow then all of a sudden on easter monday a warm wind spring up storm cloud swoop down and for three day and three night the warm drive rain fall in stream on thursday the wind drop and a thick gray fog brood over the land as though hide the mystery of the transformation that be be work in nature behind the fog there be the flowing of water the cracking and floating of ice the swift rush of turbid foam torrent and on the follow monday in the evening the fog part the storm cloud split up into little curl crest of cloud the sky clear and the real spring have come in the morning the sun rise brilliant and quickly wear away the thin layer of ice that cover the water and all the warm air be quiver with the steam that rise up from the quickened earth the old grass look green and the young grass thrust up its tiny blade the bud of the guelderrose and of the currant and the sticky birchbud be swollen with sap and an explore bee be hum about the golden blossom that stud the willow lark trill unseen above the velvety green field and the icecovered stubbleland peewit wail over the low land and marsh flood by the pool crane and wild goose fly high across the sky utter their spring call the cattle bald in patch where the new hair have not grow yet low in the pasture the bowlegged lamb frisk round their bleat mother nimble child run about the dry path cover with the print of bare foot there be a merry chatter of peasant woman over their linen at the pond and the ring of axis in the yard where the peasant be repair plough and harrow the real spring have come levin put on his big boot and for the first time a cloth jacket instead of his fur cloak and go out to look after his farm step over stream of water that flash in the sunshine and dazzle his eye and tread one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud spring be the time of plan and project and as he come out into the farmyard levin like a tree in spring that know not what form will be take by the young shoot and twig imprison in its swell bud hardly know what undertaking he be go to begin upon now in the farm work that be so dear to he but he feel that he be full of the most splendid plan and project first of all he go to the cattle the cow have be let out into their paddock and their smooth side be already shine with their new sleek spring coat they bask in the sunshine and low to go to the meadow levin gaze admiringly at the cow he know so intimately to the minute detail of their condition and give order for they to be drive out into the meadow and the calf to be let into the paddock the herdsman run gaily to get ready for the meadow the cowherd girl pick up their petticoat run splash through the mud with bare leg still white not yet brown from the sun wave brush wood in their hand chase the calf that frolic in the mirth of spring after admire the young one of that year who be particularly fine — the early calf be the size of a peasant ’s cow and pava ’s daughter at three month old be as big as a yearling — levin give order for a trough to be bring out and for they to be feed in the paddock but it appear that as the paddock have not be use during the winter the hurdle make in the autumn for it be break he send for the carpenter who accord to his order ought to have be at work at the thrash machine but it appear that the carpenter be repair the harrow which ought to have be repair before lent this be very annoying to levin it be annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he have be strive with all his might for so many year the hurdle as he ascertain be not want in winter have be carry to the carthorse ' stable and there broken as they be of light construction only mean for feed calf moreover it be apparent also that the harrow and all the agricultural implement which he have direct to be look over and repair in the winter for which very purpose he have hire three carpenter have not be put into repair and the harrow be be repair when they ought to have be harrow the field levin send for his bailiff but immediately go off himself to look for he the bailiff beam all over like everyone that day in a sheepskin border with astrachan come out of the barn twist a bit of straw in his hand " why be not the carpenter at the thrashing machine " " oh I mean to tell you yesterday the harrow want repair here it ’ time they get to work in the field " " but what be they do in the winter then " " but what do you want the carpenter for " " where be the hurdle for the calf ' paddock " " I order they to be get ready what would you have with those peasant " say the bailiff with a wave of his hand " it ’ not those peasant but this bailiff " say levin get angry " why what do I keep you for " he cry but bethink himself that this would not help matter he stop short in the middle of a sentence and merely sigh " well what do you say can sowing begin " he ask after a pause " behind turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin " " and the clover " " I ’ve send vassily and mishka they ’re sow only I do not know if they ’ll manage to get through it ’ so slushy " " how many acre " " about fifteen " " why not sow all " cry levin that they be only sow the clover on fifteen acre not on all the fortyfive be still more annoying to he clover as he know both from book and from his own experience never do well except when it be sow as early as possible almost in the snow and yet levin could never get this do " there ’ no one to send what would you have with such a set of peasant three have not turn up and there ’ semyon " " well you should have take some man from the thatching " " and so I have as it be " " where be the peasant then " " five be make compôte " which mean compost " four be shift the oats for fear of a touch of mildew konstantin dmitrievitch " levin know very well that " a touch of mildew " mean that his english seed oats be already ruin again they have not do as he have order " why but I tell you during lent to put in pipe " he cry " do not put yourself out we shall get it all do in time " levin wave his hand angrily go into the granary to glance at the oats and then to the stable the oats be not yet spoil but the peasant be carry the oats in spade when they might simply let they slide down into the lower granary and arrange for this to be do and take two workman from there for sow clover levin get over his vexation with the bailiff indeed it be such a lovely day that one could not be angry " ignat " he call to the coachman who with his sleeve tuck up be wash the carriage wheel " saddle I " " which sir " " well let it be kolpik " " yes sir " while they be saddle his horse levin again call up the bailiff who be hang about in sight to make it up with he and begin talk to he about the spring operation before they and his plan for the farm the wagon be to begin cart manure early so as to get all do before the early mowing and the ploughing of the further land to go on without a break so as to let it ripen lie fallow and the mowing to be all do by hire labor not on halfprofits the bailiff listen attentively and obviously make an effort to approve of his employer ’s project but still he have that look levin know so well that always irritate he a look of hopelessness and despondency that look say " that ’ all very well but as god will " nothing mortify levin so much as that tone but it be the tone common to all the bailiff he have ever have they have all take up that attitude to his plan and so now he be not anger by it but mortify and feel all the more roused to struggle against this as it seem elemental force continually range against he for which he could find no other expression than " as god will " " if we can manage it konstantin dmitrievitch " say the bailiff " why ever should not you manage it " " we positively must have another fifteen laborer and they do not turn up there be some here today ask seventy rouble for the summer " levin be silent again he be bring face to face with that oppose force he know that however much they try they could not hire more than forty — thirtyseven perhaps or thirtyeight — laborer for a reasonable sum some forty have be take on and there be no more but still he could not help struggle against it " send to sury to tchefirovka if they do not come we must look for they " " oh I ’ll send to be sure " say vassily fedorovitch despondently " but there be the horse too they ’re not good for much " " we ’ll get some more I know of course " levin add laugh " you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible but this year I ’m not go to let you have thing your own way I ’ll see to everything myself " " why I do not think you take much rest as it be it cheer we up to work under the master ’s eye " " so they ’re sow clover behind the birch dale I ’ll go and have a look at they " he say get on to the little bay cob kolpik who be lead up by the coachman " you can not get across the stream konstantin dmitrievitch " the coachman shout " all right I ’ll go by the forest " and levin ride through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country his good little horse after his long inactivity step out gallantly snort over the pool and ask as it be for guidance if levin have feel happy before in the cattle pen and farmyard he feel happy yet in the open country sway rhythmically with the amble pace of his good little cob drink in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he ride through his forest over the crumble waste snow still leave in part and cover with dissolve track he rejoice over every tree with the moss revive on its bark and the bud swell on its shoot when he come out of the forest in the immense plain before he his grass field stretch in an unbroken carpet of green without one bare place or swamp only spot here and there in the hollow with patch of melt snow he be not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasant ' horse and colt trample down his young grass he tell a peasant he meet to drive they out nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat whom he meet on the way and ask " well ipat shall we soon be sow " " we must get the ploughing do first konstantin dmitrievitch " answer ipat the far he ride the happy he become and plan for the land rise to his mind each well than the last to plant all his field with hedge along the southern border so that the snow should not lie under they to divide they up into six field of arable and three of pasture and hay to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate and to dig a pond and to construct movable pen for the cattle as a means of manure the land and then eight hundred acre of wheat three hundred of potato and four hundred of clover and not one acre exhaust absorb in such dream carefully keep his horse by the hedge so as not to trample his young crop he ride up to the laborer who have be send to sow clover a cart with the seed in it be stand not at the edge but in the middle of the crop and the winter corn have be tear up by the wheel and trample by the horse both the laborer be sit in the hedge probably smoke a pipe together the earth in the cart with which the seed be mix be not crush to powder but crust together or adhere in clod see the master the laborer vassily go towards the cart while mishka set to work sow this be not as it should be but with the laborer levin seldom lose his temper when vassily come up levin tell he to lead the horse to the hedge " it ’ all right sir it ’ll spring up again " respond vassily " please do not argue " say levin " but do as you ’re tell " " yes sir " answer vassily and he take the horse ’s head " what a sow konstantin dmitrievitch " he say hesitate " first rate only it ’ a work to get about you drag a ton of earth on your shoe " " why be it you have earth that ’ not sift " say levin " well we crumble it up " answer vassily take up some seed and roll the earth in his palm vassily be not to blame for their have fill up his cart with unsifted earth but still it be annoying levin have more than once already try a way he know for stifle his anger and turn all that seem dark right again and he try that way now he watch how mishka stride along swinge the huge clod of earth that cling to each foot and get off his horse he take the sieve from vassily and start sow himself " where do you stop " vassily point to the mark with his foot and levin go forward as well he could scatter the seed on the land walking be as difficult as on a bog and by the time levin have end the row he be in a great heat and he stop and give up the sieve to vassily " well master when summer ’ here mind you do not scold I for these row " say vassily " eh " say levin cheerily already feel the effect of his method " why you ’ll see in the summer time it ’ll look different look you where I sow last spring how I do work at it I do my good konstantin dmitrievitch d’ye see as I would for my own father I do not like bad work myself nor would I let another man do it what ’ good for the master ’ good for we too to look out yonder now " say vassily point " it do one ’s heart good " " it ’ a lovely spring vassily " " why it ’ a spring such as the old man do not remember the like of I be up home an old man up there have sow wheat too about an acre of it he be say you would not know it from rye " " have you be sow wheat long " " why sir it be you teach we the year before last you give I two measure we sell about eight bushel and sow a rood " " well mind you crumble up the clod " say levin go towards his horse " and keep an eye on mishka and if there ’ a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre " " humbly thankful we be very well content sir as it be " levin get on his horse and ride towards the field where be last year ’s clover and the one which be plough ready for the spring corn the crop of clover come up in the stubble be magnificent it have survive everything and stand up vividly green through the broken stalk of last year ’s wheat the horse sink in up to the pastern and he draw each hoof with a suck sound out of the halfthawed ground over the ploughland riding be utterly impossible the horse could only keep a foothold where there be ice and in the thaw furrow he sink deep in at each step the ploughland be in splendid condition in a couple of day it would be fit for harrowing and sow everything be capital everything be cheer levin ride back across the stream hope the water would have go down and he do in fact get across and startle two duck " there must be snipe too " he think and just as he reach the turn homeward he meet the forest keeper who confirm his theory about the snipe levin go home at a trot so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening as he ride up to the house in the happy frame of mind levin hear the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house " yes that ’ someone from the railway station " he think " just the time to be here from the moscow train   who could it be what if it ’ brother nikolay he do say ' maybe I ’ll go to the waters or maybe I ’ll come down to you ' " he feel dismayed and vexed for the

be life how splendid it be this be how I should like to live " " why who prevent you " say levin smile " no you ’re a lucky man you ’ve get everything you like you like horse — and you have they dog — you have they shoot — you have it farm — you have it " " perhaps because I rejoice in what I have and do not fret for what I have not " say levin think of kitty stepan arkadyevitch comprehend look at he but say nothing levin be grateful to oblonsky for notice with his neverfaile tact that he dread conversation about the shtcherbatskys and so say nothing about they but now levin be long to find out what be torment he so yet he have not the courage to begin " come tell I how thing be go with you " say levin bethink himself that it be not nice of he to think only of himself stepan arkadyevitch ’s eye sparkle merrily " you do not admit I know that one can be fond of new roll when one have have one ’s ration of bread — to your mind it ’ a crime but I do not count life as life without love " he say take levin ’s question his own way " what be I to do I ’m make that way and really one do so little harm to anyone and give oneself so much pleasure " " what be there something new then " query levin " yes my boy there be there do you see you know the type of ossian ’s woman woman such as one see in dream well these woman be sometimes to be meet in reality   and these woman be terrible woman do not you know be such a subject that however much you study it it ’ always perfectly new " " well then it would be well not to study it " " no some mathematician have say that enjoyment lie in the search for truth not in the find it " levin listen in silence and in spite of all the effort he make he could not in the least enter into the feeling of his friend and understand his sentiment and the charm of study such woman the place fix on for the standshooting be not far above a stream in a little aspen copse on reach the copse levin get out of the trap and lead oblonsky to a corner of a mossy swampy glade already quite free from snow he go back himself to a double birch tree on the other side and lean his gun on the fork of a dead low branch he take off his full overcoat fasten his belt again and work his arm to see if they be free gray old laska who have follow they sit down warily opposite he and prick up her ear the sun be set behind a thick forest and in the glow of sunset the birch tree dot about in the aspen copse stand out clearly with their hang twig and their bud swell almost to burst from the thick part of the copse where the snow still remain come the faint sound of narrow wind thread of water run away tiny bird twitter and now and then flutter from tree to tree in the pause of complete stillness there come the rustle of last year ’s leave stir by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass " imagine one can hear and see the grass grow " levin say to himself notice a wet slatecolored aspen leaf move beside a blade of young grass he stand listen and gaze sometimes down at the wet mossy ground sometimes at laska listen all alert sometimes at the sea of bare tree top that stretch on the slope below he sometimes at the darken sky cover with white streak of cloud a hawk fly high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wing another fly with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanish the bird twitter more and more loudly and busily in the thicket an owl hoot not far off and laska start step cautiously a few step forward and put her head on one side begin to listen intently beyond the stream be hear the cuckoo twice she utter her usual cuckoo call and then give a hoarse hurried call and break down " imagine the cuckoo already " say stepan arkadyevitch come out from behind a bush " yes I hear it " answer levin reluctantly break the stillness with his voice which sound disagreeable to himself " now it ’ come " stepan arkadyevitch ’s figure again go behind the bush and levin see nothing but the bright flash of a match follow by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette " tchk tchk " come the snap sound of stepan arkadyevitch cock his gun " what ’ that cry " ask oblonsky draw levin ’s attention to a prolonged cry as though a colt be whinny in a high voice in play " oh do n’t you know it that ’ the hare but enough talk listen it ’ fly " almost shriek levin cock his gun they hear a shrill whistle in the distance and in the exact time so well know to the sportsman two second later — another a third and after the third whistle the hoarse guttural cry could be hear levin look about he to right and to left and there just face he against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoot of the aspen he see the fly bird it be fly straight towards he the guttural cry like the even tearing of some strong stuff sound close to his ear the long beak and neck of the bird could be see and at the very instant when levin be take aim behind the bush where oblonsky stand there be a flash of red lightning the bird drop like an arrow and dart upwards again again come the red flash and the sound of a blow and flutter its wing as though try to keep up in the air the bird halt stop still an instant and fall with a heavy splash on the slushy ground " can I have miss it " shout stepan arkadyevitch who could not see for the smoke " here it be " say levin point to laska who with one ear raise wag the end of her shaggy tail come slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure and as it be smile bring the dead bird to her master " well I ’m glad you be successful " say levin who at the same time have a sense of envy that he have not succeed in shoot the snipe " it be a bad shot from the right barrel " respond stepan arkadyevitch load his gun " sh it ’ fly " the shrill whistle rapidly follow one another be hear again two snipe play and chase one another and only whistle not cry fly straight at the very head of the sportsman there be the report of four shot and like swallow the snipe turn swift somersault in the air and vanish from sight the standshooting be capital stepan arkadyevitch shoot two more bird and levin two of which one be not find it begin to get dark venus bright and silvery shine with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch tree and high up in the east twinkle the red light of arcturus over his head levin make out the star of the great bear and lose they again the snipe have cease fly but levin resolve to stay a little long till venus which he see below a branch of birch should be above it and the star of the great bear should be perfectly plain venus have rise above the branch and the ear of the great bear with its shaft be now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky yet still he wait " be not it time to go home " say stepan arkadyevitch it be quite still now in the copse and not a bird be stir " let ’s stay a little while " answer levin " as you like " they be stand now about fifteen pace from one another " stiva " say levin unexpectedly " how be it you do not tell I whether your sisterinlaw ’ marry yet or when she ’ go to be " levin feel so resolute and serene that no answer he fancy could affect he but he have never dream of what stepan arkadyevitch reply " she ’ never think of be marry and be not think of it but she ’ very ill and the doctor have send she abroad they ’re positively afraid she may not live " " what " cry levin " very ill what be wrong with she how have she " while they be say this laska with ear prick up be look upwards at the sky and reproachfully at they " they have choose a time to talk " she be think " it ’ on the wing here it be yes it be they ’ll miss it " think laska but at that very instant both suddenly hear a shrill whistle which as it be smite on their ear and both suddenly seize their gun and two flash gleam and two bang sound at the very same instant the snipe fly high above instantly fold its wing and fall into a thicket bend down the delicate shoot " splendid together " cry levin and he run with laska into the thicket to look for the snipe " oh yes what be it that be unpleasant " he wonder " yes kitty ’ ill well it can not be help I ’m very sorry " he think " she ’ find it be not she a clever thing " he say take the warm bird from laska ’s mouth and pack it into the almost full game bag " I ’ve get it stiva " he shout on the way home levin ask all detail of kitty ’s illness and the shtcherbatsky ' plan and though he would have be ashamed to admit it he be pleased at what he hear he be pleased that there be still hope and still more pleased that she should be suffer who have make he suffer so much but when stepan arkadyevitch begin to speak of the cause of kitty ’s illness and mention vronsky ’s name levin cut he short " I have no right whatever to know family matter and to tell the truth no interest in they either " stepan arkadyevitch smile hardly perceptibly catch the instantaneous change he know so well in levin ’s face which have become as gloomy as it have be bright a minute before " have you quite settle about the forest with ryabinin " ask levin " yes it ’ settle the price be magnificent thirtyeight thousand eight straight away and the rest in six year I ’ve be bother about it for ever so long no one would give more " " then you ’ve as good as give away your forest for nothing " say levin gloomily " how do you mean for nothing " say stepan arkadyevitch with a goodhumored smile know that nothing would be right in levin ’s eye now " because the forest be worth at least a hundred and fifty rouble the acre " answer levin " oh these farmer " say stepan arkadyevitch playfully " your tone of contempt for we poor townsfolk but when it come to business we do it well than anyone I assure you I have reckon it all out " he say " and the forest be fetch a very good price — so much so that I ’m afraid of this fellow ’s cry off in fact you know it ’ not ' timber ' " say stepan arkadyevitch hope by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubt " and it will not run to more than twentyfive yard of fagot per acre and he ’ give I at the rate of seventy rouble the acre " levin smile contemptuously " I know " he think " that fashion not only in he but in all city people who after be twice in ten year in the country pick up two or three phrase and use they in season and out of season firmly persuade that they know all about it ' timber run to so many yard the acre ' he say those word without understand they himself " " i would not attempt to teach you what you write about in your office " say he " and if need arise I should come to you to ask about it but you ’re so positive you know all the lore of the forest it ’ difficult have you count the tree " " how count the tree " say stepan arkadyevitch laugh still try to draw his friend out of his illtemper " count the sand of the sea number the star some high power might do it " " oh well the high power of ryabinin can not a single merchant ever buy a forest without count the tree unless they get it give they for nothing as you ’re do now I know your forest I go there every year shoot and your forest ’ worth a hundred and fifty rouble an acre pay down while he ’ give you sixty by installment so that in fact you ’re make he a present of thirty thousand " " come do not let your imagination run away with you " say stepan arkadyevitch piteously " why be it none would give it then " " why because he have an understanding with the merchant he ’ buy they off I ’ve have to do with all of they I know they they ’re not merchant you know they ’re speculator he would not look at a bargain that give he ten fifteen per cent profit but hold back to buy a rouble ’s worth for twenty kopeck " " well enough of it you ’re out of temper " " not the least " say levin gloomily as they drive up to the house at the step there stand a trap tightly cover with iron and leather with a sleek horse tightly harness with broad collarstrap in the trap sit the chubby tightly belted clerk who serve ryabinin as coachman ryabinin himself be already in the house and meet the friend in the hall ryabinin be a tall thinnish middleaged man with mustache and a projecting cleanshaven chin and prominent muddylooking eye he be dress in a longskirted blue coat with button below the waist at the back and wear high boot wrinkled over the ankle and straight over the calf with big galosh draw over they he rub his face with his handkerchief and wrap round he his coat which sit extremely well as it be he greet they with a smile hold out his hand to stepan arkadyevitch as though he want to catch something " so here you be " say stepan arkadyevitch give he his hand " that ’ capital " " I do not venture to disregard your excellency ’s command though the road be extremely bad I positively walk the whole way but I be here at my time konstantin dmitrievitch my respect " he turn to levin try to seize his hand too but levin scowl make as though he do not notice his hand and take out the snipe " your honor have be divert yourselves with the chase what kind of bird may it be pray " add ryabinin look contemptuously at the snipe " a great delicacy I suppose " and he shake his head disapprovingly as though he have grave doubt whether this game be worth the candle " would you like to go into my study " levin say in french to stepan arkadyevitch scowl morosely " go into my study you can talk there " " quite so where you please " say ryabinin with contemptuous dignity as though wish to make it feel that other might be in difficulty as to how to behave but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything on enter the study ryabinin look about as his habit be as though seek the holy picture but when he have find it he do not cross himself he scan the bookcase and bookshelf and with the same dubious air with which he have regard the snipe he smile contemptuously and shake his head disapprovingly as though by no means willing to allow that this game be worth the candle " well have you bring the money " ask oblonsky " sit down " " oh do not trouble about the money I ’ve come to see you to talk it over " " what be there to talk over but do sit down " " I do not mind if I do " say ryabinin sit down and lean his elbow on the back of his chair in a position of the intense discomfort to himself " you must knock it down a bit prince it would be too bad the money be ready conclusively to the last farthing as to pay the money down there ’ll be no hitch there " levin who have meanwhile be put his gun away in the cupboard be just go out of the door but catch the merchant ’s word he stop " why you ’ve get the forest for nothing as it be " he say " he come to I too late or I ’d have fix the price for he " ryabinin get up and in silence with a smile he look levin down and up " very close about money be konstantin dmitrievitch " he say with a smile turn to stepan arkadyevitch " there ’ positively no dealing with he I be bargain for some wheat of he and a pretty price I offer too " " why should I give you my good for nothing I do not pick it up on the ground nor steal it either " " mercy on we nowadays there ’ no chance at all of stealing with the open court and everything do in style nowadays there ’ no question of stealing we be just talk thing over like gentleman his excellency ’ ask too much for the forest I can not make both end meet over it I must ask for a little concession " " but be the thing settle between you or not if it ’ settle it ’ useless haggle but if it ’ not " say levin " I ’ll buy the forest " the smile vanish at once from ryabinin ’s face a hawklike greedy cruel expression be leave upon it with rapid bony finger he unbutton his coat reveal a shirt bronze waistcoat button and a watch chain and quickly pull out a fat old pocketbook " here you be the forest be mine " he say cross himself quickly and hold out his hand " take the money it ’ my forest that ’ ryabinin ’s way of do business he do not haggle over every halfpenny " he add scowl and wave the pocketbook " I would not be in a hurry if I be you " say levin " come really " say oblonsky in surprise " I ’ve give my word you know " levin go out of the room slam the door ryabinin look towards the door and shake his head with a smile " it ’ all youthfulness — positively nothing but boyishness why I ’m buy it upon my honor simply believe I for the glory of it that ryabinin and no one else should have buy the copse of oblonsky and as to the profit why I must make what god give in god ’s name if you would kindly sign the titledeed " within an hour the merchant stroke his big overcoat neatly down and hook up his jacket with the agreement in his pocket seat himself in his tightly cover trap and drive homeward " ugh these gentlefolk " he say to the clerk " they — they’re a nice lot " " that ’ so " respond the clerk hand he the rein and button the leather apron " but I can congratulate you on the purchase mihail ignatitch " " well well " stepan arkadyevitch go upstairs with his pocket bulge with note which the merchant have pay he for three month in advance the business of the forest be over the money in his pocket their shooting have be excellent and stepan arkadyevitch be in the happy frame of mind and so he feel specially anxious to dissipate the illhumor that have come upon levin he want to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it have be begin levin certainly be out of humor and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor he could not control his mood the intoxication of the news that kitty be not married have gradually begin to work upon he kitty be not married but ill and ill from love for a man who have slight she this slight as it be rebound upon he vronsky have slight she and she have slight he levin consequently vronsky have the right to despise levin and therefore he be his enemy but all this levin do not think out he vaguely feel that there be something in it insulting to he and he be not angry now at what have disturb he but he fall foul of everything that present itself the stupid sale of the forest the fraud practice upon oblonsky and conclude in his house exasperate he " well finish " he say meet stepan arkadyevitch upstairs " would you like supper " " well I would not say no to it what an appetite I get in the country wonderful why do not you offer ryabinin something " " oh damn he " " still how you do treat he " say oblonsky " you do not even shake hand with he why not shake hand with he " " because I do not shake hand with a waiter and a waiter ’ a hundred time well than he be " " what a reactionist you be really what about the amalgamation of class " say oblonsky " anyone who like amalgamating be welcome to it but it sicken I " " you ’re a regular reactionist I see " " really I have never consider what I be I be konstantin levin and nothing else " " and konstantin levin very much out of temper " say stepan arkadyevitch smile " yes I be out of temper and do you know why because — excuse I — of your stupid sale " stepan arkadyevitch frown goodhumoredly like one who feel himself tease and attack for no fault of his own " come enough about it " he say " when do anybody ever sell anything without be tell immediately after the sale ' it be worth much more ' but when one want to sell no one will give anything no I see you ’ve a grudge against that unlucky ryabinin " " maybe I have and do you know why you ’ll say again that I ’m a reactionist or some other terrible word but all the same it do annoy and anger I to see on all side the impoverishing of the nobility to which I belong and in spite of the amalgamation of class I ’m glad to belong and their impoverishment be not due to extravagance — that would be nothing live in good style — that ’ the proper thing for nobleman it ’ only the noble who know how to do it now the peasant about we buy land and I do not mind that the gentleman do nothing while the peasant work and supplant the idle man that ’ as it ought to be and I ’m very glad for the peasant but I do mind see the process of impoverishment from a sort of — I do not know what to call it — innocence here a polish speculator buy for half its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who live in nice and there a merchant will get three acre of land worth ten rouble as security for the loan of one rouble here for no kind of reason you ’ve make that rascal a present of thirty thousand rouble " " well what should I have do count every tree " " of course they must be count you do not count they but ryabinin do ryabinin ’s child will have mean of livelihood and education while yours maybe will not " " well you must excuse I but there ’ something mean in this counting we have our business and they have theirs and they must make their profit anyway the thing ’ do and there ’ an end of it and here come some poach egg my favorite dish and agafea mihalovna will give we that marvelous herbbrandy " stepan arkadyevitch sit down at the table and begin joke with agafea mihalovna assure she that it be long since he have taste such a dinner and such a supper " well you do praise it anyway " say agafea mihalovna " but konstantin dmitrievitch give he what you will — a crust of bread — he’ll eat it and walk away " though levin try to control himself he be gloomy and silent he want to put one question to stepan arkadyevitch but he could not bring himself to the point and could not find the word or the moment in which to put it stepan arkadyevitch have go down to his room undress again wash and attire in a nightshirt with goffered frill he have get into bed but levin still linger in his room talk of various trifling matter and not dare to ask what he want to know " how wonderfully they make this soap " he say gaze at a piece of soap he be handle which agafea mihalovna have put ready for the visitor but oblonsky have not use " only look why it ’ a work of art " " yes everything ’ bring to such a pitch of perfection nowadays " say stepan arkadyevitch with a moist and blissful yawn " the theater for instance and the entertainment   a — a — a " he yawn " the electric light everywhere   a — a — a " " yes the electric light " say levin " yes oh and where ’ vronsky now " he ask suddenly lay down the soap " vronsky " say stepan arkadyevitch check his yawn " he ’ in petersburg he leave soon after you do and he ’ not once be in moscow since and do you know kostya I ’ll tell you the truth " he go on lean his elbow on the table and prop on his hand his handsome ruddy face in which his moist goodnatured sleepy eye shine like star " it ’ your own fault you take fright at the sight of your rival but as I tell you at the time I could not say which have the well chance why do not you fight it out I tell you at the time that " he yawn inwardly without open his mouth " do he know or do not he that I do make an offer " levin wonder gaze at he " yes there ’ something humbugging diplomatic in his face " and feel he be blush he look stepan arkadyevitch straight in the face without speak " if there be anything on her side at the time it be nothing but a superficial attraction " pursue oblonsky " his be such a perfect aristocrat do not you know and his future position in society have an influence not with she but with her mother " levin scowl the humiliation of his rejection sting he to the heart as though it be a fresh wound he have only just receive but he be at home and the wall of home be a support " stay stay " he begin interrupt oblonsky " you talk of his be an aristocrat but allow I to ask what it consist in that aristocracy of vronsky or of anybody else beside which I can be look down upon you consider vronsky an aristocrat but I do not a man whose father crawl up from nothing at all by intrigue and whose mother — god know whom she be not mix up with no excuse I but I consider myself aristocratic and people like I who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generation of their family of the high degree of breeding talent and intellect of course that ’ another matter and have never curry favor with anyone never depend on anyone for anything like my father and my grandfather and I know many such you think it mean of I to count the tree in my forest while you make ryabinin a present of thirty thousand but you get rent from your land and I do not know what while I do n’t and so I prize what ’ come to I from my ancestor or be win by hard work we be aristocrat and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful of this world and who can be buy for twopence halfpenny " " well but whom be you attack I agree with you " say stepan arkadyevitch sincerely and genially though he be aware that in the class of those who could be buy for twopence halfpenny levin be reckon he too levin ’s warmth give he genuine pleasure " whom be you attack though a good deal be not true that you say about vronsky but I will not talk about that I tell you straight out if I be you I should go back with I to moscow and " " no I do not know whether you know it or not but I do not care and I tell you — I do make an offer and be reject and katerina alexandrovna be nothing now to I but a painful and humiliating reminiscence " " what ever for what nonsense " " but we will not talk about it please forgive I if I ’ve be nasty " say levin now that he have open his heart he become as he have be in the morning " you ’re not angry with I stiva please do not be angry " he say and smile he take his hand " of course not not a bit and no reason to be I ’m glad we ’ve speak openly and do you know standshooting in the morning be unusually good — why not go I could not sleep the night anyway but I might go straight from shooting to the station " " capital " although all vronsky ’s inner life be absorb in his passion his external life unalterably and inevitably

close to the race course and there his mare be to have be take the previous day he have not yet see she there during the last few day he have not ride she out for exercise himself but have put she in the charge of the trainer and so now he positively do not know in what condition his mare have arrive yesterday and be today he have scarcely get out of his carriage when his groom the socalle " stable boy " recognize the carriage some way off call the trainer a drylooking englishman in high boot and a short jacket cleanshaven except for a tuft below his chin come to meet he walk with the uncouth gait of jockey turn his elbow out and sway from side to side " well how ’ froufrou " vronsky ask in english " all right sir " the englishman ’s voice respond somewhere in the inside of his throat " well not go in " he add touch his hat " I ’ve put a muzzle on she and the mare ’ fidgety well not go in it ’ll excite the mare " " no I ’m go in I want to look at she " " come along then " say the englishman frown and speak with his mouth shut and with swinge elbow he go on in front with his disjointed gait they go into the little yard in front of the shed a stable boy spruce and smart in his holiday attire meet they with a broom in his hand and follow they in the shed there be five horse in their separate stall and vronsky know that his chief rival gladiator a very tall chestnut horse have be bring there and must be stand among they even more than his mare vronsky long to see gladiator whom he have never see but he know that by the etiquette of the race course it be not merely impossible for he to see the horse but improper even to ask question about he just as he be pass along the passage the boy open the door into the second horsebox on the left and vronsky catch a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white leg he know that this be gladiator but with the feeling of a man turn away from the sight of another man ’s open letter he turn round and go into froufrou ’s stall " the horse be here belong to mak mak I never can say the name " say the englishman over his shoulder point his big finger and dirty nail towards gladiator ’s stall " mahotin yes he ’ my most serious rival " say vronsky " if you be ride he " say the englishman " I ’d bet on you " " froufrou ’ more nervous he ’ strong " say vronsky smile at the compliment to his riding " in a steeplechase it all depend on riding and on pluck " say the englishman of pluck — that is energy and courage — vronsky do not merely feel that he have enough what be of far more importance he be firmly convince that no one in the world could have more of this " pluck " than he have " do not you think I want more thinning down " " oh no " answer the englishman " please do not speak loud the mare ’ fidgety " he add nod towards the horsebox before which they be stand and from which come the sound of restless stamping in the straw he open the door and vronsky go into the horsebox dimly light by one little window in the horsebox stand a dark bay mare with a muzzle on pick at the fresh straw with her hoof look round he in the twilight of the horsebox vronsky unconsciously take in once more in a comprehensive glance all the point of his favorite mare froufrou be a beast of medium size not altogether free from reproach from a breeder ’s point of view she be smallboned all over though her chest be extremely prominent in front it be narrow her hindquarter be a little droop and in her foreleg and still more in her hindleg there be a noticeable curvature the muscle of both hind and foreleg be not very thick but across her shoulder the mare be exceptionally broad a peculiarity specially striking now that she be lean from training the bone of her leg below the knee look no thick than a finger from in front but be extraordinarily thick see from the side she look altogether except across the shoulder as it be pinch in at the side and press out in depth but she have in the high degree the quality that make all defect forget that quality be blood the blood that tell as the english expression have it the muscle stand up sharply under the network of sinew cover with the delicate mobile skin soft as satin and they be hard as bone her cleancut head with prominent bright spirited eye broaden out at the open nostril that show the red blood in the cartilage within about all her figure and especially her head there be a certain expression of energy and at the same time of softness she be one of those creature which seem only not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth do not allow they to to vronsky at any rate it seem that she understand all he feel at that moment look at she directly vronsky go towards she she draw in a deep breath and turn back her prominent eye till the white look bloodshot she start at the approach figure from the opposite side shake her muzzle and shift lightly from one leg to the other " there you see how fidgety she be " say the englishman " there darling there " say vronsky go up to the mare and speak soothingly to she but the near he come the more excited she grow only when he stand by her head she be suddenly quiet while the muscle quiver under her soft delicate coat vronsky pat her strong neck straighten over her sharp wither a stray lock of her mane that have fall on the other side and move his face near her dilated nostril transparent as a bat ’s wing she draw a loud breath and snort out through her tense nostril start prick up her sharp ear and put out her strong black lip towards vronsky as though she would nip hold of his sleeve but remember the muzzle she shake it and again begin restlessly stamp one after the other her shapely leg " quiet darling quiet " he say pat she again over her hindquarter and with a glad sense that his mare be in the well possible condition he go out of the horsebox the mare ’s excitement have infect vronsky he feel that his heart be throb and that he too like the mare long to move to bite it be both dreadful and delicious " well I rely on you then " he say to the englishman " halfpast six on the ground " " all right " say the englishman " oh where be you go my lord " he ask suddenly use the title " my lord " which he have scarcely ever use before vronsky in amazement raise his head and stare as he know how to stare not into the englishman ’s eye but at his forehead astound at the impertinence of his question but realize that in ask this the englishman have be look at he not as an employer but as a jockey he answer " I ’ve get to go to bryansky ’s I shall be home within an hour " " how often I ’m ask that question today " he say to himself and he blush a thing which rarely happen to he the englishman look gravely at he and as though he too know where vronsky be go he add " the great thing ’ to keep quiet before a race " say he " do not get out of temper or upset about anything " " all right " answer vronsky smile and jump into his carriage he tell the man to drive to peterhof before he have drive many pace away the dark cloud that have be threaten rain all day break and there be a heavy downpour of rain " what a pity " think vronsky put up the roof of the carriage " it be muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp " as he sit in solitude in the closed carriage he take out his mother ’s letter and his brother ’s note and read they through yes it be the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone think fit to interfere in the affair of his heart this interference arouse in he a feeling of angry hatred — a feeling he have rarely know before " what business be it of theirs why do everybody feel call upon to concern himself about I and why do they worry I so just because they see that this be something they can not understand if it be a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have leave I alone they feel that this be something different that this be not a mere pastime that this woman be dear to I than life and this be incomprehensible and that ’ why it annoy they whatever our destiny be or may be we have make it ourselves and we do not complain of it " he say in the word we link himself with anna " no they must needs teach we how to live they have not an idea of what happiness be they do not know that without our love for we there be neither happiness nor unhappiness — no life at all " he think he be angry with all of they for their interference just because he feel in his soul that you all these people be right he feel that the love that bind he to anna be not a momentary impulse which would pass as worldly intrigue do pass leave no other trace in the life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memory he feel all the torture of his own and her position all the difficulty there be for they conspicuous as they be in the eye of all the world in conceal their love in lying and deceive and in lie deceive feign and continually think of other when the passion that unite they be so intense that they be both oblivious of everything else but their love he vividly recall all the constantly recur instance of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit which be so against his natural bent he recall particularly vividly the shame he have more than once detect in she at this necessity for lying and deceit and he experience the strange feeling that have sometimes come upon he since his secret love for anna this be a feeling of loathing for something — whether for alexey alexandrovitch or for himself or for the whole world he could not have say but he always drive away this strange feeling now too he shake it off and continue the thread of his thought " yes she be unhappy before but proud and at peace and now she can not be at peace and feel secure in her dignity though she do not show it yes we must put an end to it " he decide and for the first time the idea clearly present itself that it be essential to put an end to this false position and the soon the well " throw up everything she and I and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love " he say to himself the rain do not last long and by the time vronsky arrive his shafthorse trot at full speed and drag the tracehorse gallop through the mud with their rein hang loose the sun have peep out again the roof of the summer villa and the old limetree in the garden on both side of the principal street sparkle with wet brilliance and from the twig come a pleasant drip and from the roof rush stream of water he think no more of the shower spoil the race course but be rejoice now that — thank to the rain — he would be sure to find she at home and alone as he know that alexey alexandrovitch who have lately return from a foreign watering place have not move from petersburg hope to find she alone vronsky alighted as he always do to avoid attract attention before cross the bridge and walk to the house he do not go up the step to the street door but go into the court " have your master come " he ask a gardener " no sir the mistress be at home but will you please go to the front door there be servant there " the gardener answer " they ’ll open the door " " no I ’ll go in from the garden " and feel satisfied that she be alone and want to take she by surprise since he have not promise to be there today and she would certainly not expect he to come before the race he walk hold his sword and step cautiously over the sandy path border with flower to the terrace that look out upon the garden vronsky forget now all that he have think on the way of the hardship and difficulty of their position he think of nothing but that he would see she directly not in imagination but live all of she as she be in reality he be just go in step on his whole foot so as not to creak up the worn step of the terrace when he suddenly remember what he always forget and what cause the most torturing side of his relation with she her son with his questioning — hostile as he fancy — eye this boy be more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom when he be present both vronsky and anna do not merely avoid speak of anything that they could not have repeat before everyone they do not even allow themselves to refer by hint to anything the boy do not understand they have make no agreement about this it have settle itself they would have feel it wound themselves to deceive the child in his presence they talk like acquaintance but in spite of this caution vronsky often see the child ’s intent bewildered glance fix upon he and a strange shyness uncertainty at one time friendliness at another coldness and reserve in the boy ’s manner to he as though the child feel that between this man and his mother there exist some important bond the significance of which he could not understand as a fact the boy do feel that he could not understand this relation and he try painfully and be not able to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man with a child ’s keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling he see distinctly that his father his governess his nurse — all do not merely dislike vronsky but look on he with horror and aversion though they never say anything about he while his mother look on he as her great friend " what do it mean who be he how ought I to love he if I do not know it ’ my fault either I ’m stupid or a naughty boy " think the child and this be what cause his dubious inquire sometimes hostile expression and the shyness and uncertainty which vronsky find so irksome this child ’s presence always and infallibly call up in vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he have experience of late this child ’s presence call up both in vronsky and in anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who see by the compass that the direction in which he be swiftly move be far from the right one but that to arrest his motion be not in his power that every instant be carry he far and far away and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction be the same as admit his certain ruin this child with his innocent outlook upon life be the compass that show they the point to which they have depart from what they know but do not want to know this time seryozha be not at home and she be completely alone she be sit on the terrace wait for the return of her son who have go out for his walk and be catch in the rain she have send a manservant and a maid out to look for he dress in a white gown deeply embroider she be sit in a corner of the terrace behind some flower and do not hear he bend her curly black head she press her forehead against a cool watering pot that stand on the parapet and both her lovely hand with the ring he know so well clasp the pot the beauty of her whole figure her head her neck her hand strike vronsky every time as something new and unexpected he stand still gaze at she in ecstasy but directly he would have make a step to come near to she she be aware of his presence push away the watering pot and turn her flushed face towards he " what ’ the matter you be ill " he say to she in french go up to she he would have run to she but remember that there might be spectator he look round towards the balcony door and redden a little as he always redden feeling that he have to be afraid and be on his guard " no I ’m quite well " she say get up and press his outstretched hand tightly " I do not expect   thee " " mercy what cold hand " he say " you startle I " she say " I ’m alone and expect seryozha he ’ out for a walk they ’ll come in from this side " but in spite of her effort to be calm her lip be quiver " forgive I for come but I could not pass the day without see you " he go on speak french as he always do to avoid use the stiff russian plural form so impossibly frigid between they and the dangerously intimate singular " forgive you I ’m so glad " " but you ’re ill or worried " he go on not let go her hand and bend over she " what be you think of " " always the same thing " she say with a smile she speak the truth if ever at any moment she have be ask what she be think of she could have answer truly of the same thing of her happiness and her unhappiness she be think just when he come upon she of this why be it she wonder that to other to betsy she know of her secret connection with tushkevitch it be all easy while to she it be such torture today this thought gain special poignancy from certain other consideration she ask he about the race he answer her question and see that she be agitated try to calm she he begin tell she in the simple tone the detail of his preparation for the race " tell he or not tell he " she think look into his quiet affectionate eye " he be so happy so absorbed in his race that he will not understand as he ought he will not understand all the gravity of this fact to we " " but you have not tell I what you be think of when I come in " he say interrupt his narrative " please tell I " she do not answer and bend her head a little she look inquiringly at he from under her brow her eye shine under their long lash her hand shake as it play with a leaf she have pick he see it and his face express that utter subjection that slavish devotion which have do so much to win she " I see something have happen do you suppose I can be at peace know you have a trouble I be not share tell I for god ’s sake " he repeat imploringly " yes I shall not be able to forgive he if he do not realize all the gravity of it well not tell why put he to the proof " she think still stare at he in the same way and feel the hand that hold the leaf be tremble more and more " for god ’s sake " he repeat take her hand " shall I tell you " " yes yes yes " " I ’m with child " she say softly and deliberately the leaf in her hand shake more violently but she do not take her eye off he watch how he would take it he turn white would have say something but stop he drop her hand and his head sink on his breast " yes he realize all the gravity of it " she think and gratefully she press his hand but she be mistaken in think he realize the gravity of the fact as she a woman realize it on hear it he feel come upon he with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone but at the same time he feel that the turningpoint he have be long for have come now that it be impossible to go on conceal thing from her husband and it be inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position but besides that her emotion physically affect he in the same way he look at she with a look of submissive tenderness kiss her hand get up and in silence pace up and down the terrace " yes " he say go up to she resolutely " neither you nor I have look on our relation as a pass amusement and now our fate be seal it be absolutely necessary to put an end”—he look round as he spoke—“to the deception in which we be live " " put an end how put an end alexey " she say softly she be calm now and her face light up with a tender smile " leave your husband and make our life one " " it be one as it be " she answer scarcely audibly " yes but altogether altogether " " but how alexey tell I how " she say in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own position " be there any way out of such a position be I not the wife of my husband " " there be a way out of every position we must take our line " he say " anything ’ well than the position in which you ’re live of course I see how you torture yourself over everything — the world and your son and your husband " " oh not over my husband " she say with a quiet smile " I do not know he I do not think of he he do not exist " " you ’re not speak sincerely I know you you worry about he too " " oh he do not even know " she say and suddenly a hot flush come over her face her cheek her brow her neck crimson and tear of shame come into her eye " but we will not talk of he " vronsky have several time already though not so resolutely as now try to bring she to consider their position and every time he have be confront by the same superficiality and triviality with which she meet his appeal now it be as though there be something in this which she could not or would not face as though directly she begin to speak of this she the real anna retreat somehow into herself and another strange and unaccountable woman come out whom he do not love and whom he fear and who be in opposition to he but today he be resolved to have it out " whether he know or not " say vronsky in his usual quiet and resolute tone " that ’ nothing to do with we we can not   you can not stay like this especially now " " what ’ to be do accord to you " she ask with the same frivolous irony she who have so fear he would take her condition too lightly be now vex with he for deduce from it the necessity of take some step " tell he everything and leave he " " very well let we suppose I do that " she say " do you know what the result of that would be I can tell you it all beforehand " and a wicked light gleam in her eye that have be so soft a minute before " ' eh you love another man and have enter into criminal intrigue

tight riding breech ride off at a gallop crouch up like a cat on the saddle in imitation of english jockey prince kuzovlev sit with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the grabovsky stud while an english groom lead she by the bridle vronsky and all his comrade know kuzovlev and his peculiarity of " weak nerve " and terrible vanity they know that he be afraid of everything afraid of ride a spirited horse but now just because it be terrible because people break their neck and there be a doctor stand at each obstacle and an ambulance with a cross on it and a sister of mercy he have make

high just before the pavilion a dry ditch a ditch full of water a precipitous slope an irish barricade one of the most difficult obstacle consist of a mound fence with brushwood beyond which be a ditch out of sight for the horse so that the horse have to clear both obstacle or might be kill then two more ditch fill with water and one dry one and the end of the race be just face the pavilion but the race begin not in the ring but two hundred yard away from it and in that part of the course be the first obstacle a dammedup stream seven foot in breadth which the racer could leap or wade through as they prefer three time they be range ready to start but each time some horse thrust itself out of line and they have to begin again the umpire who be start they colonel sestrin be begin to lose his temper when at last for the fourth time he shout " away " and the racer start every eye every operaglass be turn on the brightly colored group of rider at the moment they be in line to start " they ’re off they ’re start " be hear on all side after the hush of expectation and little group and solitary figure among the public begin run from place to place to get a well view in the very first minute the close group of horseman draw out and it could be see that they be approach the stream in two and three and one behind another to the spectator it seem as though they have all start simultaneously but to the racer there be second of difference that have great value to they froufrou excited and overnervous have lose the first moment and several horse have start before she but before reach the stream vronsky who be hold in the mare with all his force as she tug at the bridle easily overtake three and there be leave in front of he mahotin ’s chestnut gladiator whose hindquarter be move lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of vronsky and in front of all the dainty mare diana bear kuzovlev more dead than alive for the first instant vronsky be not master either of himself or his mare up to the first obstacle the stream he could not guide the motion of his mare gladiator and diana come up to it together and almost at the same instant simultaneously they rise above the stream and fly across to the other side froufrou dart after they as if fly but at the very moment when vronsky feel himself in the air he suddenly see almost under his mare ’s hoof kuzovlev who be flounder with diana on the further side of the stream kuzovlev have let go the rein as he take the leap and the mare have send he fly over her head those detail vronsky learn later at the moment all he see be that just under he where froufrou must alight diana ’s leg or head might be in the way but froufrou draw up her leg and back in the very act of leap like a fall cat and clear the other mare alight beyond she " o the darling " think vronsky after cross the stream vronsky have complete control of his mare and begin hold she in intend to cross the great barrier behind mahotin and to try to overtake he in the clear ground of about five hundred yard that follow it the great barrier stand just in front of the imperial pavilion the tsar and the whole court and crowd of people be all gaze at they — at he and mahotin a length ahead of he as they draw near the " devil " as the solid barrier be call vronsky be aware of those eye fasten upon he from all side but he see nothing except the ear and neck of his own mare the ground race to meet he and the back and white leg of gladiator beat time swiftly before he and keep always the same distance ahead gladiator rise with no sound of knock against anything with a wave of his short tail he disappear from vronsky ’s sight " bravo " cry a voice at the same instant under vronsky ’s eye right before he flash the paling of the barrier without the slight change in her action his mare fly over it the paling vanish and he hear only a crash behind he the mare excite by gladiator ’s keeping ahead have rise too soon before the barrier and graze it with her hind hoof but her pace never change and vronsky feel a spatter of mud in his face realize that he be once more the same distance from gladiator once more he perceive in front of he the same back and short tail and again the same swiftly move white leg that get no far away at the very moment when vronsky think that now be the time to overtake mahotin froufrou herself understand his thought without any incitement on his part gain ground considerably and begin get alongside of mahotin on the most favorable side close to the inner cord mahotin would not let she pass that side vronsky have hardly form the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side when froufrou shift her pace and begin overtake he on the other side froufrou ’s shoulder begin by now to be dark with sweat be even with gladiator ’s back for a few length they move evenly but before the obstacle they be approach vronsky begin work at the rein anxious to avoid have to take the outer circle and swiftly pass mahotin just upon the declivity he catch a glimpse of his mudstained face as he flash by he even fancy that he smile vronsky pass mahotin but he be immediately aware of he close upon he and he never cease hear the eventhudding hoof and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of gladiator the next two obstacle the water course and the barrier be easily cross but vronsky begin to hear the snorting and thud of gladiator close upon he he urge on his mare and to his delight feel that she easily quicken her pace and the thud of gladiator ’s hoof be again hear at the same distance away vronsky be at the head of the race just as he want to be and as cord have advise and now he feel sure of be the winner his excitement his delight and his tenderness for froufrou grow keen and keen he long to look round again but he do not dare do this and try to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in she as he feel that gladiator still keep there remain only one obstacle the most difficult if he could cross it ahead of the other he would come in first he be fly towards the irish barricade froufrou and he both together see the barricade in the distance and both the man and the mare have a moment ’s hesitation he see the uncertainty in the mare ’s ear and lift the whip but at the same time feel that his fear be groundless the mare know what be want she quicken her pace and rise smoothly just as he have fancy she would and as she leave the ground give herself up to the force of her rush which carry she far beyond the ditch and with the same rhythm without effort with the same leg forward froufrou fall back into her pace again " bravo vronsky " he hear shout from a knot of man — he know they be his friend in the regiment — who be stand at the obstacle he could not fail to recognize yashvin ’s voice though he do not see he " o my sweet " he say inwardly to froufrou as he listen for what be happen behind " he ’ clear it " he think catch the thud of gladiator ’s hoof behind he there remain only the last ditch fill with water and five foot wide vronsky do not even look at it but anxious to get in a long way first begin saw away at the rein lift the mare ’s head and let it go in time with her pace he feel that the mare be at her very last reserve of strength not her neck and shoulder merely be wet but the sweat be stand in drop on her mane her head her sharp ear and her breath come in short sharp gasp but he know that she have strength leave more than enough for the remain five hundred yard it be only from feel himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that vronsky know how greatly the mare have quicken her pace she fly over the ditch as though not notice it she fly over it like a bird but at the same instant vronsky to his horror feel that he have fail to keep up with the mare ’s pace that he have he do not know how make a fearful unpardonable mistake in recover his seat in the saddle all at once his position have shift and he know that something awful have happen he could not yet make out what have happen when the white leg of a chestnut horse flash by close to he and mahotin pass at a swift gallop vronsky be touch the ground with one foot and his mare be sink on that foot he just have time to free his leg when she fall on one side gasp painfully and make vain effort to rise with her delicate soak neck she flutter on the ground at his foot like a shot bird the clumsy movement make by vronsky have break her back but that he only know much later at that moment he know only that mahotin have fly swiftly by while he stand stagger alone on the muddy motionless ground and froufrou lie gasp before he bend her head back and gaze at he with her exquisite eye still unable to realize what have happen vronsky tug at his mare ’s rein again she struggle all over like a fish and her shoulder set the saddle heave she rise on her front leg but unable to lift her back she quiver all over and again fall on her side with a face hideous with passion his lower jaw tremble and his cheek white vronsky kick she with his heel in the stomach and again fall to tug at the rein she do not stir but thrust her nose into the ground she simply gaze at her master with her speak eye " a — a — a " groan vronsky clutch at his head " ah what have I do " he cry " the race lose and my fault shameful unpardonable and the poor darling ruin mare ah what have I do " a crowd of man a doctor and his assistant the officer of his regiment run up to he to his misery he feel that he be whole and unhurt the mare have break she back and it be decide to shoot she vronsky could not answer question could not speak to anyone he turn and without pick up his cap that have fall off walk away from the race course not know where he be go he feel utterly wretched for the first time in his life he know the bitter sort of misfortune misfortune beyond remedy and cause by his own fault yashvin overtake he with his cap and lead he home and half an hour later vronsky have regain his selfpossession but the memory of that race remain for long in his heart the cruel and bitter memory of his life the external relation of alexey alexandrovitch and his wife have remain unchanged the sole difference lie in the fact that he be more busily occupied than ever as in former year at the beginning of the spring he have go to a foreign wateringplace for the sake of his health derange by the winter ’s work that every year grow heavy and just as always he return in july and at once fall to work as usual with increase energy as usual too his wife have move for the summer to a villa out of town while he remain in petersburg from the date of their conversation after the party at princess tverskaya ’s he have never speak again to anna of his suspicion and his jealousy and that habitual tone of his banter mimicry be the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife he be a little cold to his wife he simply seem to be slightly displeased with she for that first midnight conversation which she have repel in his attitude to she there be a shade of vexation but nothing more " you would not be open with I " he seem to say mentally address she " so much the bad for you now you may beg as you please but I will not be open with you so much the bad for you " he say mentally like a man who after vainly attempt to extinguish a fire should fly in a rage with his vain effort and say " oh very well then you shall burn for this " this man so subtle and astute in official life do not realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife he do not realize it because it be too terrible to he to realize his actual position and he shut down and lock and seal up in his heart that secret place where lie hide his feeling towards his family that be his wife and son he who have be such a careful father have from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son and adopt to he just the same bantering tone he use with his wife " aha young man " be the greeting with which he meet he alexey alexandrovitch assert and believe that he have never in any previous year have so much official business as that year but he be not aware that he seek work for himself that year that this be one of the mean for keep shut that secret place where lay hide his feeling towards his wife and son and his thought about they which become more terrible the long they lie there if anyone have have the right to ask alexey alexandrovitch what he think of his wife ’s behavior the mild and peaceable alexey alexandrovitch would have make no answer but he would have be greatly anger with any man who should question he on that subject for this reason there positively come into alexey alexandrovitch ’s face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquire after his wife ’s health alexey alexandrovitch do not want to think at all about his wife ’s behavior and he actually succeed in not think about it at all alexey alexandrovitch ’s permanent summer villa be in peterhof and the countess lidia ivanovna use as a rule to spend the summer there close to anna and constantly see she that year countess lidia ivanovna decline to settle in peterhof be not once at anna arkadyevna ’s and in conversation with alexey alexandrovitch hint at the unsuitability of anna ’s close intimacy with betsy and vronsky alexey alexandrovitch sternly cut she short roundly declare his wife to be above suspicion and from that time begin to avoid countess lidia ivanovna he do not want to see and do not see that many people in society cast dubious glance on his wife he do not want to understand and do not understand why his wife have so particularly insist on stay at tsarskoe where betsy be stay and not far from the camp of vronsky ’s regiment he do not allow himself to think about it and he do not think about it but all the same though he never admit it to himself and have no proof not even suspicious evidence in the bottom of his heart he know you all doubt that he be a deceive husband and he be profoundly miserable about it how often during those eight year of happy life with his wife alexey alexandrovitch have look at other man ’s faithless wife and other deceive husband and ask himself " how can people descend to that how be it they do not put an end to such a hideous position " but now when the misfortune have come upon himself he be so far from think of put an end to the position that he would not recognize it at all would not recognize it just because it be too awful too unnatural since his return from abroad alexey alexandrovitch have twice be at their country villa once he dine there another time he spend the evening there with a party of friend but he have not once stay the night there as it have be his habit to do in previous year the day of the race have be a very busy day for alexey alexandrovitch but when mentally sketch out the day in the morning he make up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife immediately after dinner and from there to the race which all the court be to witness and at which he be bind to be present he be go to see his wife because he have determine to see she once a week to keep up appearance and besides on that day

china who be stay in petersburg and with it she enclose a note beg he to see the traveler himself as he be an extremely interesting person from various point of view and likely to be useful alexey

which be not altogether satisfactory as it have happen that during that year owe to increase expense more have be pay out than usual and there be a deficit but the doctor a celebrated petersburg doctor who be an intimate acquaintance of alexey alexandrovitch take up a great deal of time alexey alexandrovitch have not expect he that day and be surprised at his visit and still more so when the doctor question he very carefully about his health listen to his breathing and tap at his liver alexey alexandrovitch do not know that his friend lidia ivanovna notice that he be not as well as usual that year have beg the doctor to go and examine he " do this for my sake " the countess lidia ivanovna have say to he " I will do it for the sake of russia countess " reply the doctor " a priceless

he be come away the doctor chance to meet on the staircase an acquaintance of his sludin who be secretary of alexey alexandrovitch ’s department they have be comrade at the university and though they rarely meet they think highly of each other and be excellent friend and so there be no one to whom the doctor would have give his opinion of a patient so freely as to sludin " how glad I be you ’ve be see he " say sludin " he ’ not well and I fancy well what do you think of he " " I ’ll tell you " say the doctor beckon over sludin ’s head to his coachman to bring the carriage round " it ’ just this " say the doctor take a finger of his kid glove in his white hand and pull it " if you do not strain the string and then try to break they you ’ll find it a difficult job but strain a string to its very utmost and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it and with his close assiduity his conscientious devotion to his work he ’ strain to the utmost and there ’ some outside burden weigh on he and not a light one " conclude the doctor raise his eyebrow significantly " will you be at the race " he add as he sink into his seat in the carriage " yes yes to be sure it do waste a lot of time " the doctor respond vaguely to some reply of sludin ’s he have not catch directly after the doctor who have take up so much time come the celebrated traveler and alexey

the high society have gather she catch sight of her husband in the distance two man her husband and her lover be the two center of her existence and unaide by her external sense she be aware of their nearness she be aware of her husband approach a long way off and she could not help follow he in the surge crowd in the midst of which he be move she watch his progress towards the pavilion see he now respond condescendingly to an ingratiating bow now exchange friendly nonchalant greeting with his equal now assiduously try to catch the eye of some great one of this world and take off his big round hat that squeeze the tip of his ear all these way of his she know and all be hateful to she " nothing but ambition nothing but the desire to get on that ’ all there be in his soul " she think " as for these lofty ideal love of culture religion they be only so many tool for get on " from his glance towards the lady ' pavilion he be stare straight at she but do not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin ribbon feather parasol and flower she see that he be look for she but she purposely avoid notice he " alexey alexandrovitch " princess betsy call to he " I ’m sure you do not see your wife here she be " he smile his chilly smile " there ’ so much splendor here that one ’s eye be dazzle " he say and he go into the pavilion he smile to his wife as a man should smile on meet his wife after only just part from she and greet the princess and other acquaintance give to each what be due — that be to say jest with the lady and deal out friendly greeting among the man below near the pavilion be stand an adjutantgeneral of whom alexey alexandrovitch have a high opinion note for his intelligence and culture alexey alexandrovitch enter into conversation with he there be an interval between the race and so nothing hinder conversation the adjutantgeneral express his disapproval of race alexey alexandrovitch reply defend they anna hear his high measured tone not lose one word and every word strike she as false and stab her ear with pain when the threemile steeplechase be begin she bend forward and gaze with fixed eye at vronsky as he go up to his horse and mount and at the same time she hear that loathsome neverceasing voice of her husband she be in an agony of terror for vronsky but a still great agony be the neverceasing as it seem to her stream of her husband ’s shrill voice with its familiar intonation " I ’m a wicked woman a lost woman " she think " but I do not like lying I can not endure falsehood while as for he her husband it ’ the breath of his life — falsehood he know all about it he see it all what do he care if he can talk so calmly if he be to kill I if he be to kill vronsky I might respect he no all he want be falsehood and propriety " anna say to herself not consider exactly what it be she want of her husband and how she would have like to see he behave she do not understand either that alexey alexandrovitch ’s peculiar loquacity that day so exasperating to she be merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness as a child that have be hurt skip about put all his muscle into movement to drown the pain in the same way alexey alexandrovitch need mental exercise to drown the thought of his wife that in her presence and in vronsky ’s and with the continual iteration of his name would force themselves on his attention and it be as natural for he to talk well and cleverly as it be natural for a child to skip about he be say " danger in the race of officer of cavalry man be an essential element in the race if england can point to the most brilliant feat of cavalry in military history it be simply owe to the fact that she have historically develop this force both in beast and in man sport have in my opinion a great value and as be always the case we see nothing but what be most superficial " " it ’ not superficial " say princess tverskaya " one of the officer they say have break two rib " alexey alexandrovitch smile his smile which uncover his tooth but reveal nothing more " we ’ll admit princess that that ’ not superficial " he say " but internal but that ’ not the point " and he turn again to the general with whom he be talk seriously " we must not forget that those who be take part in the race be military man who have choose that career and one must allow that every calling have its disagreeable side it form an integral part of the duty of an officer low sport such as prizefighting or spanish bullfight be a sign of barbarity but specialized trial of skill be a sign of development " " no I sha not come another time it ’ too upsetting " say princess betsy " be not it anna " " it be upsetting but one can not tear oneself away " say another lady " if I ’d be a roman woman I should never have miss a single circus " anna say nothing and keep her operaglass up gaze always at the same spot at that moment a tall general walk through the pavilion break off what he be say alexey alexandrovitch get up hurriedly though with dignity and bow low to the general " you ’re not race " the officer ask chaff he " my race be a hard one " alexey alexandrovitch respond deferentially and though the answer mean nothing the general look as though he have hear a witty remark from a witty man and fully relish la pointe de la sauce " there be two aspect " alexey alexandrovitch resume " those who take part and those who look on and love for such spectacle be an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator I admit but " " princess bet " sound stepan arkadyevitch ’s voice from below address betsy " who ’ your favorite " " anna and I be for kuzovlev " reply betsy " I ’m for vronsky a pair of glove " " do " " but it be a pretty sight be not it " alexey alexandrovitch pause while there be talk about he but he begin again directly " I admit that manly sport do not " he be continue but at that moment the racer start and all conversation cease alexey alexandrovitch too be silent and everyone stand up and turn towards the stream alexey alexandrovitch take no interest in the race and so he do not watch the racer but fall listlessly to scan the spectator with his weary eye his eye rest upon anna her face be white and set she be obviously see nothing and no one but one man her hand have convulsively clutch her fan and she hold her breath he look at she and hastily turn away scrutinize other face " but here ’ this lady too and other very much move as well it ’ very natural " alexey alexandrovitch tell himself he try not to look at she but unconsciously his eye be draw to she he examine that face again try not to read what be so plainly write on it and against his own will with horror read on it what he do not want to know the first fall — kuzovlev ’s at the stream — agitate everyone but alexey alexandrovitch see distinctly on anna ’s pale triumphant face that the man she be watch have not fall when after mahotin and vronsky have clear the bad barrier the next officer have be throw straight on his head at it and fatally injure and a shudder of horror pass over the whole public alexey alexandrovitch see that anna do not even notice it and have some difficulty in realize what they be talk of about she but more and more often and with great persistence he watch she anna wholly engross as she be with the race become aware of her husband ’s cold eye fix upon she from one side she glance round for an instant look inquiringly at he and with a slight frown turn away again " ah I do not care " she seem to say to he and she do not once glance at he again the race be an unlucky one and of the seventeen officer who ride in it more than half be throw and hurt towards the end of the race everyone be in a state of agitation which be intensify by the fact that the tsar be displeased everyone be loudly express disapprobation everyone be repeat a phrase someone have uttered—“the lion and gladiator will be the next thing " and everyone be feel horrified so that when vronsky fall to the ground and anna moan aloud there be nothing very out of the way in it but afterwards a change come over anna ’s face which really be beyond decorum she utterly lose her head she begin flutter like a caged bird at one moment would have get up and move away at the next turn to betsy " let we go let we go " she say but betsy do not hear she she be bend down talk to a general who have come up to she alexey alexandrovitch go up to anna and courteously offer she his arm " let we go if you like " he say in french but anna be listen to the general and do not notice her husband " he ’ break his leg too so they say " the general be say " this be beyond everything " without answer her husband anna lift her operaglass and gaze towards the place where vronsky have fall but it be so far off and there be such a crowd of people about it that she could make out nothing she lay down the operaglass and would have move away but at that moment an officer gallop up and make some announcement to the tsar anna crane forward listen " stiva stiva " she cry to her brother but her brother do not hear she again she would have move away " once more I offer you my arm if you want to be go " say alexey alexandrovitch reach towards her hand she draw back from he with aversion and without look in his face answer " no no let I be I ’ll stay " she see now that from the place of vronsky ’s accident an officer be run across the course towards the pavilion betsy wave her handkerchief to he the officer bring the news that the rider be not kill but the horse have break its back on hear this anna sit down hurriedly and hide her face in her fan alexey alexandrovitch see that she be weep and could not control her tear nor even the sob that be shake her bosom alexey alexandrovitch stand so as to screen she give she time to recover herself " for the third time I offer you my arm " he say to she after a little time turn to she anna gaze at he and do not know what to say princess betsy come to her rescue " no alexey alexandrovitch I bring anna and I promise to take she home " put in betsy " excuse I princess " he say smile courteously but look she very firmly in the face " but I see that anna ’ not very well and I wish she to come home with I " anna look about she in a frightened way get up submissively and lay her hand on her husband ’s arm " I ’ll send to he and find out and let you know " betsy whisper to she as they leave the pavilion alexey alexandrovitch as always talk to those he meet and anna have as always to talk and answer but she be utterly beside herself and move hang on her husband ’s arm as though in a dream " be he kill or not be it true will he come or not shall I see he today " she be think she take her seat in her husband ’s carriage in silence and in silence drive out of the crowd of carriage in spite of all he have see alexey alexandrovitch still do not allow himself to consider his wife ’s real condition he merely see the outward symptom he see that she be behave unbecomingly and consider it his duty to tell she so but it be very difficult for he not to say more to tell she nothing but that he open his mouth to tell she she have behave unbecomingly but he could not help say something utterly different " what an inclination we all have though for these cruel spectacle " he say " I observe " " eh I do not understand " say anna contemptuously he be offend and at once begin to say what he have mean to say " I be oblige to tell you " he begin " so now we be to have it out " she think and she feel frightened " I be oblige to tell you that your behavior have be unbecoming today " he say to she in french " in what way have my behavior be unbecoming " she say aloud turn her head swiftly and look he straight in the face not with the bright expression that seem cover something but with a look of determination under which she conceal with difficulty the dismay she be feel " mind " he say point to the open window opposite the coachman he get up and pull up the window " what do you consider unbecoming " she repeat " the despair you be unable to conceal at the accident to one of the rider " he wait for she to answer but she be silent look straight before she " I have already beg you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongue can find nothing to say against you there be a time when I speak of your inward attitude but I be not speak of that now now I speak only of your external attitude you have behave improperly and I would wish it not to occur again " she do not hear half of what he be say she feel panicstricken before he and be think whether it be true that vronsky be not kill be it of he they be speak when they say the rider be unhurt but the horse have break its back she merely smile with a pretense of irony when he finish and make no reply because she have not hear what he say alexey alexandrovitch have begin to speak boldly but as he realize plainly what he be speak of the dismay she be feel infect he too he see the smile and a strange misapprehension come over he " she be smile at my suspicion yes she will tell I directly what she tell I before that there be no foundation for my suspicion that it ’ absurd " at that moment when the revelation of everything be hang over he there be nothing he expect so much as that she would answer mockingly as before that his suspicion be absurd and utterly groundless so terrible to he be what he know that now he be ready to believe anything but the expression of her face scared and gloomy do not now promise even deception " possibly I be mistaken " say he " if so I beg your pardon " " no you be not mistaken " she say deliberately look desperately into his cold face " you be not mistaken I be and I could not help be in despair I hear you but I be think of he I love he I be his mistress I can not bear you I ’m afraid of you and I hate you you can do what you like to I " and drop back into the corner of the carriage she break into sob hide her face in her hand alexey alexandrovitch do not stir and keep look straight before he but his whole face suddenly bear the solemn rigidity of the dead and his expression do not change during the whole time of the drive home on reach the house he turn his head to she still with the same expression " very well but I expect a strict observance of the external form of propriety till such time”—his voice shook—“as I may take measure to secure my honor and communicate they to you " he get out first and help she to get out before the servant he press her hand take his seat in the carriage and drive back to petersburg immediately afterwards a footman come from princess betsy and bring anna a note " I send to alexey to find out how he be and he write I he be quite well and unhurt but in despair " " so he will be here " she think " what a good thing I tell he all " she glance at her watch she have still three hour to wait and the memory of their last meeting set her blood in flame " my god how light it be it ’ dreadful but I do love to see his face and I do love this fantastic light my husband oh yes well thank god everything ’ over with he " in the little german wateringplace to which the shtcherbatskys have betake themselves as in all place indeed where people be gather together the usual process as it be of the crystallization of society go on assign to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place just as the particle of water in frost definitely and unalterably take the special form of the crystal of snow so each new person that arrive at the spring be at once place in his special place fürst shtcherbatsky sammt gemahlin und tochter by the apartment they take and from their name and from the friend they make be immediately crystallize into a definite place mark out for they there be visit the wateringplace that year a real german fürstin in consequence of which the crystallizing process go on more vigorously than ever princess shtcherbatskaya wish above everything to present her daughter to this german princess and the day after their arrival she duly perform this rite kitty make a low and graceful curtsey in the very simple that be to say very elegant frock that have be order she from paris the german princess say " I hope the rose will soon come back to this pretty little face " and for the shtcherbatskys certain definite line of existence be at once lay down from which there be no departing the shtcherbatskys make the acquaintance too of the family of an english lady somebody and of a german countess and her son wound in the last war and of a learned swede and of m canut and his sister but yet inevitably the shtcherbatskys be throw most into the society of a moscow lady marya yevgenyevna rtishtcheva and her daughter whom kitty dislike because she have fall ill like herself over a love affair and a moscow colonel whom kitty have know from childhood and always see in uniform and epaulet and who now with his little eye and his open neck and flowered cravat be uncommonly ridiculous and tedious because there be no get rid of he when all this be so firmly establish kitty begin to be very much bored especially as the prince go away to carlsbad and she be leave alone with her mother she take no interest in the people she know feel that nothing fresh would come of they her chief mental interest in the wateringplace consist in watch and make theory about the people she do not know it be characteristic of kitty that she always imagine everything in people in the most favorable light possible especially so in those she do not know and now as she make surmise as to who people be what be their relation to one another and what they be like kitty endow they with the most marvelous and noble character and find confirmation of her idea in her observation of these people the one that attract she most be a russian girl who have come to the wateringplace with an invalid russian lady madame stahl as everyone call she madame stahl belong to the high society but she be so ill that she could not walk and only on exceptionally fine day make her appearance at the spring in an invalid carriage but it be not so much from illhealth as from pride — so princess shtcherbatskaya interpret it — that madame stahl have not make the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there the russian girl look after madame stahl and besides that she be as kitty observe on friendly term with all the invalid who be seriously ill and there be many of they at the spring and look after they in the most natural way this russian girl be not as kitty gather relate to madame stahl nor be she a pay attendant madame stahl call her varenka and other people call she " mademoiselle varenka " apart from the interest kitty take in this girl ’s relation with madame stahl and with other unknown person kitty as often happen feel an inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka and be aware when their eye meet that she too like she of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she have pass her first youth but she be as it be a creature without youth she might have be take for nineteen or for thirty if her feature be criticize separately she be handsome rather than plain in spite of the sickly hue of her face she would have be a good figure too if it have not be for her extreme thinness and the size of her head which be too large for her medium height but she be not likely to be attractive to man she be like a fine flower already past its bloom and without fragrance though the petal be still unwithered moreover she would have be unattractive to man also from the lack of just what kitty have too much of — of the suppress fire of vitality and the consciousness of her own attractiveness she always seem absorb in work about which there could be no doubt and so it seem she could not take interest in anything outside it it be just this contrast with her own position that be for kitty the great attraction of mademoiselle varenka kitty feel that in she in her manner of life she would find an example of what she be now so painfully seek interest in life a dignity in life — apart from the worldly relation of girl with man which so revolt kitty and appear to she now as a shameful hawking about of good in search of a purchaser the more attentively kitty watch her unknown friend the more convinced she be this girl be the perfect creature she fancy she and the more eagerly she wish to make her acquaintance the two girl use to meet several time a day and every time they meet kitty ’s eye say " who be you what be you be you really the exquisite creature I imagine you to be but for goodness ' sake do not suppose " her eye add " that I would force my acquaintance on you I simply admire you and like you " " I like you too and you ’re very very sweet and I should like you well still if I have time " answer the eye of the unknown girl kitty see indeed that she be always busy either she be take the child of a russian family home from the spring or fetch a shawl for a sick lady and wrap she up in it or try to interest an irritable invalid or select and buy cake for tea for someone soon after the arrival of the shtcherbatskys there appear in the morning crowd at the springs two person who attract universal and unfavorable attention these be a tall man with a stooping figure and huge hand in an old coat too short for he with black simple and yet terrible eye and a pockmarked kindlooking woman very badly and tastelessly dress recognize these person as russians kitty have already in her imagination begin construct a delightful and touching romance about they but the princess have ascertain from the visitor ' list that this be nikolay levin and marya nikolaevna explain to kitty what a bad man this levin be and all her fancy about these two people vanish not so much from what her mother tell she as from the fact that it be konstantin ’s brother this pair suddenly seem to kitty intensely unpleasant this levin with his continual twitching of his head arouse in she now an irrepressible feeling of disgust it seem to she that his big terrible eye which persistently pursue she express a feeling of hatred and contempt and she try to avoid meet he it be a wet day it have be rain all the morning and the invalid with their parasol have flock into the arcade kitty be walk there with her mother and the moscow colonel smart and jaunty in his european coat buy readymade at frankfort they be walk on

funny to see your engouement " say the princess " no we ’d well go back " she add notice levin come towards they with his companion and a german doctor to whom he be talk very noisily and angrily they turn to go back when suddenly they hear not noisy talk but shout levin stop short be shout at the doctor and the doctor too be excited a crowd gather about they the princess and kitty beat a hasty retreat while the colonel join the crowd to find out what be the matter a few minute later the colonel overtake they " what be it " inquire the princess " scandalous and disgraceful " answer the

it ’ all so unimportant " " why what be important " say kitty look into her face with inquisitive wonder " oh there ’ so much that ’ important " say varenka smile " why what " " oh so much that ’ more important " answer varenka not know what to say but at that instant they hear the princess ’s voice from the window " kitty it ’ cold either get a shawl or come indoors " " it really be time to go in " say varenka get up " I have to go on to madame berthe ’s she ask I to " kitty hold she by the hand and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eye ask she " what be it what be this of such importance that give you such tranquillity you know tell I " but varenka do not even know what kitty ’s eye be ask she she merely think that she have to go to see madame berthe too that evening and to make haste home in time for maman ’s tea at twelve o’clock she go indoors collect her music and say goodbye to everyone be about to go " allow I to see you home " say the colonel " yes how can you go alone at night like this " chime in the princess " anyway I ’ll send parasha " kitty see that varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she need an escort " no I always go about alone and nothing ever happen to I " she say take her hat and kiss kitty once more without say what be important she step out courageously with the music under her arm and vanish into the twilight of the summer night bear away with she her secret of what be important and what give she the calm and dignity so much to be envy kitty make the acquaintance of madame stahl too and this acquaintance together with her friendship with varenka do not merely exercise a great influence on she it also comfort she in her mental distress she find this comfort through a completely new world be open to she by mean of this acquaintance a world have nothing in common with she past an exalted noble world from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly it be reveal to she that besides the instinctive life to which kitty have give herself up hitherto there be a spiritual life this life be disclose in religion but a religion have nothing in common with that one which kitty have know from childhood and which find expression in litany and allnight service at the widow ’s home where one might meet one ’s friend and in learn by heart slavonic text with the priest this be a lofty mysterious religion connect with a whole series of noble thought and feeling which one could do more than merely believe because one be tell to which one could love kitty find all this out not from word madame stahl talk to kitty as to a charming child that one look on with pleasure as on the memory of one ’s youth and only once she say in passing that in all human sorrow nothing give comfort but love and faith and that in the sight of christ ’s compassion for we no sorrow be trifling — and immediately talk of other thing but in every gesture of madame stahl in every word in every heavenly — as kitty call it — look and above all in the whole story of her life which she hear from varenka kitty recognize that something " that be important " of which till then she have know nothing yet elevated as madame stahl ’s character be touch as be her story and exalted and moving as be her speech kitty could not help detect in she some trait which perplex she she notice that when question she about her family madame stahl have smile contemptuously which be not in accord with christian meekness she notice too that when she have find a catholic priest with she madame stahl have studiously keep her face in the shadow of the lampshade and have smile in a peculiar way trivial as these two observation be they perplex she and she have her doubt as to madame stahl but on the other hand varenka alone in the world without friend or relation with a melancholy disappointment in the past desire nothing regret nothing be just that perfection of which kitty dare hardly dream in varenka she realize that one have but to forget oneself and love other and one will be calm happy and noble and that be what kitty long to be see now clearly what be the most important kitty be not satisfied with be enthusiastic over it she at once give herself up with her whole soul to the new life that be open to she from varenka ’s account of the doing of madame stahl and other people whom she mention kitty have already construct the plan of her own future life she would like madame stahl ’s niece aline of whom varenka have talk to she a great deal seek out those who be in trouble wherever she might be live help they as far as she could give they the gospel read the gospel to the sick to criminal to the die the idea of read the gospel to criminal as aline do particularly fascinate kitty but all these be secret dream of which kitty do not talk either to her mother or to varenka while await the time for carry out her plan on a large scale however kitty even then at the springs where there be so many people ill and unhappy readily find a chance for practice her new principle in imitation of varenka at first the princess notice nothing but that kitty be much under the influence of her engouement as she call it for madame stahl and still more for varenka she see that kitty do not merely imitate varenka in her conduct but unconsciously imitate she in her manner of walk of talk of blink her eye but later on the princess notice that apart from this adoration some kind of serious spiritual change be take place in her daughter the princess see that in the evening kitty read a french testament that madame stahl have give she — a thing she have never do before that she avoid society acquaintance and associate with the sick people who be under varenka ’s protection and especially one poor family that of a sick painter petrov kitty be unmistakably proud of play the part of a sister of mercy in that you all this be well enough and the princess have nothing to say against it especially as petrov ’s wife be a perfectly nice sort of woman and that the german princess notice kitty ’s devotion praise she call she an angel of consolation all this would have be very well if there have be no exaggeration but the princess see that her daughter be rush into extreme and so indeed she tell she " il ne faut jamais rien outrer " she say to she her daughter make she no reply only in her heart she think that one could not talk about exaggeration where christianity be concern what exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one be bid to turn the other cheek when one be smite and give one ’s cloak if one ’s coat be take but the princess dislike this exaggeration and dislike even more the fact that she feel her daughter do not care to show she all her heart kitty do in fact conceal her new view and feeling from her mother she conceal they not because she do not respect or do not love her mother but simply because she be her mother she would have reveal they to anyone soon than to her mother " how be it anna pavlovna ’ not be to see we for so long " the princess say one day of madame petrova " I ’ve ask she but she seem put out about something " " no I ’ve not notice it maman " say kitty flush hotly " be it long since you go to see they " " we ’re mean to make an expedition to the mountain tomorrow " answer kitty " well you can go " answer the princess gaze at her daughter ’s embarrassed face and try to guess the cause of her embarrassment that day varenka come to dinner and tell they that anna pavlovna have change her mind and give up the expedition for the morrow and the princess notice again that kitty redden " kitty have not you have some misunderstanding with the petrovs " say the princess when they be leave alone " why have she give up send the child and come to see we " kitty answer that nothing have happen between they and that she could not tell why anna pavlovna seem displeased with she kitty answer perfectly truly she do not know the reason anna pavlovna have change to she but she guess it she guess at something which she could not tell her mother which she do not put into word to herself it be one of those thing which one know but which one can never speak of even to oneself so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistake again and again she go over in her you all her relation with the family she remember the simple delight express on the round goodhumored face of anna pavlovna at their meeting she remember their secret confabulation about the invalid their plot to draw he away from the work which be forbid he and to get he outofdoors the devotion of the young boy who use to call she " my kitty " and would not go to bed without she how nice it all be then she recall the thin terribly thin figure of petrov with his long neck in his brown coat his scant curly hair his questioning blue eye that be so terrible to kitty at first and his painful attempt to seem hearty and lively in her presence she recall the effort she have make at first to overcome the repugnance she feel for he as for all consumptive people and the pain it have cost she to think of thing to say to he she recall the timid softened look with which he gaze at she and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness and later of a sense of her own goodness which she have feel at it how nice it all be but all that be at first now a few day ago everything be suddenly spoiled anna pavlovna have meet kitty with affected cordiality and have keep continual watch on she and on her husband could that touching pleasure he show when she come near be the cause of anna pavlovna ’s coolness " yes " she muse " there be something unnatural about anna pavlovna and utterly unlike her good nature when she say angrily the day before yesterday ' there he will keep wait for you he would not drink his coffee without you though he ’ grow so dreadfully weak ' " " yes perhaps too she do not like it when I give he the rug it be all so simple but he take it so awkwardly and be so long thank I that I feel awkward too and then that portrait of I he do so well and most of all that look of confusion and tenderness yes yes that ’ it " kitty repeat to herself with horror " no it can not be it ought not to be he ’ so much to be pity " she say to herself directly after this doubt poison the charm of her new life before the end of the course of drink the waters prince shtcherbatsky who have go on from carlsbad to baden and kissingen to russian friend — to get a breath of russian air as he say — come back to his wife and daughter the view of the prince and of the princess on life abroad be completely oppose the princess think everything delightful and in spite of her establish position in russian society she try abroad to be like a european fashionable lady which she be not — for the simple reason that she be a typical russian gentlewoman and so she be affect which do not altogether suit she the prince on the contrary think everything foreign detestable get sick of european life keep to his russian habit and purposely try to show himself abroad less european than he be in reality the prince return thin with the skin hang in loose bag on his cheek but in the most cheerful frame of mind his good humor be even great when he see kitty completely recover the news of kitty ’s friendship with madame stahl and varenka and the report the princess give he of some kind of change she have notice in kitty trouble the prince and arouse his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that draw his daughter away from he and a dread that his daughter might have get out of the reach of his influence into region inaccessible to he but these unpleasant matter be all drown in the sea of kindliness and good humor which be always within he and more so than ever since his course of carlsbad water the day after his arrival the prince in his long overcoat with his russian wrinkle and baggy cheek prop up by a starched collar set off with his daughter to the spring in the great good humor it be a lovely morning the bright cheerful house with their little garden the sight of the redfaced redarmed beerdrinke german waitress work away merrily do the heart good but the near they get to the spring the oftener they meet sick people and their appearance seem more pitiable than ever among the everyday condition of prosperous german life kitty be no long strike by this contrast the bright sun the brilliant green of the foliage the strain of the music be for she the natural setting of all these familiar face with their change to great emaciation or to convalescence for which she watch but to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the june morning and the sound of the orchestra play a gay waltz then in fashion and above all the appearance of the healthy attendant seem something unseemly and monstrous in conjunction with these slowly move die figure gather together from all part of europe in spite of his feeling of pride and as it be of the return of youth with his favorite daughter on his arm he feel awkward and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy stout limb he feel almost like a

shall never marry " " well then I shall never come " " well then I shall be marry simply for that mind now remember your promise " say kitty the doctor ’s prediction be fulfil kitty return home to russia cure she be not so gay and thoughtless as before but she be serene her moscow trouble have become a memory to her sergey ivanovitch koznishev want a rest from mental work and instead of go abroad as he usually do he come towards the end of may to stay in the country with his brother in his judgment the good sort of life be a country life he have come now to enjoy such a life at his brother ’s konstantin levin be very glad to have he especially as he do not expect his brother nikolay that summer but in spite of his affection and respect for sergey ivanovitch konstantin levin be uncomfortable with his brother in the country it make he uncomfortable and it positively annoy he to see his brother ’s attitude to the country to konstantin levin the country be the background of life that be of pleasure endeavor labor to sergey ivanovitch the country mean on one hand rest from work on the other a valuable antidote to the corrupt influence of town which he take with satisfaction and a sense of its utility to konstantin levin the country be good first because it afford a field for labor of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt to sergey ivanovitch the country be particularly good because there it be possible and fitting to do nothing moreover sergey ivanovitch ’s attitude to the peasant rather pique konstantin sergey ivanovitch use to say that he know and like the peasantry and he often talk to the peasant which he know how to do without affectation or condescension and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusion in favor of the peasantry and in confirmation of his know they konstantin levin do not like such an attitude to the peasant to konstantin the peasant be simply the chief partner in their common labor and in spite of all the respect and the love almost like that of kinship he have for the peasant — suck in probably as he say himself with the milk of his peasant nurse — still as a fellowworker with he while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor gentleness and justice of these man he be very often when their common labor call for other quality exasperate with the peasant for his carelessness lack of method drunkenness and lying if he have be ask whether he like or do not like the peasant konstantin levin would have be absolutely at a loss what to reply he like and do not like the peasant just as he like and do not like man in general of course be a goodhearted man he like man rather than he dislike they and so too with the peasant but like or dislike " the people " as something apart he could not not only because he live with " the people " and all his interest be bind up with theirs but also because he regard himself as a part of " the people " do not see any special quality or failing distinguish himself and " the people " and could not contrast himself with they moreover although he have live so long in the close relation with the peasant as farmer and arbitrator and what be more as adviser the peasant trust he and for thirty mile round they would come to ask his advice he have no definite view of " the people " and would have be as much at a loss to answer the question whether he know " the people " as the question whether he like they for he to say he know the peasantry would have be the same as to say he know man he be continually watch and get to know people of all sort and among they peasant whom he regard as good and interesting people and he be continually observe new point in they alter his former view of they and form new one with sergey ivanovitch it be quite the contrary just as he like and praise a country life in comparison with the life he do not like so too he like the peasantry in contradistinction to the class of man he do not like and so too he know the peasantry as something distinct from and oppose to man generally in his methodical brain there be distinctly formulate certain aspect of peasant life deduce partly from that life itself but chiefly from contrast with other mode of life he never change his opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards they in the discussion that arise between the brother on their view of the peasantry sergey ivanovitch always get the well of his brother precisely because sergey ivanovitch have definite idea about the peasant — his character his quality and his taste konstantin levin have no definite and unalterable idea on the subject and so in their argument konstantin be readily convict of contradict himself in sergey ivanovitch ’s eye his young brother be a capital fellow with his heart in the right place as he express it in french but with a mind which though fairly quick be too much influence by the impression of the moment and consequently fill with contradiction with all the condescension of an eld brother he sometimes explain to he the true import of thing but he derive little satisfaction from argue with he because he get the better of he too easily konstantin levin regard his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture as generous in the high sense of the word and possess of a special faculty for work for the public good but in the depth of his heart the old he become and the more intimately he know his brother the more and more frequently the thought strike he that this faculty of work for the public good of which he feel himself utterly devoid be possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something — not a lack of good honest noble desire and taste but a lack of vital force of what be call heart of that impulse which drive a man to choose someone out of the innumerable path of life and to care only for that one the well he know his brother the more he notice that sergey ivanovitch and many other people who work for the public welfare be not lead by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good but reason from intellectual consideration that it be a right thing to take interest in public affair and consequently take interest in they levin be confirm in this generalization by observe that his brother do not take question affect the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he do chess problem or the ingenious construction of a new machine besides this konstantin levin be not at his ease with his brother because in summer in the country levin be continually busy with work on the land and the long summer day be not long enough for he to get through all he have to do while sergey ivanovitch be take a holiday but though he be take a holiday now that be to say he be do no writing he be so used to intellectual activity that he like to put into concise and eloquent shape the idea that occur to he and like to have someone to listen to he his most usual and natural listener be his brother and so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relation konstantin feel an awkwardness in leave he alone sergey ivanovitch like to stretch himself on the grass in the sun and to lie so bask and chat lazily " you would not believe " he would say to his brother " what a pleasure this rural laziness be to I not an idea in one ’s brain as empty as a drum " but konstantin levin find it dull sit and listen to he especially when he know that while he be away they would be cart dung onto the field not plough ready for it and heap it all up anyhow and would not screw the share in the plough but would let they come off and then say that the new plough be a silly invention and there be nothing like the old andreevna plough and so on " come you ’ve do enough trudging about in the heat " sergey ivanovitch would say to he " no I must just run round to the countinghouse for a minute " levin would answer and he would run off to the field early in june it happen that agafea mihalovna the old nurse and housekeeper in carry to the cellar a jar of mushroom she have just pickle slip fall and sprain her wrist the district doctor a talkative young medical student who have just finish his study come to see she he examine the wrist say it be not break be delight at a chance of talk to the celebrated sergey ivanovitch koznishev and to show his advanced view of thing tell he all the scandal of the district complain of the poor state into which the district council have fall sergey ivanovitch listen attentively ask he question and rouse by a new listener he talk fluently utter a few keen and weighty observation respectfully appreciate by the young doctor and be soon in that eager frame of mind his brother know so well which always with he follow a brilliant and eager conversation after the departure of the doctor he want to go with a fishing rod to the river sergey ivanovitch be fond of angling and be it seem proud of be able to care for such a stupid occupation konstantin levin whose presence be need in the plough land and meadow have come to take his brother in the trap it be that time of the year the turningpoint of summer when the crop of the present year be a certainty when one begin to think of the sowing for next year and the mowing be at hand when the rye be all in ear though its ear be still light not yet full and it wave in graygreen billow in the wind when the green oats with tuft of yellow grass scatter here and there among it droop irregularly over the latesown field when the early buckwheat be already out and hide the ground when the fallow land tread hard as stone by the cattle be half plough over with path leave untouched by the plough when from the dry dungheap cart onto the field there come at sunset a smell of manure mix with meadowsweet and on the lowlying land the riverside meadow be a thick sea of grass wait for the mowing with blackened heap of the stalk of sorrel among it it be the time when there come a brief pause in the toil of the field before the beginning of the labor of harvest — every year recur every year strain every nerve of the peasant the crop be a splendid one and bright hot summer day have set in with short dewy night the brother have to drive through the wood to reach the meadow sergey ivanovitch be all the while admire the beauty of the wood which be a tangled mass of leave point out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flower dark on the shady side and brightly spotted with yellow stipule now the young shoot of this year ’s sapling brilliant with emerald konstantin levin do not like talk and hear about the beauty of nature word for he take away the beauty of what he see he assent to what his brother say but he could not help begin to think of other thing when they come out of the wood all his attention be engross by the view of the fallow land on the upland in part yellow with grass in part trample and checker with furrow in part dot with ridge of dung and in part even plough a string of cart be move across it levin count the cart and be pleased that all that be want have be bring and at the sight of the meadow his thought pass to the mowing he always feel something special move he to the quick at the haymaking on reach the meadow levin stop the horse the morning dew be still lie on the thick undergrowth of the grass and that he might not get his foot wet sergey ivanovitch ask his brother to drive he in the trap up to the willow tree from which the carp be catch sorry as konstantin levin be to crush down his mow grass he drive he into the meadow the high grass softly turn about the wheel and the horse ’s leg leave its seed cling to the wet axle and spoke of the wheel his brother seat himself under a bush arrange his tackle while levin lead the horse away fasten he up and walk into the vast graygreen sea of grass unstirred by the wind the silky grass with its ripe seed come almost to his waist in the damp spot cross the meadow konstantin levin come out onto the road and meet an old man with a swollen eye carry a skep on his shoulder " what take a stray swarm fomitch " he ask " no indeed konstantin dmitrich all we can do to keep our own this be the second swarm that have fly away luckily the lad catch they they be plough your field they unyoke the horse and gallop after they " " well what do you say fomitch — start mow or wait a bit " " eh well our way ’ to wait till st peter ’s day but you always mow soon well to be sure please god the hay ’ good there ’ll be plenty for the beast " " what do you think about the weather " " that ’ in god ’s hand maybe it will be fine " levin go up to his brother sergey ivanovitch have catch nothing but he be not bored and seem in the most cheerful frame of mind levin see that stimulate by his conversation with the doctor he want to talk levin on the other hand would have like to get home as soon as possible to give order about get together the mower for next day and to set at rest his doubt about the mowing which greatly absorb he " well let ’s be go " he say " why be in such a hurry let ’s stay a little but how wet you be even though one catch nothing it ’ nice that ’ the good thing about every part of sport that one have to do with nature how exquisite this steely water be " say sergey ivanovitch " these riverside bank always remind I of the riddle — do you know it ' the grass say to the water we quiver and we quiver ' " " I do not know the riddle " answer levin wearily " do you know I ’ve be think about you " say sergey ivanovitch " it ’ beyond everything what ’ be do in the district accord to what this doctor tell I he ’ a very intelligent fellow and as I ’ve tell you before I tell you again it ’ not right for you not to go to the meeting and altogether to keep out of the district business if decent people will not go into it of course it ’ bind to go all wrong we pay the money and it all go in salary and there be no school nor district nurse nor midwife nor drugstore — nothing " " well I do try you know " levin say slowly and unwillingly " I can not and so there ’ no help for it " " but why can n’t you I must own I can not make it out indifference incapacity — I will not admit surely it ’ not simply laziness " " none of those thing I ’ve try and I see I can do nothing " say levin he have hardly grasp what his brother be say look towards the plough land across the river he make out something black but he could not distinguish whether it be a horse or the bailiff on horseback " why be it you can do nothing you make an attempt and do not succeed as you think and you give in how can you have so little selfrespect " " selfrespect " say levin stung to the quick by his brother ’s word " I do not understand if they ’d tell I at college that other people understand the integral calculus and I do not then pride would have come in but in this case one want first to be convince that one have certain qualification for this sort of business and especially that all this business be of great importance " " what do you mean to say it ’ not of importance " say sergey ivanovitch sting to the quick too at his brother ’s consider anything of no importance that interest he and still more at his obviously pay little attention to what he be say " I do not think it important it do not take hold of I I can not help it " answer levin make out that what he see be the bailiff and that the bailiff seem to be let the peasant go off the plough land they be turn the plough over " can they have finish plough " he wonder " come really though " say the eld brother with a frown on his handsome clever face " there ’ a limit to everything it ’ very well to be original and genuine and to dislike everything conventional — I know all about that but really what you ’re say either have no meaning or it have a very wrong meaning how can you think it a matter of no importance whether the peasant whom you love as you assert " " I never do assert it " think konstantin levin " die without help the ignorant peasantwoman starve the child and the people stagnate in darkness and be helpless in the hand of every village clerk while you have at your disposal a means of help they and do not help they because to your mind it ’ of no importance " and sergey ivanovitch put before he the alternative either you be so undeveloped that you can not see all that you can do or you will not sacrifice your ease your vanity or whatever it be to do it konstantin levin feel that there be no course open to he but to submit or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good and this mortify he and hurt his feeling " it ’ both " he say resolutely " I do not see that it be possible " " what be it impossible if the money be properly lay out to provide medical aid " " impossible as it seem to I for the three thousand square mile of our district what with our thaw and the storm and the work in the field I do not see how it be possible to provide medical aid all over and besides I do not believe in medicine " " oh well that ’ unfair   I can quote to you thousand of instance but the school anyway " " why have school " " what do you mean can there be two opinion of the advantage of education if it ’ a good thing for you it ’ a good thing for everyone " konstantin levin feel himself morally pin against a wall and so he get hot and unconsciously blurt out the chief cause of his indifference to public business " perhaps it you all be very good but why should I worry myself about establish dispensary which I shall never make use of and school to which I shall never send my child to which even the peasant do not want to send their child and to which I ’ve no very firm faith that they ought to send they " say he sergey ivanovitch be for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject but he promptly make a new plan of attack he be silent for a little draw out a hook throw it in again and turn to his brother smile " come now in the first place the dispensary be need we ourselves send for the district doctor for agafea mihalovna " " oh well but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again " " that remain to be prove next the peasant who can read and write be as a workman of more use and value to you " " no you can ask anyone you like " konstantin levin answer with decision " the man that can read and write be much inferior as a workman and mend the highroad be an impossibility and as soon as they put up bridge they ’re steal " " still that ’ not the point " say sergey ivanovitch frown he dislike contradiction and still more argument that be continually skip from one thing to another introduce new and disconnected point so that there be no knowing to which to reply " do you admit that education be a benefit for the people " " yes I admit it " say levin without think and he be conscious immediately that he have say what he do not think he feel that if he admit that it would be prove that he have be talk meaningless rubbish how it would be prove he could not tell but he know that this would inevitably be logically prove to he and he await the proof the argument turn out to be far simple than he have expect " if you admit that it be a benefit " say sergey ivanovitch " then as an honest man you can not help care about it and sympathize with the movement and so wish to work for it " " but I still do not admit this movement to be just " say konstantin levin redden a little " what but you say just now " " that ’ to say I do not admit it ’ be either good or possible " " that you can not tell without make the trial " " well suppose that ’ so " say levin though he do not suppose so at all " suppose that be so still I do not see all the same what I ’m to worry myself about it for " " how so " " no since we be talk explain it to I from the philosophical point of view " say levin " I can not see where philosophy come in " say sergey ivanovitch in a tone levin fancy as though he do not admit his brother ’s right to talk about philosophy and that irritate levin " I ’ll tell you then " he say with heat " I imagine the mainspring of all our action be after all selfinterest now in the local institution I as a nobleman see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity and the road be not well and could not be well my horse carry I well enough over bad one doctor and dispensary be no use to I an arbitrator of dispute be no use to I I never appeal to he and never shall appeal to he the school be no good to I but positively harmful as I tell you for I the district institution simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acre to drive into the town sleep with bug and listen to all sort of idiocy and loathsomeness and selfinterest offer I no inducement " " excuse I " sergey ivanovitch interpose with a smile " selfinterest do not induce we to work for the emancipation of the serf but we do work for it " " no " konstantin levin break in with still great heat " the emancipation of the serf be a different matter there selfinterest do come in one long to throw off that yoke that crush we all decent people among we but to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustman be need and how chimney shall be construct in the town in which I do not live — to serve on a jury and try a peasant who ’ steal a flitch of bacon and listen for six hour at a stretch to all sort of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution and the president crossexamining my old halfwitted alioshka ' do you admit prisoner in the dock the fact of the removal of the bacon ' ' eh ' " konstantin levin have warm to his subject and begin mimic the president and the halfwitted alioshka it seem to he that it be all to the point but sergey ivanovitch shrug his shoulder " well what do you mean to say then " " I simply mean to say that those right that touch I   my interest I shall always defend to the good of my ability that when they make raid on we student and the police read our letter I be ready to defend those right to the utmost to defend my right to education and freedom I can understand compulsory military service which affect my child my brother and myself I be ready to deliberate on what concern I but deliberate on how to spend forty thousand rouble of district council money or judge the halfwitted alioshka — I do not understand and I can not do it " konstantin levin speak as though the floodgate of his speech have burst open sergey ivanovitch smile " but tomorrow it ’ll be your turn to be try would it have suit your taste well to be try in the old criminal tribunal " " I ’m not go to be try I shall not murder anybody and I ’ve no need of it well I tell you what " he go on fly off again to a subject quite beside the point " our district selfgovernment and all the rest of it — it ’ just like the birch branch we stick in the ground on trinity day for instance to look like a copse which have grow up of itself in europe and I can not gush over these birch branch and believe in they " sergey ivanovitch merely shrug his shoulder as though to express his wonder how the birch branch have come into their argument at that point though he do really understand at once what his brother mean " excuse I but you know one really can not argue in that way " he observe but konstantin levin want to justify himself for the failing of which he be conscious of lack of zeal for the public welfare and he go on " I imagine " he say " that no sort of activity be likely to be lasting if it be not found on selfinterest that ’ a universal principle a philosophical principle " he say repeat the word " philosophical " with determination as though wish to show that he have as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy sergey ivanovitch smile " he too have a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendency " he think " come you ’d well let philosophy alone " he say " the chief problem of the philosophy of all age consist just in find the indispensable connection which exist between individual and social interest but that ’ not to the point what be to the point be a correction I must make in your comparison the birch be not simply stick in but some be sow and some be plant and one must deal carefully with they it ’ only those people that have an intuitive sense of what ’ of importance and significance in their institution and know how to value they that have a future before they — it ’ only those people that one can truly call historical " and sergey ivanovitch carry the subject into the region of philosophical history where konstantin levin could not follow he and show he all the incorrectness of his view " as for your dislike of it excuse my say so that ’ simply our russian sloth and old serfowner ’s way and I ’m convinced that in you it ’ a temporary error and will pass " konstantin be silent he feel himself vanquish on all side but he feel at the same time that what he want to say be unintelligible to his brother only he could not make up his mind whether it be unintelligible because he be not capable of express his meaning clearly or because his brother would not or could not understand he but he do not pursue the speculation and without reply he fall to muse on a quite different and personal matter sergey ivanovitch wind up the last line untie the horse and they drive off the personal matter that absorb levin during his conversation with his brother be this once in a previous year he have go to look at the mowing and be make very angry by the bailiff he have recourse to his favorite mean for regain his temper — he take a scythe from a peasant and begin mow he like the work so much that he have several time try his hand at mowing since he have cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house and this year ever since the early spring he have cherish a plan for mow for whole day together with the peasant ever since his brother ’s arrival he have be in doubt whether to mow or not he be loath to leave his brother alone all day long and he be afraid his brother would laugh at he about it but as he drive into the meadow and recall the sensation of mowing he come near decide that he would go mow after the irritating discussion with his brother he ponder over this intention again " I must have physical exercise or my temper’ll certainly be ruin " he think and he determine he would go mow however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasant towards evening konstantin levin go to his counting house give direction as to the work to be do and send about the village to summon the mower for the morrow to cut the hay in kalinov meadow the large and good of his grass land " and send my scythe please to tit for he to set it and bring it round tomorrow I shall maybe do some mowing myself too " he say try not to be embarrassed the bailiff smile and say " yes sir " at tea the same evening levin say to his brother " I fancy the fine weather will last tomorrow I shall start mow " " I ’m so fond of that form of field labor " say sergey ivanovitch " I ’m awfully fond of it I sometimes mow myself with the peasant and tomorrow I want to try mow the whole day " sergey ivanovitch lift his head and look with interest at his brother " how do you mean just like one of the peasant all day long " " yes it ’ very pleasant " say levin " it ’ splendid as exercise only you ’ll hardly be able to stand it " say sergey ivanovitch without a shade of irony " I ’ve try it it ’ hard work at first but you get into it I dare say I shall manage to keep it up " " really what an idea but tell I how do the peasant look at it I suppose they laugh in their sleeve at their master ’s be such a queer fish " " no I do not think so but it ’ so delightful and at the same time such hard work that one have no time to think about it " " but how will you do about dine with they to send you a bottle of lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward " " no I ’ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest " next morning konstantin levin get up early than usual but he be detain give direction on the farm and when he reach the mow grass the mower be already at their second row from the upland he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below with its grayish ridge of cut grass and the black heap of coat take off by the mower at the place from which they have start cut gradually as he ride towards the meadow the peasant come into sight some in coat some in their shirt mow one behind another in a long stre swinge their scythe differently he count fortytwo of they they be mow slowly over the uneven lowlying part of the meadow where there have be an old dam levin recognize some of his own man here be old yermil in a very long white smock bend forward to swing a scythe there be a young fellow vaska who have be a coachman of levin ’s take every row with a wide sweep here too be tit levin ’s preceptor in the art of mow a thin little peasant he be in front of all and cut his wide row without bend as though play with the scythe levin get off his mare and fasten she up by the roadside go to meet tit who take a second scythe out of a bush and give it to he " it ’ ready sir it ’ like a razor cut of itself " say tit take off his cap with a smile and give he the scythe levin take the scythe and begin try it as they finish their row the mower hot and goodhumored come out into the road one after another and laugh a little greet the master you all stare at he but no one make any remark till a tall old man with a wrinkled beardless face wear a short sheepskin jacket come out into the road and accost he " look’ee now master once take hold of the rope there ’ no let it go " he say and levin hear smother laughter among the mower " I ’ll try not to let it go " he say take his stand behind tit and wait for the time to begin " mind’ee " repeat the old man tit make room and levin start behind he the grass be short close to the road and levin who have not do any mowing for a long while and be disconcerted by the eye fasten upon he cut badly for the first moment though he swing his scythe vigorously behind he he hear voice " it ’ not set right handle ’ too high see how he have to stoop to it " say one " press more on the heel " say another " never mind he ’ll get on all right " the old man resume " he ’ make a start you swing it too wide you ’ll tire yourself out the master sure do his good for himself but see the grass miss out for such work we fellow would catch it " the grass become soft and levin listen without answer follow tit try to do the good he could they move a hundred pace tit keep move on without stop not show the slight weariness but levin be already begin to be afraid he would not be able to keep it up he be so tired he feel as he swing his scythe that he be at the very end of his strength and be make up his mind to ask tit to stop but at that very moment tit stop of his own accord and stoop down pick up some grass rub his scythe and begin whet it levin straighten himself and draw a deep breath look round behind he come a peasant and he too be evidently tired for he stop at once without wait to mow up to levin and begin whet his scythe tit sharpen his scythe and levin ’s and they go on the next time it be just the same tit move on with sweep after sweep of his scythe not stop nor show sign of weariness levin follow he try not to get leave behind and he find it hard and hard the moment come when he feel he have no strength leave but at that very moment tit stop and whet the scythe so they mow the first row and this long row seem particularly hard work to levin but when the end be reach and tit shoulder his scythe begin with deliberate stride return on the track leave by his heel in the cut grass and levin walk back in the same way over the space he have cut in spite of the sweat that run in stream over his face and fall in drop down his nose and drench his back as though he have be soak in water he feel very happy what delight he particularly be that now he know he would be able to hold out his pleasure be only disturb by his row not be well cut " I will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body " he think compare tit ’s row which look as if it have be cut with a line with his own unevenly and irregularly lie grass the first row as levin notice tit have mow specially quickly probably wish to put his master to the test and the row happen to be a long one the next row be easy but still levin have to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasant he think of nothing wish for nothing but not to be leave behind the peasant and to do his work as well as possible he hear nothing but the swish of scythe and see before he tit ’s upright figure mow away the crescentshaped curve of the cut grass the grass and flower head slowly and rhythmically fall before the blade of his scythe and ahead of he the end of the row where would come the rest suddenly in the midst of his toil without understand what it be or whence it come he feel a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot moist shoulder he glance at the sky in the interval for whet the scythe a heavy lower storm cloud have blow up and big raindrop be fall some of the peasant go to their coat and put they on other — just like levin himself — merely shrug their shoulder enjoy the pleasant coolness of it another row and yet another row follow — long row and short row with good grass and with poor grass levin lose all sense of time and could not have tell whether it be late or early now a change begin to come over his work which give he immense satisfaction in the midst of his toil there be moment during which he forget what he be do and it come all easy to he and at those same moment his row be almost as smooth and well cut as tit ’s but so soon as he recollect what he be do and begin try to do well he be at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task and the row be badly mow on finish yet another row he would have go back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next but tit stop and go up to the old man say something in a low voice to he they both look at the sun " what be they talk about and why do not he go back " think levin not guess that the peasant have be mow no less than four hour without stop and it be time for their lunch " lunch sir " say the old man " be it really time that ’ right lunch then " levin give his scythe to tit and together with the peasant who be cross the long stretch of mown grass slightly sprinkle with rain to get their bread from the heap of coat he go towards his house only then he suddenly awake to the fact that he have be wrong about the weather and the rain be drench his hay " the hay will be spoil " he say " not a bit of it sir mow in the rain and you ’ll rake in fine weather " say the old man levin untie his horse and ride home to his coffee sergey ivanovitch be only just get up when he have drink his coffee levin ride back again to the mowing before sergey ivanovitch have have time to dress and come down to the diningroom after lunch levin be not in the same place in the string of mower as before but stand between the old man who have accost he jocosely and now invite he to be his neighbor and a young peasant who have only be marry in the autumn and who be mow this summer for the first time the old man hold himself erect move in front with his foot turn out take long regular stride and with a precise and regular action which seem to cost he no more effort than swinge one ’s arm in walk as though it be in play he lay down the high even row of grass it be as though it be not he but the sharp scythe of itself swish through the juicy grass behind levin come the lad mishka his pretty boyish face with a twist of fresh grass bind round his hair be all work with effort but whenever anyone look at he he smile he would clearly have die soon than own it be hard work for he levin keep between they in the very heat of the day the mowing do not seem such hard work to he the perspiration with which he be drench cool he while the sun that burn his back his head and his arm bare to the elbow give a vigor and dogged energy to his labor and more and more often now come those moment of unconsciousness when it be possible not to think what one be do the scythe cut of itself these be happy moment still more delightful be the moment when they reach the stream where the row end and the old man rub his scythe with the wet thick grass rinse its blade in the fresh water of the stream ladle out a little in a tin dipper and offer levin a drink " what do you say to my homebrew eh good eh " say he wink and truly levin have never drink any liquor so good as this warm water with green bit float in it and a taste of rust from the tin dipper and immediately after this come the delicious slow saunter with his hand on the scythe during which he could wipe away the stream sweat take deep breath of air and look about at the long string of mower and at what be happen around in the forest and the country the long levin mow the oftener he feel the moment of unconsciousness in which it seem not his hand that swing the scythe but the scythe mowing of itself a body full of life and consciousness of its own and as though by magic without think of it the work turn out regular and wellfinished of itself these be the most blissful moment it be only hard work when he have to break off the motion which have become unconscious and to think when he have to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel the old man do this easily when a hillock come he change his action and at one time with the heel and at another with the tip of his scythe clip the hillock round both side with short stroke and while he do this he keep look about and watch what come into his view at one moment he pick a wild berry and eat it or offer it to levin then he fling away a twig with the blade of the scythe then he look at a quail ’s nest from which the bird fly just under the scythe or catch a snake that cross his path and lift it on the scythe as though on a fork show it to levin and throw it away for both levin and the young peasant behind he such change of position be difficult both of they repeat over and over again the same strained movement be in a perfect frenzy of toil and be incapable of shift their position and at the same time watch what be before they levin do not notice how time be pass if he have be ask how long he have be work he would have say half an hour — and it be get on for dinner time as they be walk back over the cut grass the old man call levin ’s attention to the little girl and boy who be come from different direction hardly visible through the long grass and along the road towards the mower carry sack of bread drag at their little hand and pitcher of the sour ryebeer with cloth wrap round they " look’ee the little emmet crawl " he say point to they and he shade his eye with his hand to look at the sun they mow two more row the old man stop " come master dinner time " he say briskly and on reach the stream the mower move off across the line of cut grass towards their pile of coat where the child who have bring their dinner be sit wait for they the peasant gather into group — those far away under a cart those near under a willow bush levin sit down by they he feel disinclined to go you all constraint with the master have disappear long ago the peasant get ready for dinner some wash the young lad bathe in the stream other make a place comfortable for a rest untie their sack of bread and uncover the pitcher of ryebeer the old man crumble up some bread in a cup stir it with the handle of a spoon pour water on it from the dipper break up some more bread and have season it with salt he turn to the east to say his prayer " come master taste my sop " say he kneel down before the cup the sop be so good that levin give up the idea of go home he dine with the old man and talk to he about his family affair take the keen interest in they and tell he about his own affair and all the circumstance that could be of interest to the old man he feel much near to he than to his brother and could not help smile at the affection he feel for this man when the old man get up again say his prayer and lie down under a bush put some grass under his head for a pillow levin do the same and in spite of the cling fly that be so persistent in the sunshine and the midge that tickle his hot face and body he fall asleep at once and only wake when the sun have pass to the other side of the bush and reach he the old man have be awake a long while and be sit up whet the scythe of the young lad levin look about he and hardly recognize the place everything be so changed the immense stretch of meadow have be mow and be sparkle with a peculiar fresh brilliance with its line of already sweetsmelle grass in the slant ray of the evening sun and the bush about the river have be cut down and the river itself not visible before now gleam like steel in its bend and the move ascend peasant and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow and the hawk hover over the stripped meadow — all be

meadow which have in the year of serf labor take thirty scythe two day to mow only the corner remain to do where the row be short but levin feel a longing to get as much mowing do that day as possible and be vex with the sun sink so quickly in the sky he feel no weariness all he want be to get his work do more and more quickly and as much do as possible " could you cut mashkin upland too — what do you think " he say to the old man " as god will the sun ’ not high a little vodka for the lad " at the afternoon rest when they be sit down again and those who smoke have light their pipe the old man

tree when they go with their jingle dipper into the wooded ravine of mashkin upland the grass be up to their waist in the middle of the hollow soft tender and feathery spot here and there among the

do not trouble the old man swinge his scythe just as ever and move his foot in their big plaited shoe with firm little step he climb slowly up the steep place and though his breech hang out below his smock and his whole frame tremble with effort he do not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way and keep make joke with the peasant and levin levin walk after he and often think he must fall as he climb with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have be hard work to clamber without anything but he climb up and do what he have to do he feel as though some external force be move he

copper in the washhouse nor even an ironingboard in the maid ' room find instead of peace and rest all these from her point of view fearful calamity darya alexandrovna be at first in despair she exert herself to the utmost feel the hopelessness of the position and be every instant suppress the tear that start into her eye the bailiff a retired quartermaster whom stepan arkadyevitch have take a fancy to and have appoint bailiff on account of his handsome and respectful appearance as a hallporter show no sympathy for darya alexandrovna ’s woe he say respectfully " nothing can be do the peasant be such a wretched lot " and do nothing to help she the position seem hopeless but in the oblonskys ' household as in all family indeed there be one inconspicuous but most valuable and useful person marya philimonovna she soothe her mistress assure she that everything would come round it be her expression and matvey have borrow it from she and without fuss or hurry proceed to set to work herself she have immediately make friend with the bailiff ’s wife and on the very first day she drink tea with she and the bailiff under the acacias and review all the circumstance of the position very soon marya philimonovna have establish her club so to say under the acacias and there it be in this club consist of the bailiff ’s wife the village elder and the countinghouse clerk that the difficulty of existence be gradually smooth away and in a week ’s time everything actually have come round the roof be mend a kitchen maid be find — a crony of the village elder’s — hen be buy the cow

ironingboard they even rig up a bathingshed of straw hurdle lily begin to bathe and darya alexandrovna begin to realize if only in part her expectation if not of a peaceful at least of a comfortable life in the country peaceful with six child darya alexandrovna could not be one would fall ill another might easily become so a third would be without something necessary a fourth would show symptom of a bad disposition and so on rare indeed be the brief period of peace but these care and anxiety be for darya alexandrovna the sole happiness possible have it not be for they she would have be leave alone to brood over her husband who do not love she and besides hard though it be for the mother to bear the dread of illness the illness themselves and the grief of see sign of evil propensity in her child — the child themselves be even now repay she in small joy for her suffering those joy be so small that they pass unnoticed like gold in sand and at bad moment she could see nothing but the pain nothing but sand but there be good moment too when she see nothing but the joy nothing but gold now in the solitude of the country she begin to be more and more frequently aware of those joy often look at they she would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she be mistake that she as a mother be partial to her child all the same she could not help say to herself that she have charming child all six of they in different way but a set of child such as be not often to be meet with and she be happy in they and proud of they towards the end of may when everything have be more or less satisfactorily arrange she receive her husband ’s answer to her complaint of the disorganized state of thing in the country he write beg she forgiveness for not have think of everything before and promise to come down at the first chance this chance do not present itself and till the beginning of june darya alexandrovna stay alone in the country on the sunday in st peter ’s week darya alexandrovna drive to mass for all her child to take the sacrament darya alexandrovna in her intimate philosophical talk with her sister her mother and her friend very often astonish they by the freedom of her view in regard to religion she have a strange religion of transmigration of soul all her own in which she have firm faith trouble herself little about the dogma of the church but in her family she be strict in carry out all that be require by the church — and not merely in order to set an example but with all her heart in it the fact that the child have not be at the sacrament for nearly a year worry she extremely and with the full approval and sympathy of marya philimonovna she decide that this should take place now in the summer for several day before darya alexandrovna be busily deliberate on how to dress all the child frock be make or alter and wash seam and flounce be let out button be sew on and ribbon get ready one dress tanya ’s which the english governess have undertake cost darya alexandrovna much loss of temper the english governess in alter it have make the seam in the wrong place have take up the sleeve too much and altogether spoil the dress it be so narrow on tanya ’s shoulder that it be quite painful to look at she but marya philimonovna have the happy thought of put in gusset and add a little shouldercape the dress be set right but there be nearly a quarrel with the english governess on the morning however all be happily arrange and towards ten o’clock — the time at which they have ask the priest to wait for they for the mass — the child in their new dress with beaming face stand on the step before the carriage wait for their mother to the carriage instead of the restive raven they have harness thank to the representation of marya philimonovna the bailiff ’s horse brownie and darya alexandrovna delay by anxiety over her own attire come out and get in dressed in a white muslin gown darya alexandrovna have do her hair and dress with care and excitement in the old day she have dress for her own sake to look pretty and be admire later on as she get old dress become more and more distasteful to she she see that she be lose her good look but now she begin to feel pleasure and interest in dress again now she do not dress for her own sake not for the sake of her own beauty but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creature she might not spoil the general effect and look at herself for the last time in the lookingglass she be satisfied with herself she look nice not nice as she would have wish to look nice in old day at a ball but nice for the object which she now have in view in the church there be no one but the peasant the servant and their womenfolk but darya alexandrovna see or fancy she see the sensation produce by her child and she the child be not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dress but they be charming in the way they behave aliosha it be true do not stand quite correctly he keep turn round try to look at his little jacket from behind but all the same he be wonderfully sweet tanya behave like a grownup person and look after the little one and the small lily be bewitch in her naïve astonishment at everything and it be difficult not to smile when after take the sacrament she say in english " please some more " on the way home the child feel that something solemn have happen and be very sedate everything go happily at home too but at lunch grisha begin whistle and what be bad be disobedient to the english governess and be forbid to have any tart darya alexandrovna would not have let thing go so far on such a day have she be present but she have to support the english governess ’s authority and she uphold her decision that grisha should have no tart this rather spoil the general good humor grisha cry declare that nikolinka have whistle too and he be not punish and that he be not cry for the tart — he do not care — but at be unjustly treat this be really too tragic and darya alexandrovna make up her mind to persuade the english governess to forgive grisha and she go to speak to she but on the way as she pass the drawingroom she behold a scene fill her heart with such pleasure that the tear come into her eye and she forgive the delinquent herself the culprit be sit at the window in the corner of the drawingroom beside he be stand tanya with a plate on the pretext of want to give some dinner to her doll she have ask the governess ’s permission to take her share of tart to the nursery and have take it instead to her brother while still weep over the injustice of his punishment he be eat the tart and keep say through his sob " eat yourself let ’s eat it together   together " tanya have at first be under the influence of her pity for grisha then of a sense of her noble action and tear be stand in her eye too but she do not refuse and eat her share on catch sight of their mother they be dismayed but look into her face they see they be not do wrong they burst out laugh and with their mouth full of tart they begin wipe their smile lip with their hand and smear their radiant face all over with tear and jam " mercy your new white

difficult too to keep in one ’s head and not mix up all the stocking little breech and shoe for the different leg and to undo and to do up again all the tape and button darya alexandrovna who have

should by right have come from her own husband darya alexandrovna certainly do not like this little way of stepan arkadyevitch ’s of foist his domestic duty on other and she be at once aware that levin be aware of this it be just for this fineness of perception for this delicacy that darya alexandrovna like levin " I know of course " say levin " that that simply mean that you would like to see I and I ’m exceedingly glad though I can fancy that use to town housekeeping as you be you must feel in the wild here and if there ’ anything want I ’m altogether at your disposal " " oh no " say

feeling of shyness and hostility which child so often experience towards hypocritical grownup people and for which they be so often and miserably punish hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the clever and most penetrating man but the least wideawake of child recognize it and be revolt by it however ingeniously it may be disguise whatever fault levin have there be not a trace of hypocrisy in he and so the child show he the same friendliness that they see in their mother ’s face on his invitation the two eld one at once jump out to he and run with he as simply as they would have do with

passionately long to hear more of kitty and at the same time be afraid of hear it he dread the breaking up of the inward peace he have gain with such effort " yes but still all this have to be look after and who be there to look after it " darya alexandrovna respond without interest she have by now get her household matter so satisfactorily arrange thank to marya philimonovna that she be disinclined to make any change in they besides she have no faith in levin ’s knowledge of farming general principle as to the cow be a machine for the production of milk she look on with suspicion it seem to she that such principle could only be a hindrance in farm management it all seem to she a far simple matter all that be need as marya philimonovna have explain be to give brindle and whitebreast more food and drink and not to let the cook you all the kitchen slop to the laundry maid ’s cow that be clear but general proposition as to feed on meal and on grass be doubtful and obscure and what be most important she want to talk about kitty " kitty write to I that there ’ nothing she long for so much as quiet and solitude " dolly say after the silence that have follow " and how be she — well " levin ask in agitation " thank god she ’ quite well again I never believe she lung be affect " " oh I ’m very glad " say levin and dolly fancy she see something touching helpless in his face as he say this and look silently into her face " let I ask you konstantin dmitrievitch " say darya alexandrovna smile her kindly and rather mocking smile " why be it you be angry with

levin and all the tenderness he have be feel for kitty a minute before be replace by a feeling of anger for the slight he have suffer " what make you suppose I know " " because everybody know it " " that ’ just where you be mistaken I do not know it though I have guess it be so " " well now you know it " " all I know be that something have happen that make she dreadfully miserable and that she

bury " if I do not like you " she say and tear come into her eye " if I do not know you as I do know you " the feeling that have seem dead revive more and more rise up and take possession of levin ’s heart " yes I understand it all now " say darya alexandrovna " you can not understand it for you man who be free and make your own choice it ’ always clear whom you love but a girl ’ in a position of suspense with all a woman ’s or maiden ’s modesty a girl who see you man from afar who take everything on trust — a girl may have and often have such a feeling that she can not tell what to say " " yes if the heart do not speak " " no the heart do speak but just consider you man have view about a girl you come to the house you make friend you criticize you wait to see if you have find what you love and then when you be sure you love she you make an offer " " well that ’ not quite it " " anyway you make an offer when your love be ripe or when the balance have completely turn between the two you be choose from but a girl be not ask she be expect to make she choice and yet she can not choose she can only answer ' yes ' or ' no ' " " yes to choose between I and vronsky " think levin and the dead thing that have come to life within he die again and only weigh on his heart and set it ache " darya alexandrovna " he say " that ’ how one choose a new dress or some purchase or other not love the choice have be make and so much the well and there can be no repeat it " " ah pride pride " say darya alexandrovna as though despise he for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only woman know " at the time when you make kitty an offer she be just in a position in which she could not answer she be in doubt doubt between you and vronsky he she be see every day and you she have not see for a long while suppose she have be old   I for instance in her place could have feel no doubt I always dislike he and so it have turn out " levin recall kitty ’s answer she have say " no that can not be " " darya alexandrovna " he say dryly " I appreciate your confidence in I I believe you be make a mistake but whether I be right or wrong that pride you so despise make any thought of katerina alexandrovna out of the question for I — you understand utterly out of the question " " I will only say one thing more you know that I be speak of my sister whom I love as I love my own child I do not say she care for you all I mean to say be that her refusal at that moment prove nothing " " I do not know " say levin jump up " if you only know how you be hurt I it ’ just as if a child of yours be dead and they be to say to you he would have be like this and like that and he might have live and how happy you would have be in he but he ’ dead dead dead " " how absurd you be " say darya alexandrovna look with mournful tenderness at levin ’s excitement " yes I see it all more and more clearly " she go on musingly " so you will not come to see we then when kitty ’ here " " no I shall not come of course I will not avoid meet katerina alexandrovna but as far as I can I will try to save she the annoyance of my presence " " you be very very absurd " repeat darya alexandrovna look with tenderness into his face " very well then let it be as though we have not speak of this what have you come for tanya " she say in french to the little girl who have come in " where ’ my spade mamma " " I speak french and you must too " the little girl try to say it in french but could not remember the french for spade the mother prompt she and then tell she in french where to look for the spade and this make a disagreeable impression on levin everything in darya alexandrovna ’s house and child strike he now as by no means so charming as a little while before " and what do she talk french with the child for " he think " how unnatural and false it be and the child feel it so learn french and unlearn sincerity " he think to himself unaware that darya alexandrovna have think all that over twenty time already and yet even at the cost of some loss of sincerity believe it necessary to teach her child french in that way " but why be you go do stay a little " levin stay to tea but his goodhumor have vanish and he feel ill at ease after tea he go out into the hall to order his horse to be put in and when he come back he find darya alexandrovna greatly disturbed with a troubled face and tear in her eye while levin have be outside an incident have occur which have utterly shatter all the happiness she have be feel that day and her pride in her child grisha and tanya have be fight over a ball darya alexandrovna hear a scream in the nursery run in and see a terrible sight tanya be pull grisha ’s hair while he with a face hideous with rage be beat she with his fist wherever he could get at she something snap in darya alexandrovna ’s heart when she see this it be as if darkness have swoop down upon her life she feel that these child of hers that she be so proud of be not merely most ordinary but positively bad illbred child with coarse brutal propensity — wicked child she could not talk or think of anything else and she could not speak to levin of her misery levin see she be unhappy and try to comfort she say that it show nothing bad that all child fight but even as he say it he be think in his heart " no I will not be artificial and talk french with my child but my child will not be like that all one have to do be not spoil child not to distort their nature and they ’ll be delightful no my child will not be like that " he say goodbye and drive away and she do not try to keep he in the middle of july the elder of the village on levin ’s sister ’s estate about fifteen mile from pokrovskoe come to levin to report on how thing be go there and on the hay the chief source of income on his sister ’s estate be from the riverside meadow in former year the hay have be buy by the peasant for twenty rouble the three acre when levin take over the management of the estate he think on examine the grassland that they be worth more and he fix the price at twentyfive rouble the three acre the peasant would not give that price and as levin suspect keep off other purchaser then levin have drive over himself and arrange to have the grass cut partly by hire labor partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop his own peasant put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement but it be carry out and the first year the meadow have yield a profit almost double the previous year — which be the third year — the peasant have maintain the same opposition to the arrangement and the hay have be cut on the same system this year the peasant be do all the mowing for a third of the hay crop and the village elder have come now to announce that the hay have be cut and that fear rain they have invite the countinghouse clerk over have divide the crop in his presence and have rake together eleven stack as the owner ’s share from the vague answer to his question how much hay have be cut on the principal meadow from the hurry of the village elder who have make the division not ask leave from the whole tone of the peasant levin perceive that there be something wrong in the division of the hay and make up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter arrive for dinner at the village and leave his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his the husband of his brother ’s wetnurse levin go to see the old man in his beehouse want to find out from he the truth about the hay parmenitch a talkative comely old man give levin a very warm welcome show he all he be do tell he everything about his bee and the swarm of that year but give vague and unwilling answer to levin ’s inquiry about the mowing this confirm levin still more in his suspicion he go to the hay field and examine the stack the haystack could not possibly contain fifty wagonload each and to convict the peasant levin order the wagon that have carry the hay to be bring up directly to lift one stack and carry it into the barn there turn out to be only thirtytwo load in the stack in spite of the village elder ’s assertion about the compressibility of hay and its have settle down in the stack and his swearing that everything have be do in the fear of god levin stick to his point that the hay have be divide without his order and that therefore he would not accept that hay as fifty load to a stack after a prolonged dispute the matter be decide by the peasant take these eleven stack reckon they as fifty load each the argument and the division of the haycock last the whole afternoon when the last of the hay have be divide levin intrust the superintendence of the rest to the countinghouse clerk sit down on a haycock mark off by a stake of willow and look admiringly at the meadow swarm with peasant in front of he in the bend of the river beyond the marsh move a brightcolored line of peasant woman and the scatter hay be be rapidly form into gray wind row over the pale green stubble after the woman come the man with pitchfork and from the gray row there be grow up broad high soft haycock to the left cart be rumble over the meadow that have be already clear and one after another the haycock vanish fling up in huge forkful and in their place there be rise heavy cartload of fragrant hay hang over the horse ' hindquarter " what weather for hay what hay it ’ll be " say an old man squat down beside levin " it ’ tea not hay it ’ like scatter grain to the duck the way they pick it up " he add point to the grow haycock " since dinner time they ’ve carry a good half of it " " the last load eh " he shout to a young peasant who drive by stand in the front of an empty cart shake the cord rein " the last dad " the lad shout back pull in the horse and smile he look round at a bright rosychecked peasant girl who sit in the cart smile too and drive on " who ’ that your son " ask levin " my baby " say the old man with a tender smile " what a fine fellow " " the lad ’ all right " " marry already " " yes it ’ two year last st philip ’s day " " any child " " child indeed why for over a year he be innocent as a babe himself and bashful too " answer the old man " well the hay it ’ as fragrant as tea " he repeat wish to change the subject levin look more attentively at ivan parmenov and his wife they be load a haycock onto the cart not far from he ivan parmenov be stand on the cart take lay in place and stamp down the huge bundle of hay which his pretty young wife deftly hand up to he at first in armful and then on the pitchfork the young wife work easily merrily and dexterously the closepacked hay do not once break away off her fork first she gather it together stick the fork into it then with a rapid supple movement lean the whole weight of her body on it and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she draw herself up and arch her full bosom under the white smock with a smart turn swing the fork in her arm and fling the bundle of hay high onto the cart ivan obviously do his good to save she every minute of unnecessary labor make haste open his arm to clutch the bundle and lie it in the cart as she rake together what be leave of the hay the young wife shake off the bit of hay that have fall on her neck and straighten the red kerchief that have drop forward over her white brow not brown like her face by the sun she creep under the cart to tie up the load ivan direct she how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece and at something she say he laugh aloud in the expression of both face be to be see vigorous young freshly awaken love the load be tie on ivan jump down and take the quiet sleek horse by the bridle the young wife fling the rake up on the load and with a bold step swinge her arm she go to join the woman who be form a ring for the haymaker ' dance ivan drive off to the road and fall into line with the other load cart the peasant woman with their rake on their shoulder gay with bright flower and chatter with ring merry voice walk behind the hay cart one wild untrained female voice break into a song and sing it alone through a verse and then the same verse be take up and repeat by half a hundred strong healthy voice of all sort coarse and fine singe in unison the woman all singe begin to come close to levin and he feel as though a storm be swoop down upon he with a thunder of merriment the storm swoop down envelop he and the haycock on which he be lie and the other haycock and the wagonload and the whole meadow and distant field all seem to be shake and singe to the measure of this wild merry song with its shout and whistle and clapping levin feel envious of this health and mirthfulness he long to take part in the expression of this joy of life but he could do nothing and have to lie and look on and listen when the peasant with their singing have vanish out of sight and hear a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation his physical inactivity his alienation from this world come over levin some of the very peasant who have be most active in wrangle with he over the hay some whom he have treat with contumely and who have try to cheat he those very peasant have greet he goodhumoredly and evidently have not be incapable of have any feeling of rancor against he any regret any recollection even of have try to deceive he all that be drown in a sea of merry common labor god give the day god give the strength and the day and the strength be consecrate to labor and that labor be its own reward for whom the labor what would be its fruit these be idle consideration — beside the point often levin have admire this life often he have a sense of envy of the man who lead this life but today for the first time especially under the influence of what he have see in the attitude of ivan parmenov to his young wife the idea present itself definitely to his mind that it be in his power to exchange the dreary artificial idle and individualistic life he be lead for this laborious pure and socially delightful life the old man who have be sit beside he have long ago go home the people have all separate those who live near have go home while those who come from far be gather into a group for supper and to spend the night in the meadow levin unobserved by the peasant still lie on the haycock and still look on and listen and muse the peasant who remain for the night in the meadow scarcely sleep all the short summer night at first there be the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper then singing again and laughter all the long day of toil have leave no trace in they but lightness of heart before the early dawn all be hush nothing be to be hear but the night sound of the frog that never cease in the marsh and the horse snort in the mist that rise over the meadow before the morning rouse himself levin get up from the haycock and look at the star he see that the night be over " well what be I go to do how be I to set about it " he say to himself try to express to himself all the thought and feeling he have pass through in that brief night all the thought and feeling he have pass through fall into three separate train of thought one be the renunciation of his old life of his utterly useless education this renunciation give he satisfaction and be easy and simple another series of thought and mental image relate to the life he long to live now the simplicity the purity the sanity of this life he feel clearly and he be convinced he would find in it the content the peace and the dignity of the lack of which he be so miserably conscious but a third series of idea turn upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new and there nothing take clear shape for he " have a wife have work and the necessity of work leave pokrovskoe buy land become a member of a peasant community marry a peasant girl how be I to set about it " he ask himself again and could not find an answer " I have not sleep all night though and I can not think it out clearly " he say to himself " I ’ll work it out later one thing ’ certain this night have decide my fate all my old dream of home life be absurd not the real thing " he tell himself " it ’ all ever so much simple and well " " how beautiful " he think look at the strange as it be motherofpearl shell of white fleecy cloudlet rest right over his head in the middle of the sky " how exquisite it all be in this exquisite night and when be there time for that cloudshell to form just now I look at the sky and there be nothing in it — only two white streak yes and so imperceptibly too my view of life change " he go out of the meadow and walk along the highroad towards the village a slight wind arise and the sky look gray and sullen the gloomy moment have come that usually precede the dawn the full triumph of light over darkness shrink from the cold levin walk rapidly look at the ground " what ’ that someone come " he think catch the tinkle of bell and lift his head forty pace from he a carriage with four horse harness abreast be drive towards he along the grassy road on which he be walk the shafthorse be tilt against the shaft by the rut but the dexterous driver sit on the box hold the shaft over the rut so that the wheel run on the smooth part of the road this be all levin notice and without wonder who it could be he gaze absently at the coach in the coach be an old lady doze in one corner and at the window evidently only just awake sit a young girl hold in both hand the ribbon of a white cap with a face full of light and think full of a subtle complex inner life that be remote from levin she be gaze beyond he at the glow of the sunrise at the very instant when this apparition be vanish the truthful eye glance at he she recognize he and her face light up with wonder delight he could not be mistake there be no other eye like those in the world there be only one creature in the world that could concentrate for he all the brightness and meaning of life it be she it be kitty he understand that she be drive to ergushovo from the railway station and everything that have be stir levin during that sleepless night all the resolution he have make all vanish at once he recall with horror his dream of marry a peasant girl there only in the carriage that have cross over to the other side of the road and be rapidly disappear there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life which have weigh so agonizingly upon he of late she do not look out again the sound of the carriagespring be no long audible the bell could scarcely be hear the barking of dog show the carriage have reach the village and all that be leave be the empty field all round the village in front and he himself isolated and apart from it all wander lonely along the deserted highroad he glance at the sky expect to find there the cloud shell he have be admire and take as the symbol of the idea and feeling of that night there be nothing in the sky in the least like a shell there in the remote height above a mysterious change have be accomplish there be no trace of shell and there be stretch over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tiny cloudlet the sky have grow blue and bright and with the same softness but with the same remoteness it meet his question gaze " no " he say to himself " however good that life of simplicity and toil may be I can not go back to it I love she " none but those who be most intimate with alexey alexandrovitch know that while on the surface the cold and most reasonable of man he have one weakness quite oppose to the general trend of his character alexey alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman cry without be move the sight of tear throw he into a state of nervous agitation and he utterly lose all power of reflection the chief secretary of his department and his private secretary be aware of this and use to warn woman who come with petition on no account to give way to tear if they do not want to ruin their chance " he will get angry and will not listen to you " they use to say and as a fact in such case the emotional disturbance set up in alexey alexandrovitch by the sight of tear find expression in hasty anger " I can do nothing kindly leave the room " he would commonly cry in such case when return from the race anna have inform he of her relation with vronsky and immediately afterwards have burst into tear hide her face in her hand alexey alexandrovitch for all the fury arouse in he against she be aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produce in he by tear conscious of it and conscious that any expression of his feeling at that minute would be out of keeping with the position he try to suppress every manifestation of life in himself and so neither stir nor look at she this be what have cause that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which have so impress anna when they reach the house he help she to get out of the carriage and make an effort to master himself take leave of she with his usual urbanity and utter that phrase that bind he to nothing he say that tomorrow he would let she know his decision his wife ’s word confirm his bad suspicion have send a cruel pang to the heart of alexey alexandrovitch that pang be intensify by the strange feeling of physical pity for she set up by her tear but when he be all alone in the carriage alexey alexandrovitch to his surprise and delight feel complete relief both from this pity and from the doubt and agony of jealousy he experience the sensation of a man who have have a tooth out after suffer long from toothache after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge big than the head itself be tear out of his jaw the sufferer hardly able to believe in his own good luck feel all at once that what have so long poison his existence and enchain his attention exist no long and that he can live and think again and take interest in other thing besides his tooth this feeling alexey alexandrovitch be experience the agony have be strange and terrible but now it be over he feel that he could live again and think of something other than his wife " no honor no heart no religion a corrupt woman I always know it and always see it though I try to deceive myself to spare she " he say to himself and it actually seem to he that he always have see it he recall incident of their past life in which he have never see anything wrong before — now these incident prove clearly that she have always be a corrupt woman " I make a mistake in link my life to hers but there be nothing wrong in my mistake and so I can not be unhappy it ’ not I that be to blame " he tell himself " but she but I have nothing to do with she she do not exist for I " everything relate to she and her son towards whom his sentiment be as much change as towards she cease to interest he the only thing that interest he now be the question of in what way he could well with most propriety and comfort for himself and thus with most justice extricate himself from the mud with which she have spatter he in her fall and then proceed along his path of active honorable and useful existence " I can not be make unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman have commit a crime I have only to find the good way out of the difficult position in which she have place I and I shall find it " he say to himself frown more and more " I ’m not the first nor the last " and to say nothing of historical instance date from the " fair helen " of menelaus recently revive in the memory of all a whole list of contemporary example of husband with unfaithful wife in the high society rise before alexey alexandrovitch ’s imagination " daryalov poltavsky prince karibanov count paskudin dram yes even dram such an honest capable fellow   semyonov tchagin sigonin " alexey alexandrovitch remember " admit that a certain quite irrational ridicule fall to the lot of these man yet I never see anything but a misfortune in it and always feel sympathy for it " alexey alexandrovitch say to himself though indeed this be not the fact and he have never feel sympathy for misfortune of that kind but the more frequently he have hear of instance of unfaithful wife betray their husband the more highly he have think of himself " it be a misfortune which may befall anyone and this misfortune have befall I the only thing to be do be to make the good of the position " and he begin pass in review the method of proceeding of man who have be in the same position that he be in " daryalov fight a duel " the duel have particularly fascinate the thought of alexey alexandrovitch in his youth just because he be physically a coward and be himself well aware of the fact alexey alexandrovitch could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aim at himself and have never make use of any weapon in his life this horror have in his youth set he ponder on duel and picture himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger have attain success and an establish position in the world he have long ago forget this feeling but the habitual bent of feeling reassert itself and dread of his own cowardice prove even now so strong that alexey alexandrovitch spend a long while think over the question of dueling in all its aspect and hug the idea of a duel though he be fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstance fight one " there ’ no doubt our society be still so barbarous it ’ not the same in england that very many”—and among these be those whose opinion alexey alexandrovitch particularly valued—“look favorably on the duel but what result be attain by it suppose I call he out " alexey alexandrovitch go on to himself and vividly picture the night he would spend after the challenge and the pistol aim at he he shudder and know that he never would do it—“suppose I call he out suppose I be teach " he go on muse " to shoot I press the trigger " he say to himself close his eye " and it turn out I have kill he " alexey alexandrovitch say to himself and he shake his head as though to dispel such silly idea " what sense be there in murder a man in order to define one ’s relation to a guilty wife and son I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with she but what be more probable and what would doubtless occur — I should be kill or wound I the innocent person should be the victim — kill or wound it ’ even more senseless but apart from that a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side do not I know perfectly well that my friend would never allow I to fight a duel — would never allow the life of a statesman need by russia to be expose to danger know perfectly well beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my simply try to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge that would be dishonest that would be false that would be deceive myself and other a duel be quite irrational and no one expect it of I my aim be simply to safeguard my reputation which be essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duty " official duty which have always be of great consequence in alexey alexandrovitch ’s eye seem of special importance to his mind at this moment consider and reject the duel alexey alexandrovitch turn to divorce — another solution select by several of the husband he remember pass in mental review all the instance he know of divorce there be plenty of they in the very high society with which he be very familiar alexey alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce be that which he have in view in all these instance the husband have practically cede or sell his unfaithful wife and the very party which be in fault have not the right to contract a fresh marriage have form counterfeit pseudomatrimonial tie with a selfstyled husband in his own case alexey alexandrovitch see that a legal divorce that be to say one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiate be impossible of attainment he see that the complex condition of the life they lead make the coarse proof of his wife ’s guilt require by the law out of the question he see that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proof be bring forward even if he have they and that to bring forward such proof would damage he in the public estimation more than it would she an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal which would be a perfect godsend to his enemy for calumny and attack on his high position in society his chief object to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible would not be attain by divorce either moreover in the event of divorce or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce it be obvious that the wife break off all relation with the husband and throw in her lot with the lover and in spite of the complete as he suppose contempt and indifference he now feel for his wife at the bottom of his heart alexey alexandrovitch still have one feeling leave in regard to she — a disinclination to see she free to throw in her lot with vronsky so that her crime would be to her advantage the mere notion of this so exasperate alexey alexandrovitch that directly it rise to his mind he groan with inward agony and get up and change his place in the carriage and for a long while after he sit with scowling brow wrap his numbed and bony leg in the fleecy rug " apart from formal divorce one might still do like karibanov paskudin and that good fellow dram — that be separate from one ’s wife " he go on think when he have regain his composure but this step too present the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce and what be more a separation quite as much as a regular divorce fling his wife into the arm of vronsky " no it ’ out of the question out of the question " he say again twist his rug about he again " I can not be unhappy but neither she nor he ought to be happy " the feeling of jealousy which have torture he during the period of uncertainty have pass away at the instant when the tooth have be with agony extract by his wife ’s word but that feeling have be replace by another the desire not merely that she should not be triumphant but that she should get due punishment for her crime he do not acknowledge this feeling but at the bottom of his heart he long for she to suffer for have destroy his peace of mind — his honor and go once again over the condition inseparable from a duel a divorce a separation and once again reject they alexey alexandrovitch feel convinced that there be only one solution — to keep she with he conceal what have happen from the world and use every measure in his power to break off the intrigue and still more — though this he do not admit to himself — to punish she " I must inform she of my conclusion that think over the terrible position in which she have place her you all other solution will be bad for both side than an external status quo and that such I agree to retain on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wish that be to say cessation of all intercourse with her lover " when this decision have be finally adopt another weighty consideration occur to alexey alexandrovitch in support of it

difficult as the task will be to I I shall devote part of my energy to her reformation and salvation " though alexey alexandrovitch be perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity though in pass through these difficult moment he have not once think of seek guidance in religion yet now when his conclusion correspond as it seem to he with the requirement of religion this religious sanction to his decision give he complete satisfaction and to some extent restore his peace of mind he be pleased to think that even in such an important crisis in life no one would be able to say that he have not act in accordance with the principle of that religion whose banner he have always hold aloft amid the general coolness and indifference as he ponder over subsequent development alexey alexandrovitch do not see indeed why his relation with his wife should not remain practically the same as before no doubt she could never regain his esteem but there be not and there could not be any sort of reason that his existence should be trouble and that he should suffer because she be a bad and faithless wife " yes time will pass time which arrange all thing and the old relation will be reestablish " alexey alexandrovitch tell himself " so far reestablish that be that I shall not be sensible of a

preparation shall be make for your arrival here I beg you to note that I attach particular significance to compliance with this request a karenin " ps — I enclose the money which may be need for your expense " he read the letter through and feel pleased with it and especially that he have remember to enclose money there be not a harsh word not a reproach in it nor be there undue indulgence most of all it be a golden bridge for return fold the letter and smooth it with a massive ivory knife and put it in an envelope with the money he ring the bell with the gratification it always afford he to use the well arrange appointment of his writingtable " give this to the courier to be deliver to anna arkadyevna tomorrow at the summer villa " he say get up " certainly your excellency tea to be

french work on egyptian hieroglyphic that he have begin over the easy chair there hang in a gold frame an oval portrait of anna a fine painting by a celebrated artist alexey alexandrovitch glance at it the unfathomable eye gaze ironically and insolently at he insufferably insolent and challenging be the effect in alexey alexandrovitch ’s eye of the black lace about the head admirably touch in by the painter the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lift cover with ring after look at the portrait for a minute alexey alexandrovitch shudder so that his lip quiver and he utter the sound " brrr " and turn away he make haste to sit down in his easy chair and open the book he try to read but he could not revive the very vivid interest he have feel before in egyptian hieroglyphic he look at the book and think of something else he think not of his wife but of a complication that have arise in his official life which at the time constitute the chief interest of it he feel that he have penetrate more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair and that he have originate a leading idea — he could say it without selfflattery — calculate to clear up the whole business to strengthen he in his official career to discomfit his enemy and thereby to be of the great benefit to the government directly the servant have set the tea and leave the room alexey alexandrovitch get up and go to the writingtable move into the middle of the table a portfolio of paper with a scarcely perceptible smile of selfsatisfaction he take a pencil from a rack and plunge into the perusal of a complex report relate to the present complication the complication be of this nature alexey alexandrovitch ’s characteristic quality as a politician that special individual qualification that every rise functionary possess the qualification that with his unflagging ambition his reserve his honesty and with his selfconfidence have make his career be his contempt for red tape his cutting down of correspondence his direct contact wherever possible with the live fact and his economy it happen that the famous commission of the 2nd of june have set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of land in the zaraisky province which fall under alexey alexandrovitch ’s department and be a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reform alexey alexandrovitch be aware of the truth of this the irrigation of these land in the zaraisky province have be initiate by the predecessor of alexey alexandrovitch ’s predecessor and vast sum of money have actually be spend and be still be spend on this business and utterly unproductively and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever alexey alexandrovitch have perceive this at once on enter office and would have like to lay hand on the board of irrigation but at first when he do not yet feel secure in his position he know it would affect too many interest and would be injudicious later on he have be engross in other question and have simply forget the board of irrigation it go of itself like all such board by the mere force of inertia many people gain their livelihood by the board of irrigation especially one highly conscientious and musical you all the daughter play on stringed instrument and alexey alexandrovitch know the family and have stand godfather to one of the eld daughter the raising of this question by a hostile department be in alexey alexandrovitch ’s opinion a dishonorable proceeding see that in every department there be thing similar and bad which no one inquire into for wellknown reason of official etiquette however now that the glove have be throw down to he he have boldly pick it up and demand the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the board of irrigation of the land in the zaraisky province but in compensation he give no quarter to the enemy either he demand the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the native tribes organization committee the question of the native tribe have be bring up incidentally in the commission of the 2nd of june and have be press forward actively by alexey alexandrovitch as one admit of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribe in the commission this question have be a ground of contention between several department the department hostile to alexey alexandrovitch prove that the condition of the native tribe be exceedingly flourish that the propose reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity and that if there be anything wrong it arise mainly from the failure on the part of alexey alexandrovitch ’s department to carry out the measure prescribe by law now alexey alexandrovitch intend to demand first that a new commission should be form which should be empower to investigate the condition of the native tribe on the spot secondly if it should appear that the condition of the native tribe actually be such as it appear to be from the official document in the hand of the committee that another new scientific commission should be appoint to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribe from the—1 political 2 administrative 3 economic 4 ethnographical 5 material and 6 religious point of view thirdly that evidence should be require from the rival department of the measure that have be take during the last ten year by that department for avert the disastrous condition in which the native tribe be now place and fourthly and finally that that department explain why it have as appear from the evidence before the committee from no 17015 and 18038 from december 5 1863 and june 7 1864 act in direct contravention of the intent of the law t act 18 and the note to act 36 a flash of eagerness suffuse the face of alexey alexandrovitch as he rapidly write out a synopsis of these idea for his own benefit have fill a sheet of paper he get up ring and send a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain necessary fact for he get up and walk about the room he glance again at the portrait frown and smile contemptuously after read a little more of the book on egyptian hieroglyphic and renew his interest in it alexey alexandrovitch go to bed at eleven o’clock and recollect as he lie in bed the incident with his wife he see it now in by no mean such a gloomy light though anna have obstinately and with exasperation contradict vronsky when he tell she their position be impossible at the bottom of her heart she regard her own position as false and dishonorable and she long with her whole soul to change it on the way home from the race she have tell her husband the truth in a moment of excitement and in spite of the agony she have suffer in do so she be glad of it after her husband have leave she she tell herself that she be glad that now everything be make clear and at least there would be no more lying and deception it seem to she beyond doubt that her position be now make clear forever it might be bad this new position but it would be clear there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it the pain she have cause herself and her husband in utter those word would be reward now by everything be make clear she think that evening she see vronsky but she do not tell he of what have pass between she and her husband though to make the position definite it be necessary to tell he when she wake up next morning the first thing that rise to her mind be what she have say to her husband and those word seem to she so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have bring herself to utter those strange coarse word and could not imagine what would come of it but the word be speak and alexey alexandrovitch have go away without say anything " I see vronsky and do not tell he at the very instant he be go away I would have turn he back and tell he but I change my mind because it be strange that I have not tell he the first minute why be it I want to tell he and do not tell he " and in answer to this question a burn blush of shame spread over her face she know what have keep she from it she know that she have be ashamed her position which have seem to she simplify the night before suddenly strike she now as not only not simple but as absolutely hopeless she feel terrified at the disgrace of which she have not ever think before directly she think of what her husband would do the most terrible idea come to her mind she have a vision of be turn out of the house of her shame be proclaim to all the world she ask herself where she should go when she be turn out of the house and she could not find an answer when she think of vronsky it seem to she that he do not love she that he be already begin to be tired of she that she could not offer herself to he and she feel bitter against he for it it seem to she that the word that she have speak to her husband and have continually repeat in her imagination she have say to everyone and everyone have hear they she could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face she could not bring herself to call her maid and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess the maid who have be listen at her door for a long while come into her room of her own accord anna glance inquiringly into her face and blush with a scared look the maid beg her pardon for come in say that she have fancy the bell ring she bring her clothe and a note the note be from betsy betsy remind she that liza merkalova and baroness shtoltz be come to play croquet with she that morning with their adorer kaluzhsky and old stremov " come if only as a study in moral I shall expect you " she finish anna read the note and heave a deep sigh " nothing I need nothing " she say to annushka who be rearrange the bottle and brush on the dressing table " you can go I ’ll dress at once and come down I need nothing " annushka go out but anna do not begin dress and sit in the same position her head and hand hang listlessly and every now and then she shiver all over seem as though she would make some gesture utter some word and sink back into lifelessness again she repeat continually " my god my god " but neither " god " nor " my " have any meaning to she the idea of seek help in her difficulty in religion be as remote from she as seek help from alexey alexandrovitch himself although she have never have doubt of the faith in which she have be bring up she know that the support of religion be possible only upon condition of renounce what make up for she the whole meaning of life she be not simply miserable she begin to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition never experience before in which she find herself she feel as though everything be begin to be double in her soul just as object sometimes appear double to overtire eye she hardly know at time what it be she fear and what she hope for whether she fear or desire what have happen or what be go to happen and exactly what she long for she could not have say " ah what be I do " she say to herself feel a sudden thrill of pain in both side of her head when she come to herself she see that she be hold her hair in both hand each side of her temple and pull it she jump up and begin walk about " the coffee be ready and mademoiselle and seryozha be wait " say annushka come back again and find anna in the same position " seryozha what about seryozha " anna ask with sudden eagerness recollect her son ’s existence for the first time that morning " he ’ be naughty I think " answer annushka with a smile " in what way " " some peach be lie on the table in the corner room I think he slip in and eat one of they on the sly " the recollection of her son suddenly rouse anna from the helpless condition in which she find herself she recall the partly sincere though greatly exaggerated rôle of the mother live for her child which she have take up of late year and she feel with joy that in the plight in which she find herself she have a support quite apart from her relation to her husband or to vronsky this support be her son in whatever position she might be place she could not lose her son her husband might put she to shame and turn she out vronsky might grow cold to she and go on live his own life apart she think of he again with bitterness and reproach she could not leave her son she have an aim in life and she must act act to secure this relation to her son so that he might not be take from she quickly indeed as quickly as possible she must take action before he be take from she she must take her son and go away here be the one thing she have to do now she need consolation she must be calm and get out of this insufferable position the thought of immediate action bind she to her son of go away somewhere with he give she this consolation she dress quickly go downstairs and with resolute step walk into the drawingroom where she find as usual wait for she the coffee seryozha and his governess you all in white with his back and head bent be stand at a table under a lookingglass and with an expression of intense concentration which she know well and in which he resemble his father he be do something to the flower he carry the governess have a particularly severe expression seryozha scream shrilly as he often do " ah mamma " and stop hesitate whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flower or to finish make the wreath and go with the flower the governess after say goodmorning begin a long and detailed account of seryozha ’s naughtiness but anna do not hear she she be consider whether she would take she with she or not " no I will not take she " she decide " I ’ll go alone with my child " " yes it ’ very wrong " say anna and take her son by the shoulder she look at he not severely but with a timid glance that bewilder and delight the boy and she kiss he " leave he to I " she say to the astonished governess and not let go of her son she sit down at the table where coffee be set ready for she " mamma I   I   do not " he say try to make out from her expression what be in store for he in regard to the peach " seryozha " she say as soon as the governess have leave the room " that be wrong but you ’ll never do it again will you you love I " she feel that the tear be come into her eye " can I help love he " she say to herself look deeply into his scared and at the same time delighted eye " and can he ever join his father in punish I be it possible he will not feel for I " tear be already flow down her face and to hide they she get up abruptly and almost run out on to the terrace after the thunder shower of the last few day cold bright weather have set in the air be cold in the bright sun that filter through the freshly wash leave she shiver both from the cold and from the inward horror which have clutch she with fresh force in the open air " run along run along to mariette " she say to seryozha who have follow she out and she begin walk up and down on the straw matting of the terrace " can it be that they will not forgive I will not understand how it all could not be help " she say to herself stand still and look at the top of the aspen tree wave in the wind with their freshly wash brightly shine leave in the cold sunshine she know that they would not forgive she that everyone and everything would be merciless to she now as be that sky that green and again she feel that everything be split in two in her soul " I must not must not think " she say to herself " I must get ready to go where when whom to take with I yes to moscow by the evening train annushka and seryozha and only the most necessary thing but first I must write to they both " she go quickly indoors into her boudoir sit down at the table and write to her husband—“after what have happen I can not remain any long in your house I be go away and take my son with I I do not know the law and so I do not know with which of the parent the son should remain but I take he with I because I can not live without he be generous leave he to I " up to this point she write rapidly and naturally but the appeal to his generosity a quality she do not recognize in he and the necessity of wind up the letter with something touching pull she up " of my fault and my remorse I can not speak because " she stop again find no connection in her idea " no " she say to herself " there ’ no need of anything " and tear up the letter she write it again leave out the allusion to generosity and seal it up another letter have to be write to vronsky " I have tell my husband " she write and she sit a long while unable to write more it be so coarse so unfeminine " and what more be I to write to he " she say to herself again a flush of shame spread over her face she recall his composure and a feeling of anger against he impel she to tear the sheet with the phrase she have write into tiny bit " no need of anything " she say to herself and close her blottingcase she go upstairs tell the governess and the servant that she be go that day to moscow and at once set to work to pack up her thing all the room of the summer villa be full of porter gardener and footman go to and fro carry out thing cupboard and chest be open twice they have send to the shop for cord piece of newspaper be toss about on the floor two trunk some bag and strappedup rug have be carry down into the hall the carriage and two hire cab be wait at the step anna forget her inward agitation in the work of packing be stand at a table in her boudoir pack her traveling bag when annushka call her attention to the rattle of some carriage drive up anna look out of the window and see alexey alexandrovitch ’s courier on the step ring at the front door bell " run and find out what it be " she say and with a calm sense of be prepare for anything she sit down in a low chair fold her hand on her knee a footman bring in a thick packet direct in alexey alexandrovitch ’s hand " the courier have order to wait for an answer " he say " very well " she say and as soon as he have leave the room she tear open the letter with trembling finger a roll of unfold note do up in a wrapper fall out of it she disengage the letter and begin read it at the end " preparation shall be make for your arrival here   I attach particular significance to compliance " she read she run on then back read it all through and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning when she have finish she feel that she be cold all over and that a fearful calamity such as she have not expect have burst upon she in the morning she have regret that she have speak to her husband and wish for nothing so much as that those word could be unspoken and here this letter regard they as unspoken and give she what she have want but now this letter seem to she more awful than anything she have be able to conceive " he ’ right " she say " of course he ’ always right he ’ a christian he ’ generous yes vile base creature and no one understand it except I and no one ever will and I can not explain it they say he ’ so religious so highprincipled so upright so clever but they do not see what I ’ve see they do not know how he have crush my life for eight year crush everything that be live in I — he have not once even think that I ’m a live woman who must have love they do not know how at every step he ’ humiliate I and be just as pleased with himself have not I strive strive with all my strength to find something to give meaning to my life have not I struggle to love he to love my son when I could not love my husband but the time come when I know that I could not cheat myself any long that I be alive that I be not to blame that god have make I so that I must love and live and now what do he do if he ’d kill I if he ’d kill he I could have bear anything I could have forgive anything but no he how be it I do not guess what he would do he ’ do just what ’ characteristic of his mean character he ’ll keep himself in the right while I in my ruin he ’ll drive still lower to bad ruin yet " she recall the word from the letter " you can conjecture what await you and your son " " that ’ a threat to take away my child and most likely by their stupid law he can but I know very well why he say it he do not believe even in my love for my child or he despise it just as he always use to ridicule it he despise that feeling in I but he know that I will not abandon my child that I can not abandon my child that there could be no life for I without my child even with he whom I love but that if I abandon my child and run away from he I should be act like the most infamous base of woman he know that and know that I be incapable of do that " she recall another sentence in the letter " our life must go on as it have do in the past " " that life be miserable enough in the old day it have be awful of late what will it be now and he know all that he know that I can not repent that I breathe that I love he know that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit but he want to go on torture I I know he I know that he ’ at home and be happy in deceit like a fish swim in the water no I will not give he that happiness I ’ll break through the spiderweb of lie in which he want to catch I come what may anything ’ well than lying and deceit " " but how my god my god be ever a woman so miserable as I be " " no I will break through it I will break through it " she cry jump up and keep back her tear and she go to the writingtable to write he another letter but at the bottom of her heart she feel that she be not strong enough to break through anything that she be not strong enough to get out of her old position however false and dishonorable it might be she sit down at the writingtable but instead of write she clasp her hand on the table and lay her head on they burst into tear with sob and heave breast like a child cry she be weep that her dream of her position be make clear and definite have be annihilate forever she know beforehand that everything would go on in the old way and far worse indeed than in the old way she feel that the position in the world that she enjoy and that have seem to she of so little consequence in the morning that this position be precious to she that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who have abandon husband and child to join her lover that however much she might struggle she could not be strong than herself she would never know freedom in love but would remain forever a guilty wife with the menace of detection hang over she at every instant deceive her husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man live apart and away from she whose life she could never share she know that this be how it would be and at the same time it be so awful that she could not even conceive what it would end in and she cry without restraint as child cry when they be punish the sound of the footman ’s step force she to rouse herself and hide her face from he she pretend to be write " the courier ask if there ’ an answer " the footman announce " an answer yes " say anna " let he wait I ’ll ring " " what can I write " she think " what can I decide upon alone what do I know what do I want what be there I care for " again she feel that her soul be begin to be split in two she be terrified again at this feeling and clutch at the first pretext for do something which might divert her thought from herself " I ought to see alexey " so she call vronsky in her thought " no one but he can tell I what I ought to do I ’ll go to betsy ’s perhaps I shall see he there " she say to herself completely forget that when she have tell he the day before that she be not go to princess tverskaya ’s he have say that in that case he should not go either she go up to the table write to her husband " I have receive your letter — a " and ring the bell give it to the footman " we be not go " she say to annushka as she come in " not go at all " " no do not unpack till tomorrow and let the carriage wait I ’m go to the princess ’s " " which dress be I to get ready " the croquet party to which the princess tverskaya have invite anna be to consist of two lady and their adorer these two lady be the chief representative of a select new petersburg circle nickname in imitation of some imitation les sept merveilles du monde these lady belong to a circle which though of the high society be utterly hostile to that in which anna move moreover stremov one of the most influential people in petersburg and the elderly admirer of liza merkalova be alexey alexandrovitch ’s enemy in the political world from all these consideration anna have not mean to go and the hint in princess tverskaya ’s note refer to her refusal but now anna be eager to go in the hope of see vronsky anna arrive at princess tverskaya ’s early than the other guest at the same moment as she enter vronsky ’s footman with sidewhisker comb out like a kammerjunker go in too he stop at the door and take off his cap let she pass anna recognize he and only then recall that vronsky have tell she the day before that he would not come most likely he be send a note to say so as she take off her outer garment in the hall she hear the footman pronounce his " r ’ " even like a kammerjunker say " from the count for the princess " and hand the note she long to question he as to where his master be she long to turn back and send he a letter to come and see she or to go herself to see he but neither the first nor the second nor the third course be possible already she hear bell ring to announce her arrival ahead of she and princess tverskaya ’s footman be stand at the open door wait for she to go forward into the inner room " the princess be in the garden they will inform she immediately would you be pleased to walk into the garden " announce another footman in another room the position of uncertainty of indecision be still the same as at home — bad in fact since it be impossible to take any step impossible to see vronsky and she have to remain here among outsider in company so uncongenial to her present mood but she be wear a dress that she know suit she she be not alone all around be that luxurious setting of idleness that she be use to and she feel less wretched than at home she be not force to think what she be to do everything would be do of itself on meet betsy come towards she in a white gown that strike she by its elegance anna smile at she just as she always do princess tverskaya be walk with tushkevitch and a young lady a relation who to the great joy of her parent in the province be spend the summer with the fashionable princess there be probably something unusual about anna for betsy notice it at once " I sleep badly " answer anna look intently at the footman who come to meet they and as she suppose bring vronsky ’s note " how glad I be you ’ve come " say betsy " I ’m tired and be just long to have some tea before they come you might go”—she turn to tushkevitch—“with masha and try the croquet ground over there where they ’ve be cut it we shall have time to talk a little over tea we ’ll have a cozy chat eh " she say in english to anna with a smile press the hand with which she hold a parasol " yes especially as I can not stay very long with you I ’m force to go on to old madame vrede I ’ve be promise to go for a century " say anna to whom lie alien as it be to her nature have become not merely simple and natural in society but a positive source of satisfaction why she say this which she have not think of a second before she could not have explain she have say it simply from the reflection that as vronsky would not be here she have well secure her own freedom and try to see he somehow but why she have speak of old madame vrede whom she have to go and see as she have to see many other people she could not have explain and yet as it afterwards turn out have she contrive the most cunning device to meet vronsky she could have think of nothing well " no I ’m not go to let you go for anything " answer betsy look intently into anna ’s face " really if I be not fond of you I should feel offended one would think you be afraid my society would compromise you tea in the little diningroom please " she say half close her eye as she always do when address the footman take the note from he she read it " alexey ’ play we false " she say in french " he write that he can not come " she add in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that vronsky could mean anything more to anna than a game of croquet anna know that betsy know everything but hear how she speak of vronsky before she she almost feel persuaded for a minute that she know nothing " ah " say anna indifferently as though not greatly interested in the matter and she go on smile " how can you or your friend compromise anyone " this playing with word this hiding of a secret have a great fascination for anna as indeed it have for all woman and it be not the necessity of concealment not the aim with which the concealment be contrive but the process of concealment itself which attract her " I can not be more catholic than the pope " she say " stremov and liza merkalova why they ’re the cream of the cream of society besides they ’re receive everywhere and i”—she lay special stress on the i—“have never be strict and intolerant it ’ simply that I have not the time " " no you do not care perhaps to meet stremov let he and alexey alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee — that ’ no affair of ours but in the world he ’ the most amiable man I know and a devoted croquet player you shall see and in spite of his absurd position as liza ’s lovesick swain at his age you ought to see how he carry off the absurd position he ’ very nice sappho shtoltz you do not know oh that ’ a new type quite new " betsy say all this and at the same time from her goodhumored shrewd glance anna feel that she partly guess her plight and be hatch something for her benefit they be in the little boudoir " I must write to alexey though " and betsy sit down to the table scribble a few line and put the note in an envelope " I ’m tell he to come to dinner I ’ve one lady extra to dinner with I and no man to take she in look what I ’ve say will that persuade he excuse I I must leave you for a minute would you seal it up please and send it off " she say from the door " I have to give some direction " without a moment ’s thought anna sit down to the table with betsy ’s letter and without read it write below " it ’ essential for I to see you come to the vrede garden I shall be there at six o’clock " she seal it up and betsy come back in her presence hand the note to be take at tea which be bring they on a little teatable in the cool little drawingroom the cozy chat promise by princess tverskaya before the arrival of her visitor really do come off between the two woman they criticize the people they be expect and the conversation fall upon liza merkalova " she ’ very sweet and I always like she " say anna " you ought to like she she rave about you yesterday she come up to I after the race and be in despair at not find you she say you ’re a real heroine of romance and that if she be a man she would do all sort of mad thing for your sake stremov say she do that as it be " " but do tell I please I never could make it out " say anna after be silent for some time speak in a tone that show she be not ask an idle question but that what she be ask

that ’ the question of an enfant terrible " and betsy obviously try to restrain herself but could not and go off into peal of that infectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often " you ’d well ask they " she bring out between tear of laughter " no you laugh " say anna laugh too in spite of herself " but I never could understand it I can not understand the husband ’s rôle in it " " the husband liza merkalova ’s husband carry her shawl and be always ready to be of use but anything more than that in reality no one care to inquire you know in decent society one do not talk or think even of certain detail of the toilet that ’ how it be with this " " will you be at madame rolandak ’s fête " ask anna to change the conversation " I do not think so " answer betsy and without look at her friend she begin fill the little transparent cup with fragrant tea put a cup before anna she take out a cigarette and fit it into a silver holder she light it " it ’ like this you see I ’m in a fortunate position " she begin quite serious now as she take up her cup " I understand you and I understand liza liza now be one of those naïve nature that like child do not know what ’ good and what ’ bad anyway she do not comprehend it when she be very young and now she ’ aware that the lack of comprehension suit she now perhaps she do not know on purpose " say betsy with a subtle smile " but anyway it suit she the very same thing do not you see may be look at tragically and turn into a misery or it may be look at simply and even humorously possibly you be incline to look at thing too tragically " " how I should like to know other people just as I know myself " say anna seriously and dreamily " be I bad than other people or well I think I ’m bad " " enfant terrible enfant terrible " repeat betsy " but here they be " they hear the sound of step and a man ’s voice then a woman ’s voice and laughter and immediately thereafter there walk in the expected guest sappho shtoltz and a young man beam with excess of health the socalled vaska it be evident that ample supply of beefsteak truffle and burgundy never fail to reach he at the fitting hour vaska bow to the two lady and glance at they but only for one second he walk after sappho into the drawingroom and follow she about as though he be chain to she keep his sparkle eye fix on she as though he want to eat she sappho shtoltz be a blonde beauty with black eye she walk with smart little step in highheeled shoe and shake hand with the lady vigorously like a man anna have never meet this new star of fashion and be strike by her beauty the exaggerated extreme to which her dress be carry and the boldness of her manner on her head there be such a superstructure of soft golden hair — her own and false mix — that her head be equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust of which so much be expose in front the impulsive abruptness of her movement be such that at every step the line of her knee and the upper part of her leg be distinctly mark under her dress and the question involuntarily rise to the mind where in the undulate piledup mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman so small and slender so naked in front and so hidden behind and below really come to an end betsy make haste to introduce she to anna " only fancy we all but run over two soldier " she begin tell they at once use her eye smile and twitch away her tail which she fling back at one stroke all on one side " I drive here with vaska ah to be sure you do not know each other " and mention his surname she introduce the young man and redden a little break into a ring laugh at her mistake — that be at she have call he vaska to a stranger vaska bow once more to anna but he say nothing to she he address sappho " you ’ve lose your bet we get here first pay up " say he smile sappho laugh still more festively " not just now " say she " oh all right I ’ll have it later " " very well very well oh yes " she turn suddenly to princess betsy " I be a nice person   I positively forget it   I ’ve bring you a visitor and here he come " the unexpected young visitor whom sappho have invite and whom she have forget be however a personage of such consequence that in spite of his youth both the lady rise on his entrance he be a new admirer of sappho ’s he now dog her footstep like vaska soon after prince kaluzhsky arrive and liza merkalova with stremov liza merkalova be a thin brunette with an oriental languid type of face and — as everyone use to say — exquisite enigmatic eye the tone of her dark dress anna immediately observe and appreciate the fact be in perfect harmony with her style of beauty liza be as soft and enervated as sappho be smart and abrupt but to anna ’s taste liza be far more attractive betsy have say to anna that she have adopt the pose of an innocent child but when anna see she she feel that this be not the truth she really be both innocent and corrupt but a sweet and passive woman it be true that her tone be the same as sappho ’s that like sappho she have two man one young and one old tack onto she and devour she with their eye but there be something in she high than what surround she there be in she the glow of the real diamond among glass imitation this glow shine out in her exquisite truly enigmatic eye the weary and at the same time passionate glance of those eye encircle by dark ring impress one by its perfect sincerity everyone look into those eye fancy he know she wholly and know she could not but love she at the sight of anna her whole face light up at once with a smile of delight " ah how glad I be to see you " she say go up to she " yesterday at the race all I want be to get to you but you ’d go away I do so want to see you yesterday especially be not it awful " she say look at anna with eye that seem to lay bare all her soul " yes I have no idea it would be so thrilling " say anna blush the company get up at this moment to go into the garden " I ’m

delightful to look at you you ’re alive but I ’m bored " " how can you be bored why you live in the lively set in petersburg " say anna " possibly the people who be not of our set be even more bored but we — I certainly — be not happy but awfully awfully bored " sappho smoke a cigarette go off into the garden with the two young man betsy and stremov remain at the teatable " what bore " say betsy " sappho say they do enjoy themselves tremendously at your house last night " " ah how dreary it all be " say liza merkalova " we all drive back to my place after the race and always the same people always the same always the same thing we lounge about on sofa all the evening what be there to enjoy in that no do tell I how you manage never to be bored " she say address anna again " one have but to look at you and one see here ’ a woman who may be happy or unhappy but be not bored tell I how you do it " " I do nothing " answer anna blush at these search question " that ’ the good way " stremov put in stremov be a man of fifty partly gray but still vigorouslooking very ugly but with a characteristic and intelligent face liza merkalova be his wife ’s niece and he spend all his leisure hour with she on meet anna karenina as he be alexey alexandrovitch ’s enemy in the government he try like a shrewd man and a man of the world to be particularly cordial with she the wife of his enemy " ' nothing ' " he put in with a subtle smile " that ’ the very good way I tell you long ago " he say turn to liza merkalova " that if you do not want to be bored you must not think you ’re go to be bored it ’ just as you must not be afraid of not be able to fall asleep if you ’re afraid of sleeplessness that ’ just what anna arkadyevna have just say " " I should be very glad if I have say it for it ’ not only clever but true " say anna smile " no do tell I why it be one can not go to sleep and one can not help be bored " " to sleep well one ought to work and to enjoy oneself one ought to work too " " what be I to work for when my work be no use to anybody and I can not and will not knowingly make a pretense about it " " you ’re incorrigible " say stremov not look at she and he speak again to anna as he rarely meet anna he could say nothing but commonplace to she but he say those commonplace as to when she be return to petersburg and how fond countess lidia ivanovna be of she with an expression which suggest that he long with his whole soul to please she and show his regard for she and even more than that tushkevitch come in announce that the party be await the other player to begin croquet " no do not go away please do not " plead liza merkalova hear that anna be go stremov join in her entreaty " it ’ too violent a transition " he say " to go from such company to old madame vrede and besides you will only give she a chance for talk scandal while here you arouse none but such different feeling of the high and most opposite kind " he say to she anna ponder for an instant in uncertainty this shrewd man ’s flattering word the naïve childlike affection show she by liza merkalova and all the social atmosphere she be use to — it be all so easy and what be in store for she be so difficult that she be for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain whether to put off a little long the painful moment of explanation but remember what be in store for she alone at home if she do not come to some decision remember that gesture — terrible even in memory — when she have clutch her hair in both hand — she say goodbye and go away in spite of vronsky ’s apparently frivolous life in society he be a man who hate irregularity in early youth in the corps of page he have experience the humiliation of a refusal when he have try be in difficulty to borrow money and since then he have never once put himself in the same position again in order to keep his affair in some sort of order he use about five time a year more or less frequently accord to circumstance to shut himself up alone and put all his affair into definite shape this he use to call his day of reckoning or faire la lessive on wake up the day after the race vronsky put on a white linen coat and without shave or take his bath he distribute about the table money bill and letter and set to work petritsky who know he be illtempered on such occasion on wake up and see his comrade at the writingtable quietly dress and go out without get in his way every man who know to the minute detail all the complexity of the condition surround he can not help imagine that the complexity of these condition and the difficulty of make they clear be something exceptional and personal peculiar to himself and never suppose that other be surround by just as complicated an array of personal affair as he be so indeed it seem to vronsky and not without inward pride and not without reason he think that any other man would long ago have be in difficulty would have be force to some dishonorable course if he have find himself in such a difficult position but vronsky feel that now especially it be essential for he to clear up and define his position if he be to avoid get into difficulty what vronsky attack first as be the easy be his pecuniary position write out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owe he add up the amount and find that his debt amount to seventeen thousand and some odd hundred which he leave out for the sake of clearness reckon up his money and his bank book he find that he have leave one thousand eight hundred rouble and nothing come in before the new year reckon over again his list of debt vronsky copy it divide it into three class in the first class he put the debt which he would have to pay at once or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not be a moment ’s delay in pay such debt amount to about four thousand one thousand five hundred for a horse and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade venovsky who have lose that sum to a cardsharper in vronsky ’s presence vronsky have want to pay the money at the time he have that amount then but venovsky and yashvin have insist that they would pay and not vronsky who have not play that be so far well but vronsky know that in this dirty business though his only share in it be undertake by word of mouth to be surety for venovsky it be absolutely necessary for he to have the two thousand five hundred rouble so as to be able to fling it at the swindler and have no more word with he and so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand rouble the second class — eight thousand rouble — consist of less important debt these be principally account owe in connection with his race horse to the purveyor of oats and hay the english saddler and so on he would have to pay some two thousand rouble on these debt too in order to be quite free from anxiety the last class of debt — to shop to hotel to his tailor — be such as need not be consider so that he need at least six thousand rouble for current expense and he only have one thousand eight hundred for a man with one hundred thousand rouble of revenue which be what everyone fix as vronsky ’s income such debt one would suppose could hardly be embarrassing but the fact be that he be far from have one hundred thousand his father ’s immense property which alone yield a yearly income of two hundred thousand be leave undivided between the brother at the time when the eld brother with a mass of debt marry princess varya tchirkova the daughter of a decembrist without any fortune whatever alexey have give up to his eld brother almost the whole income from his father ’s estate reserve for himself only twentyfive thousand a year from it alexey have say at the time to his brother that that sum would be sufficient for he until he marry which he probably never would do and his brother who be in command of one of the most expensive regiment and be only just married could not decline the gift his mother who have her own separate property have allow alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twentyfive thousand he have reserve and alexey have spend it all of late his mother incensed with he on account of his love affair and his leave moscow have give up send he the money and in consequence of this vronsky who have be in the habit of live on the scale of fortyfive thousand a year have only receive twenty thousand that year find himself now in difficulty to get out of these difficulty he could not apply to his mother for money her last letter which he have receive the day before have particularly exasperate he by the hint in it that she be quite ready to help he to succeed in the world and in the army but not to lead a life which be a scandal to all good society his mother ’s attempt to buy he sting he to the quick and make he feel cold than ever to she but he could not draw back from the generous word when it be once utter even though he feel now vaguely foresee certain eventuality in his intrigue with madame karenina that this generous word have be speak thoughtlessly and that even though he be not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income but it be impossible to draw back he have only to recall his brother ’s wife to remember how that sweet delightful varya seek at every convenient opportunity to remind he that she remember his generosity and appreciate it to grasp the impossibility of take back his gift it be as impossible as beat a woman steal or lie one thing only could and ought to be do and vronsky determine upon it without an instant ’s hesitation to borrow money from a moneylender ten thousand rouble a proceeding which present no difficulty to cut down his expense generally and to sell his race horse resolve on this he promptly write a note to rolandak who have more than once send to he with offer to buy horse from he then he send for the englishman and the moneylender and divide what money he have accord to the account he intend to pay have finish this business he write a cold and cutting answer to his mother then he take out of his notebook three note of anna ’s read they again burn they and remember their conversation on the previous day he sink into meditation vronsky ’s life be particularly happy in that he have a code of principle which define with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do this code of principle cover only a very small circle of contingency but then the principle be never doubtful and vronsky as he never go outside that circle have never have a moment ’s hesitation about do what he ought to do these principle lay down as invariable rule that one must pay a cardsharper but need not pay a tailor that one must never tell a lie to a man but one may to a woman that one must never cheat anyone but one may a husband that one must never pardon an insult but one may give one and so on these principle be possibly not reasonable and not good but they be of unfailing certainty and so long as he adhere to they vronsky feel that his heart be at peace and he could hold his head up only quite lately in regard to his relation with anna vronsky have begin to feel that his code of principle do not fully cover all possible contingency and to foresee in the future difficulty and perplexity for which he could find no guide clue his present relation to anna and to her husband be to his mind clear and simple it be clearly and precisely define in the code of principle by which he be guide she be an honorable woman who have bestow her love upon he and he love she and therefore she be in his eye a woman who have a right to the same or even more respect than a lawful wife he would have have his hand chop off before he would have allow himself by a word by a hint to humiliate she or even to fall short of the full respect a woman could look for his attitude to society too be clear everyone might know might suspect it but no one might dare to speak of it if any do so he be ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the nonexistent honor of the woman he love his attitude to the husband be the clear of all from the moment that anna love vronsky he have regard his own right over she as the one thing unassailable her husband be simply a superfluous and tiresome person no doubt he be in a pitiable position but how could that be help the one thing the husband have a right to be to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand and vronsky be prepared for this at any minute but of late new inner relation have arise between he and she which frighten vronsky by their indefiniteness only the day before she have tell he that she be with child and he feel that this fact and what she expect of he call for something not fully define in that code of principle by which he have hitherto steer his course in life and he have be indeed catch unawares and at the first moment when she speak to he of her position his heart have prompt he to beg she to leave her husband he have say that but now think thing over he see clearly that it would be well to manage to avoid that and at the same time as he tell himself so he be afraid whether it be not wrong " if I tell she to leave her husband that must mean unite her life with mine be I prepared for that how can I take she away now when I have no money suppose I could arrange but how can I take she away while I ’m in the service if I say that — I ought to be prepared to do it that is I ought to have the money and to retire from the army " and he grow thoughtful the question whether to retire from the service or not bring he to the other and perhaps the chief though hide interest of his life of which none know but he ambition be the old dream of his youth and childhood a dream which he do not confess even to himself though it be so strong that now this passion be even do battle with his love his first step in the world and in the service have be successful but two year before he have make a great mistake anxious to show his independence and to advance he have refuse a post that have be offer he hope that this refusal would heighten his value but it turn out that he have be too bold and he be pass over and have whether he like or not take up for himself the position of an independent man he carry it off with great tact and good sense behave as though he bear no grudge against anyone do not regard himself as injured in any way and care for nothing but to be leave alone since he be enjoy himself in reality he have cease to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before when he go away to moscow he feel that this independent attitude of a man who might have do anything but care to do nothing be already begin to pall that many people be begin to fancy that he be not really capable of anything but be a straightforward goodnatured fellow his connection with madame karenina by create so much sensation and attract general attention have give he a fresh distinction which soothe his gnaw worm of ambition for a while but a week before that worm have be rouse up again with fresh force the friend of his childhood a man of the same set of the same coterie his comrade in the corps of page serpuhovskoy who have leave school with he and have be his rival in class in gymnastic in their scrape and their dream of glory have come back a few day before from central asia where he have gain two step up in rank and an order rarely bestow upon general so young as soon as he arrive in petersburg people begin to talk about he as a newly rise star of the first magnitude a schoolfellow of vronsky ’s and of the same age he be a general and be expect a command which might have influence on the course of political event while vronsky independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman though he be be simply a cavalry captain who be readily allow to be as independent as ever he like " of course I do not envy serpuhovskoy and never could envy he but his advancement show I that one have only to watch one ’s opportunity and the career of a man like I may be very rapidly make three year ago he be in just the same position as I be if I retire I burn my ship if I remain in the army I lose nothing she say herself she do not wish to change her position and with her love I can not feel envious of serpuhovskoy " and slowly twirl his mustache he get up from the table and walk about the room his eye shine particularly brightly and he feel in that confident calm and happy frame of mind which always come after he have thoroughly face his position everything be straight and clear just as after former day of reckoning he shave take a cold bath dress and go out " we ’ve come to fetch you your lessive last a good time today " say petritsky " well be it over " " it be over " answer vronsky smile with his eye only and twirl the tip of his mustache as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affair have be bring any overbold or rapid movement might disturb it " you ’re always just as if you ’d come out of a bath after it " say petritsky " I ’ve come from gritsky ’s " that be what they call the colonel " they ’re expect you " vronsky without answer look at his comrade think of something else " yes be that music at his place " he say listen to the familiar sound of polka and waltz float across to he " what ’ the fête " " serpuhovskoy ’ come " " aha " say vronsky " why I do not know " the smile in his eye gleam more brightly than ever have once make up his mind that he be happy in his love that he sacrifice his ambition to it — have anyway take up this position vronsky be incapable of feel either envious of serpuhovskoy or hurt with he for not come first to he when he come to the regiment serpuhovskoy be a good friend and he be delighted he have come " ah I ’m very glad " the colonel demin have take a large country house the whole party be in the wide low balcony in the courtyard the first object that meet vronsky ’s eye be a band of singer in white linen coat stand near a barrel of vodka and the robust goodhumored figure of the colonel surround by officer he have go out as far as the first step of the balcony and be loudly shout across the band that play offenbach ’s quadrille wave his arm and give some order to a few soldier stand on one side a group of soldier a quartermaster and several subaltern come up to the balcony with vronsky the colonel return to the table go out again onto the step with a tumbler in his hand and propose the toast " to the health of our former comrade the gallant general prince serpuhovskoy hurrah " the colonel be follow by serpuhovskoy who come out onto the step smile with a glass in his hand " you always get young bondarenko " he say to the rosychecked smartlooking quartermaster stand just before he still youngish looking though do his second term of service it be three year since vronsky have see serpuhovskoy he look more robust have let his whisker grow but be still the same graceful creature whose face and figure be even more striking from their softness and nobility than their beauty the only change vronsky detect in he be that subdued continual radiance of beam content which settle on the face of man who be successful and be sure of the recognition of their success by everyone vronsky know that radiant air and immediately observe it in serpuhovskoy as serpuhovskoy come down the step he see vronsky a smile of pleasure light up his face he toss his head upwards and wave the glass in his hand greet vronsky and show he by the gesture that he could not come to he before the quartermaster who stand crane forward his lip ready to be kiss " here he be " shout the colonel " yashvin tell I you be in one of your gloomy temper " serpuhovskoy kiss the moist fresh lip of the gallantlooking quartermaster and wipe his mouth with his handkerchief go up to vronsky " how glad I be " he say squeeze his hand and draw he on one side " you look after he " the colonel shout to yashvin point to vronsky and he go down below to the soldier " why be not you at the race yesterday I expect to see you there " say vronsky scrutinize serpuhovskoy " I do go but late I beg your pardon " he add and he turn to the adjutant " please have this divide from I each man as much as it run to " and he hurriedly take note for three hundred rouble from his pocketbook blush a little " vronsky have anything to eat or drink " ask yashvin " hi something for the count to eat ah here it be have a glass " the fête at the colonel ’s last a long while there be a great deal of drinking they toss serpuhovskoy in the air and catch he again several time then they do the same to the colonel then to the accompaniment of the band the colonel himself dance with petritsky then the colonel who begin to show sign of feebleness sit down on a bench in the courtyard and begin demonstrate to yashvin the superiority of russia over prussia especially in cavalry attack and there be a lull in the revelry for a moment serpuhovskoy go into the house to the bathroom to wash his hand and find vronsky there vronsky be drench his head with water he have take off his coat and put his sunburnt hairy neck under the tap and be rub it and his head with his hand when he have finish vronsky sit down by serpuhovskoy they both sit down in the bathroom on a lounge and a conversation begin which be very interesting to both of they " I ’ve always be hear about you through my wife " say serpuhovskoy " I ’m glad you ’ve be see she pretty often " " she ’ friendly with varya and they ’re the only woman in petersburg I care about see " answer vronsky smile he smile because he foresee the topic the conversation would turn on and he be glad of it " the only one " serpuhovskoy query smile " yes and I hear news of you but not only through your wife " say vronsky check his hint by a stern expression of face " I be greatly delighted to hear of your success but not a bit surprised I expect even more " serpuhovskoy smile such an opinion of he be obviously agreeable to he and he do not think it necessary to conceal it " well I on the contrary expect less — i’ll own frankly but I ’m glad very glad I ’m ambitious that ’ my weakness and I confess to it " " perhaps you would not confess to it if you have not be successful " say vronsky " I do not suppose so " say serpuhovskoy smile again " I will not say life would not be worth live without it but it would be dull of course I may be mistaken but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the line I ’ve choose and that power of any sort in my hand if it be to be will be well than in the hand of a good many people I know " say serpuhovskoy with beaming consciousness of success " and so the near I get to it the well pleased I be " " perhaps that be true for you but not for everyone I use to think so too but here I live and think life worth live not only for that " " there it ’ out here it come " say serpuhovskoy laugh " ever since I hear about you about your refusal I begin of course I approve of what you do but there be way of do everything and I think your action be good in itself but you do not do it quite in the way you ought to have do " " what ’ do can not be undo and you know I never go back on what I ’ve do and besides I ’m very well off " " very well off — for the time but you ’re not satisfied with that I would not say this to your brother he ’ a nice child like our host here there he go " he add listen to the roar of " hurrah”—“and he ’ happy but that do not satisfy you " " I do not say it do satisfy I " " yes but that ’ not the only thing such man as you be want " " by whom " " by whom by society by russia russia need man she need a party or else everything go and will go to the dog " " how do you mean bertenev ’s party against the russian communists " " no " say serpuhovskoy frown with vexation at be suspect of such an absurdity " tout ça est une blague that ’ always be and always will be there be no communists but intriguing people have to invent a noxious dangerous party it ’ an old trick no what ’ want be a powerful party of independent man like you and I " " but why so " vronsky mention a few man who be in power " why be not they independent man " " simply because they have not or have not have from birth an independent fortune they ’ve not have a name they ’ve not be close to the sun and center as we have they can be buy either by money or by favor and they have to find a support for themselves in invent a policy and they bring forward some notion some policy that they do not believe in that do harm and the whole policy be really only a means to a government house and so much income cela n’est pas plus fin que ça when you get a peep at their card I may be inferior to they stupid perhaps though I do not see why I should be inferior to they but you and I have one important advantage over they for certain in be more difficult to buy and such man be more needed than ever " vronsky listen attentively but he be not so much interested by the meaning of the word as by the attitude of serpuhovskoy who be already contemplate a struggle with the exist power and already have his like and dislike in that high world while his own interest in the govern world do not go beyond the interest of his regiment vronsky feel too how powerful serpuhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for think thing out and for take thing in through his intelligence and gift of word so rarely meet with in the world in which he move and ashamed as he be of the feeling he feel envious " still I have not the one thing of most importance for that " he answer " I have not the desire for power I have it once but it ’ go " " excuse I that ’ not true " say serpuhovskoy smile " yes it be true it be true   now " vronsky add to be truthful " yes it ’ true now that ’ another thing but that now will not last forever " " perhaps " answer vronsky " you say perhaps " serpuhovskoy go on as though guess his thought " but I say for certain and that ’ what I want to see you for your action be just what it should have be I see that but you ought not to keep it up I only ask you to give I carte blanche I ’m not go to offer you my protection   though indeed why should not I protect you — you’ve protect I often enough I should hope our friendship rise above all that sort of thing yes " he say smile to he as tenderly as a woman " give I carte blanche retire from the regiment and I ’ll draw you upwards imperceptibly " " but you must understand that I want nothing " say vronsky " except that all should be as it be " serpuhovskoy get up and stand face he " you say that all should be as it be I understand what that mean but listen we ’re the same age you ’ve know a great number of woman perhaps than I have " serpohovskoy ’s smile and gesture tell vronsky that he must not be afraid that he would be tender and careful in touch the sore place " but I ’m married and believe I in get to know thoroughly one ’s wife if one love she as someone have say one get to know all woman well than if one know thousand of they " " we ’re come directly " vronsky shout to an officer who look into the room and call they to the colonel vronsky be long now to hear to the end and know what serpuhovskey would say to he " and here ’ my opinion for you woman be the chief stumbling block in a man ’s career it ’ hard to love a woman and do anything there ’ only one way of have love conveniently without its be a hindrance — that ’ marriage how how be I to tell you what I mean " say serpuhovskoy who like similes " wait a minute wait a minute yes just as you can only carry a fardeau and do something with your hand when the fardeau be tie on your back and that ’ marriage and that ’ what I feel when I be marry my hand be suddenly set free but to drag that fardeau about with you without marriage your hand will always be so full that you can do nothing look at mazankov at krupov they ’ve ruin their career for the sake of woman " " what woman " say vronsky recall the frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two man he have mention be connect " the firm the woman ’s footing in society the bad it be that ’ much the same as — not merely carry the fardeau in your arm — but tear it away from someone else " " you have never love " vronsky say softly look straight before he and think of anna " perhaps but you remember what I ’ve say to you and another thing woman be all more materialistic than man we make something immense out of love but they be always terreàterre " " directly directly " he cry to a footman who come in but the footman have not come to call they again as he suppose the footman bring vronsky a note " a man bring it from princess tverskaya " vronsky open the letter and flush crimson " my head ’ begin to ache I ’m go home " he say to serpuhovskoy " oh goodbye then you give I carte blanche " " we ’ll talk about it later on I ’ll look you up in petersburg " it be six o’clock already and so in order to be there quickly and at the same time not to drive with his own horse know to everyone vronsky get into yashvin ’s hire fly and tell the driver to drive as quickly as possible it be a roomy oldfashioned fly with seat for four he sit in one corner stretch his leg out on the front seat and sink into meditation a vague sense of the order into which his affair have be bring a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of serpuhovskoy who have consider he a man that be need and most of all the anticipation of the interview before he — all blend into a general joyous sense of life this feeling be so strong that he could not help smile he drop his leg cross one leg over the other knee and take it in his hand feel the springy muscle of the calf where it have be graze the day before by his fall and lean back he draw several deep breath " I ’m happy very happy " he say to himself he have often before have this sense of physical joy in his own body but he have never feel so fond of himself of his own body as at that moment he enjoy the slight ache in his strong leg he enjoy the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathe the bright cold august day which have make anna feel so hopeless seem to he keenly stimulating and refresh his face and neck that still tingle from the cold water the scent of brilliantine on his whisker strike he as particularly pleasant in the fresh air everything he see from the carriage window everything in that cold pure air in the pale light of the sunset be as fresh and gay and strong as he be himself the roof of the house shine in the ray of the set sun the sharp outline of fence and angle of building the figure of passersby the carriage that meet he now and then the motionless green of the tree and grass the field with evenly draw furrow of potato and the slant shadow that fall from the house and tree and bush and even from the row of potato — everything be bright like a pretty landscape just finish and freshly varnish " get on get on " he say to the driver put his head out of the window and pull a threerouble note out of his pocket he hand it to the man as he look round the driver ’s hand fumble with something at the lamp the whip crack and the carriage roll rapidly along the smooth highroad " I want nothing nothing but this happiness " he think stare at the bone button of the bell in the space between the window and picture to himself anna just as he have see she last time " and as I go on I love she more and more here ’ the garden of the vrede villa whereabouts will she be where how why do she fix on this place to meet I and why do she write in betsy ’s letter " he think wonder now for the first time at it but there be now no time for wonder he call to the driver to stop before reach the avenue and open the door jump out of the carriage as it be move and go into the avenue that lead up to the house there be no one in the avenue but look round to the right he catch sight of she her face be hide by a veil but he drink in with glad eye the special movement in walk peculiar to she alone the slope of the shoulder and the setting of the head and at once a sort of electric shock run all over he with fresh force he feel conscious of himself from the springy motion of his leg to the movement of his lung as he breathe and something set his lip twitch join he she press his hand tightly " you ’re not angry that I send for you I absolutely have to see you " she say and the serious and set line of her lip which he see under the veil transform his mood at once " I angry but how have you come where from " " never mind " she say lay her hand on his " come along I must talk to you " he see that something have happen and that the interview would not be a joyous one in her presence he have no will of his own without know the ground of her distress he already feel the same distress unconsciously pass over he " what be it what " he ask she squeeze her hand with his elbow and try to read her thought in her face she walk on a few step in silence gather up her courage then suddenly she stop " I do not tell you yesterday " she begin breathe quickly and painfully " that come home with alexey alexandrovitch I tell he everything   tell he I could not be his wife that   and tell he everything " he hear she unconsciously bend his whole figure down to she as though hope in this way to soften the hardness of her position for she but directly she have say this he suddenly draw himself up and a proud and hard expression come over his face " yes yes that ’ well a thousand time well I know how painful it be " he say but she be not listen to his word she be read his thought from the expression of his face she could not guess that that expression arise from the first idea that present itself to vronsky — that a duel be now inevitable the idea of a duel have never cross her mind and so she put a different interpretation on this pass expression of hardness when she get her husband ’s letter she know then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position to abandon her son and to join her lover the morning spend at princess tverskaya ’s have confirm she still more in this but this interview be still of the utmost gravity for she she hope that this interview would transform her position and save she if on hear this news he be to say to she resolutely passionately without an instant ’s waver " throw up everything and come with I " she would give up her son and go away with he but this news have not produce what she have expect in he he simply seem as though he be resent some affront " it be not in the least painful to I it happen of itself " she say irritably " and see " she pull her husband ’s letter out of her glove " I understand I understand " he interrupt she take the letter but not read it and try to soothe she " the one thing I long for the one thing I pray for be to cut short this position so as to devote my life to your happiness " " why do you tell I that " she say " do you suppose I can doubt it if I doubt " " who ’ that come " say vronsky suddenly point to two lady walk towards they " perhaps they know we " and he hurriedly turn off draw she after he into a side path " oh I do not care " she say her lip be quiver and he fancy that her eye look with strange fury at he from under the veil " I tell you that ’ not the point — I can not doubt that but see what he write to I read it " she stand still again again just as at the first moment of hear of her rupture with her husband vronsky on read the letter be unconsciously carry away by the natural sensation arouse in he by his own relation to the betray husband now while he hold his letter in his hand he could not help picture the challenge which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow and the duel itself in which with the same cold and haughty expression that his face be assume at this moment he would await the injure husband ’s shot after have himself fire into the air and at that instant there flash across his mind the thought of what serpuhovskoy have just say to he and what he have himself be think in the morning — that it be well not to bind himself — and he know that this thought he could not tell she have read the letter he raise his eye to she and there be no determination in they she see at once that he have be think about it before by himself she know that whatever he might say to she he would not you all he think and she know that her last hope have fail she this be not what she have be reckon on " you see the sort of man he be " she say with a shake voice " he " " forgive I but I rejoice at it " vronsky interrupt " for god ’s sake let I finish " he add his eye implore she to give he time to explain his word " I rejoice because thing can not can not possibly remain as he suppose " " why can not they " anna say restrain her tear and obviously attach no sort of consequence to what he say she feel that her fate be seal vronsky mean that after the duel — inevitable he think — thing could not go on as before but he say something different " it can not go on I hope that now you will leave he I hope”—he be confused and reddened—“that you will let I arrange and plan our life tomorrow " he be begin she do not let he go on " but my child " she shriek " you see what he write I should have to leave he and I can not and will not do that " " but for god ’s sake which be well — leave your child or keep up this degrading position " " to whom be it degrading " " to all and most of all to you " " you say degrading   do not say that those word have no meaning for I " she say in a shake voice she do not want he now to say what be untrue she have nothing leave she but his love and she want to love he " do not you understand that from the day I love you everything have change for I for I there be one thing and one thing only — your love if that ’ mine I feel so exalted so strong that nothing can be humiliating to I I be proud of my position because   proud of be   proud " she could not say what she be proud of tear of shame and despair choke her utterance she stand still and sob he feel too something swell in his throat and twitch in his nose and for the first time in his life he feel on the point of weeping he could not have say exactly what it be touch he so he feel sorry for she and he feel he could not help she and with that he know that he be to blame for her wretchedness and that he have do something wrong " be not a divorce possible " he say feebly

prepare it now he feel that the import of his speech be of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight meantime as he listen to the usual report he have the most innocent and inoffensive air no one look at his white hand with their swollen vein and long finger so softly stroke the edge of the white paper that lie before he and at the air of weariness with which his head droop on one

answer he add " I shall not be dine at home today and I have get to go out directly " " I have think of go to moscow " she say " no you do quite quite right to come " he say and be silent again see that he be powerless to begin the conversation she begin herself " alexey alexandrovitch " she say look at he and not drop her eye under his persistent gaze at her hair " I ’m a guilty woman I ’m a bad woman but I be the same as I be as I tell you then and I have come to tell you that I can change nothing " " I have ask you no question about that " he say all at once resolutely and with hatred look she straight in the face " that be as I have suppose " under the influence of anger he apparently regain complete possession of all his faculty " but as I tell you then and have write to you " he say in a thin shrill voice " I repeat now that I be not bind to know this I ignore it not all wife be so kind as you to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husband " he lay special emphasis on the word " agreeable " " I shall ignore it so long as the world know nothing of it so long as my name be not disgrace and so I simply inform you that our relation must be just as they have always be and that only in the event of your compromise I I shall be oblige to take step to secure my honor " " but our relation can not be the same as always " anna begin in a timid voice look at he with dismay when she see once more those compose gesture hear that shrill childish and sarcastic voice her aversion for he extinguish her pity for he and she feel only afraid but at all cost she want to make clear her position " I can not be your wife while I " she begin he laugh a cold and malignant laugh " the manner of life you have choose be reflect I suppose in your idea I have too much respect or contempt or both   I respect your past and despise your present   that I be far from the interpretation you put on my word " anna sigh and bow her head " though indeed I fail to comprehend how with the independence you show " he go on get hot " — announce your infidelity to your husband and see nothing reprehensible in it apparently — you can see anything reprehensible in perform a wife ’s duty in relation to your husband " " alexey alexandrovitch what be it you want of I " " I want you not to meet that man here and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servant can reproach you   not to see he that ’ not much I think and in return you will you all the privilege of a faithful wife without fulfil her duty that ’ all I have to say to you now it ’ time for I to go I ’m not dine at home " he get up and move towards the door anna get up too bow in silence he let she pass before he the night spend by levin on the haycock do not pass without result for he the way in which he have be manage his land revolt he and have lose all attraction for he in spite of the magnificent harvest never have there be or at least never it seem to he have there be so many hindrance and so many quarrel between he and the peasant as that year and the origin of these failure and this hostility be now perfectly comprehensible to he the delight he have experience in the work itself and the consequent great intimacy with the peasant the envy he feel of they of their life the desire to adopt that life which have be to he that night not a dream but an intention the execution of which he have think out in detail — all this have so transform his view of the farming of the land as he have manage it that he could not take his former interest in it and could not help see that unpleasant relation between he and the workpeople which be the foundation of it all the herd of improved cow such as pava the whole land plough over and enrich the nine level field surround with hedge the two hundred and forty acre heavily manure the seed sow in drill and all the rest of it — it be all splendid if only the work have be do for themselves or for themselves and comrade — people in sympathy with they but he see clearly now his work on a book of agriculture in which the chief element in husbandry be to have be the laborer greatly assist he in this that the sort of farming he be carry on be nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between he and the laborer in which there be on one side — his side — a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he consider well on the other side the natural order of thing and in this struggle he see that with immense expenditure of force on his side and with no effort or even intention on the other side all that be attain be that the work do not go to the liking of either side and that splendid tool splendid cattle and land be spoil with no good to anyone bad of all the energy expend on this work be not simply waste he could not help feel now since the meaning of this system have become clear to he that the aim of his energy be a most unworthy one in reality what be the struggle about he be struggle for every farthing of his share and he could not help it for he have only to relax his effort and he would not have have the money to pay his laborer ' wage while they be only struggle to be able to do their work easily and agreeably that be to say as they be use to do it it be for his interest that every laborer should work as hard as possible and that while do so he should keep his wit about he so as to try not to break the winnowing machine the horse rake the thrash machine that he should attend to what he be do what the laborer want be to work as pleasantly as possible with rest and above all carelessly and heedlessly without think that summer levin see this at every step he send the man to mow some clover for hay pick out the bad patch where the clover be overgrow with grass and weed and of no use for seed again and again they mow the good acre of clover justify themselves by the pretense that the bailiff have tell they to and try to pacify he with the assurance that it would be splendid hay but he know that it be owe to those acre be so much easy to mow he send out a hay machine for pitch the hay — it be break at the first row because it be dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wing wave above he and he be tell " do not trouble your honor sure the womenfolk will pitch it quick enough " the plough be practically useless because it never occur to the laborer to raise the share when he turn the plough and force it round he strain the horse and tear up the ground and levin be beg not to mind about it the horse be allow to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be nightwatchman and in spite of order to the contrary the laborer insist on take turn for night duty and ivan after work all day long fall asleep and be very penitent for his fault say " do what you will to I your honor " they kill three of the good calf by let they into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking and nothing would make the man believe that they have be blow out by the clover but they tell he by way of consolation that one of his neighbor have lose a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three you all this happen not because anyone feel illwill to levin or his farm on the contrary he know that they like he think he a simple gentleman their high praise but it happen simply because all they want be to work merrily and carelessly and his interest be not only remote and incomprehensible to they but fatally opposed to their most just claim long before levin have feel dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land he see where his boat leak but he do not look for the leak perhaps purposely deceive himself nothing would be leave he if he lose faith in it but now he could deceive himself no long the farming of the land as he be manage it have become not merely unattractive but revolting to he and he could take no further interest in it to this now be join the presence only twentyfive mile off of kitty shtcherbatskaya whom he long to see and could not see darya alexandrovna oblonskaya have invite he when he be over there to come to come with the object of renew his offer to her sister who would so she give he to understand accept he now levin himself have feel on see kitty shtcherbatskaya that he have never cease to love she but he could not go over to the oblonskys ' know she be there the fact that he have make she an offer and she have refuse he have place an insuperable barrier between she and he " I can not ask she to be my wife merely because she can not be the wife of the man she want to marry " he say to himself the thought of this make he cold and hostile to she " I should not be able to speak to she without a feeling of reproach I could not look at she without resentment and she will only hate I all the more as she ’ bind to and besides how can I now after what darya alexandrovna tell I go to see they can I help show that I know what she tell I and I to go magnanimously to forgive she and have pity on she I go through a performance before she of forgive and deign to bestow my love on she what induce darya alexandrovna to tell I that by chance I might have see she then everything would have happen of itself but as it be it ’ out of the question out of the question " darya alexandrovna send he a letter ask he for a sidesaddle for kitty ’s use " I ’m tell you have a sidesaddle " she write to he " I hope you will bring it over yourself " this be more than he could stand how could a woman of any intelligence of any delicacy put her sister in such a humiliating position he write ten note and tear they all up and send the saddle without any reply to write that he would go be impossible because he could not go to write that he could not come because something prevent he or that he would be away that be still bad he send the saddle without an answer and with a sense of have do something shameful he hand over all the now revolting business of the estate to the bailiff and set off next day to a remote district to see his friend sviazhsky who have splendid marsh for grouse in his neighborhood and have lately write to ask he to keep a longstanding promise to stay with he the grousemarsh in the surovsky district have long tempt levin but he have continually put off this visit on account of his work on the estate now he be glad to get away from the neighborhood of the shtcherbatskys and still more from his farm work especially on a shooting expedition which always in trouble serve as the good consolation in the surovsky district there be no railway nor service of post horse and levin drive there with his own horse in his big oldfashioned carriage he stop halfway at a welltodo peasant ’s to feed his horse a bald wellpreserved old man with a broad red beard gray on his cheek open the gate squeeze against the gatepost to let the three horse pass direct the coachman to a place under the shed in the big clean tidy yard with charred oldfashioned plough in it the old man ask levin to come into the parlor a cleanly dress young woman with clog on her bare foot be scrub the floor in the new outer room she be frightened of the dog that run in after levin and utter a shriek but begin laugh at her own fright at once when she be tell the dog would not hurt she point levin with her bare arm to the door into the parlor she bend down again hide her handsome face and go on scrub " would you like the samovar " she ask " yes please " the parlor be a big room with a dutch stove and a screen divide it into two under the holy picture stand a table paint in pattern a bench and two chair near the entrance be a dresser full of crockery the shutter be closed there be few fly and it be so clean that levin be anxious that laska who have be run along the road and bathe in puddle should not muddy the floor and order she to a place in the corner by the door after look round the parlor levin go out in the back yard the goodlooking young woman in clog swinge the empty pail on the yoke run on before he to the well for water " look sharp my girl " the old man shout after she goodhumoredly and he go up to levin " well sir be you go to nikolay ivanovitch sviazhsky his honor come to we too " he begin chat lean his elbow on the railing of the step in the middle of the old man ’s account of his acquaintance with sviazhsky the gate creak again and laborer come into the yard from the field with wooden plough and harrow the horse harness to the plough and harrow be sleek and fat the laborer be obviously of the household two be young man in cotton shirt and cap the two other be hire laborer in homespun shirt one an old man the other a young fellow move off from the step the old man go up to the horse and begin unharness they " what have they be plough " ask levin " plough up the potato we rent a bit of land too fedot do not let out the gelding but take it to the trough and we ’ll put the other in harness " " oh father the ploughshare I order have he bring they along " ask the big healthylooking fellow obviously the old man ’s son " there   in the outer room " answer the old man bundle together the harness he have take off and fling it on the ground " you can put they on while they have dinner " the goodlooking young woman come into the outer room with the full pail drag at her shoulder more woman come on the scene from somewhere young and handsome middleaged old and ugly with child and without child the samovar be begin to sing the laborer and the family have dispose of the horse come in to dinner levin get his provision out of his carriage invite the old man to take tea with he " well I have have some today already " say the old man obviously accept the invitation with pleasure " but just a glass for company " over their tea levin hear all about the old man ’s farming ten year before the old man have rent three hundred acre from the lady who own they and a year ago he have buy they and rent another three hundred from a neighbor landowner a small part of the land — the bad part — he let out for rent while a hundred acre of arable land he cultivate himself with his family and two hire laborer the old man complain that thing be do badly but levin see that he simply do so from a feeling of propriety and that his farm be in a flourishing condition if it have be unsuccessful he would not have buy land at thirtyfive rouble the acre he would not have marry his three son and a nephew he would not have rebuild twice after fire and each time on a large scale in spite of the old man ’s complaint it be evident that he be proud and justly proud of his prosperity proud of his son his nephew his son ' wife his horse and his cow and especially of the fact that he be keep all this farming go from his conversation with the old man levin think he be not averse to new method either he have plant a great many potato and his potato as levin have see drive past be already past flower and begin to die down while levin ’s be only just come into flower he earth up his potato with a modern plough borrow from a neighbor landowner he sow wheat the trifling fact that thin out his rye the old man use the rye he thin out for his horse specially strike levin how many time have levin see this splendid fodder waste and try to get it save but always it have turn out to be impossible the peasant get this do and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beast " what have the wench to do they carry it out in bundle to the roadside and the cart bring it away " " well we landowner can not manage well with our laborer " say levin hand he a glass of tea " thank you " say the old man and he take the glass but refuse sugar point to a lump he have leave " they ’re simple destruction " say he " look at sviazhsky ’s for instance we know what the land ’ like — firstrate yet there ’ not much of a crop to boast of it ’ not look after enough — that ’ all it be " " but you work your land with hire laborer " " we ’re all peasant together we go into everything ourselves if a man ’ no use he can go and we can manage by ourselves " " father finogen want some tar " say the young woman in the clog come in " yes yes that ’ how it be sir " say the old man get up and cross himself deliberately he thank levin and go out when levin go into the kitchen to call his coachman he see the whole family at dinner the woman be stand up wait on they the young sturdylooking son be tell something funny with his mouth full of pudding and they be all laugh the woman in the clog who be pour cabbage soup into a bowl laugh most merrily of all very probably the goodlooking face of the young woman in the clog have a good deal to do with the impression of wellbeing this peasant household make upon levin but the impression be so strong that levin could never get rid of it and all the way from the old peasant ’s to sviazhsky ’s he keep recall this peasant farm as though there be something in this impression that demand his special attention sviazhsky be the marshal of his district he be five year old than levin and have long be marry his sisterinlaw a young girl levin like very much live in his house and levin know that sviazhsky and his wife would have greatly like to marry the girl to he he know this with certainty as socalled eligible young man always know it though he could never have bring himself to speak of it to anyone and he know too that although he want to get marry and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife he could no more have marry she even if he have not be in love with kitty shtcherbatskaya than he could have fly up to the sky and this knowledge poison the pleasure he have hope to find in the visit to sviazhsky on get sviazhsky ’s letter with the invitation for shooting levin have immediately think of this but in spite of it he have make up his mind that sviazhsky ’s have such view for he be simply his own groundless supposition and so he would go all the same besides at the bottom of his heart he have a desire to try himself put himself to the test in regard to this girl the sviazhskys ' homelife be exceedingly pleasant and sviazhsky himself the good type of man take part in local affair that levin know be very interesting to he sviazhsky be one of those people always a source of wonder to levin whose conviction very logical though never original go one way by themselves while their life exceedingly definite and firm in its direction go its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their conviction sviazhsky be an extremely advanced man he despise the nobility and believe the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom and only conceal their view from cowardice he regard russia as a ruined country rather after the style of turkey and the government of russia as so bad that he never permit himself to criticize its doing seriously and yet he be a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility and when he drive about he always wear the cockade of office and the cap with the red band he consider human life only tolerable abroad and go abroad to stay at every opportunity and at the same time he carry on a complex and improved system of agriculture in russia and with extreme interest follow everything and know everything that be be do in russia he consider the russian peasant as occupy a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man and at the same time in the local assembly no one be ready to shake hand with the peasant and listen to their opinion he believe neither in god nor the devil but be much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenue and take special trouble to keep up the church in his village on the woman question he be on the side of the extreme advocate of complete liberty for woman and especially their right to labor but he live with his wife on such term that their affectionate childless home life be the admiration of everyone and arrange his wife ’s life so that she do nothing and could do nothing but share her husband ’s effort that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible if it have not be a characteristic of levin ’s to put the most favorable interpretation on people sviazhsky ’s character would have present no doubt or difficulty to he he would have say to himself " a fool or a knave " and everything would have seem clear but he could not say " a fool " because sviazhsky be unmistakably clever and moreover a highly cultivate man who be exceptionally modest over his culture there be not a subject he know nothing of but he do not display his knowledge except when he be compel to do so still less could levin say that he be a knave as sviazhsky be unmistakably an honest goodhearted sensible man who work goodhumoredly keenly and perseveringly at his work he be hold in high honor by everyone about he and certainly he have never consciously do and be indeed incapable of do anything base levin try to understand he and could not understand he and look at he and his life as at a live enigma levin and he be very friendly and so levin use to venture to sound sviazhsky to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life but it be always in vain every time levin try to penetrate beyond the outer chamber of sviazhsky ’s mind which be hospitably open to all he notice that sviazhsky be slightly disconcerted faint sign of alarm be visible in his eye as though he be afraid levin would understand he and he would give he a kindly goodhumored repulse just now since his disenchantment with farm levin be particularly glad to stay with sviazhsky apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple so pleased with themselves and everyone else and their wellordered home have always a cheering effect on levin he feel a longing now that he be so dissatisfied with his own life to get at that secret in sviazhsky that give he such clearness definiteness and good courage in life moreover levin know that at sviazhsky ’s he should meet the landowner of the neighborhood and it be particularly interesting for he just now to hear and take part in those rural conversation concern crop laborer ' wage and so on which he be aware be conventionally regard as something very low but which seem to he just now to constitute the one subject of importance " it be not perhaps of importance in the day of serfdom and it may not be of importance in england in both case the condition of agriculture be firmly establish but among we now when everything have be turn upside down and be only just take shape the question what form these condition will take be the one question of importance in russia " think levin the shooting turn out to be bad than levin have expect the marsh be dry and there be no grouse at all he walk about the whole day and only bring back three bird but to make up for that — he bring back as he always do from shoot an excellent appetite excellent spirit and that keen intellectual mood which with he always accompany violent physical exertion and while out shoot when he seem to be think of nothing at all suddenly the old man and his family keep come back to his mind and the impression of they seem to claim not merely his attention but the solution of some question connect with they in the evening at tea two landowner who have come about some business connect with a wardship be of the party and the interesting conversation levin have be look forward to spring up levin be sit beside his hostess at the tea table and be oblige to keep up a conversation with she and her sister who be sit opposite he madame sviazhskaya be a roundfaced fairhaired rather short woman all smile and dimple levin try through she to get a solution of the weighty enigma her husband present to his mind but he have not complete freedom of idea because he be in an agony of embarrassment this agony of embarrassment be due to the fact that the sisterinlaw be sit opposite to he in a dress specially put on as he fancy for his benefit cut particularly open in the shape of a trapeze on her white bosom this quadrangular opening in spite of the bosom ’s be very white or just because it be very white deprive levin of the full use of his faculty he imagine probably mistakenly that this lownecked bodice have be make on his account and feel that he have no right to look at it and try not to look at it but he feel that he be to blame for the very fact of the lownecked bodice have be make it seem to levin that he have deceive someone that he ought to explain something but that to explain it be impossible and for that reason he be continually blush be ill at ease and awkward his awkwardness infect the pretty sisterinlaw too but their hostess appear not to observe this and keep purposely draw she into the conversation " you say " she say pursue the subject that have be start " that my husband can not be interested in what ’ russian it ’ quite the contrary he be always in cheerful spirit abroad but not as he be here here he feel in his proper place he have so much to do and he have the faculty of interest himself in everything oh you ’ve not be to see our school have you " " I ’ve see it the little house cover with ivy be not it " " yes that ’ nastia ’s work " she say indicate her sister " you teach in it yourself " ask levin try to look above the open neck but feel that wherever he look in that direction he should see it " yes I use to teach in it myself and do teach still but we have a firstrate schoolmistress now and we ’ve start gymnastic exercise " " no thank you I will not have any more tea " say levin and conscious of do a rude thing but incapable of continue the conversation he get up blush " I hear a very interesting conversation " he add and walk to the other end of the table where sviazhsky be sit with the two gentleman of the neighborhood sviazhsky be sit sideways with one elbow on the table and a cup in one hand while with the other hand he gather up his beard hold it to his nose and let it drop again as though he be smell it his brilliant black eye be look straight at the excited country gentleman with gray whisker and apparently he derive amusement from his remark the gentleman be complain of the peasant it be evident to levin that sviazhsky know an answer to this gentleman ’s complaint which would at once demolish his whole contention but that in his position he could not give utterance to this answer and listen not without pleasure to the landowner ’s comic speech the gentleman with the gray whisker be obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist who have live all his life in the country levin see proof of this in his dress in the oldfashioned threadbare coat obviously not his everyday attire in his shrewd deepset eye in his idiomatic fluent russian in the imperious tone that have become habitual from long use and in the resolute gesture of his large red sunburnt hand with an old betrothal ring on the little finger " if I ’d only the heart to throw up what ’ be set go   such a lot of trouble waste   I ’d turn my back on the whole business sell up go off like nikolay ivanovitch   to hear la belle hélène " say the landowner a pleasant smile light up his shrewd old face " but you see you do not throw it up " say nikolay ivanovitch sviazhsky " so there must be something gain " " the only gain be that I live in my own house neither buy nor hire besides one keep hope the people will learn sense though instead of that you ’d never believe it — the drunkenness the immorality they keep chop and change their bit of land not a sight of a horse or a cow the peasant ’ die of hunger but just go and take he on as a laborer he ’ll do his good to do you a mischief and then bring you up before the justice of the peace " " but then you make complaint to the justice too " say sviazhsky " I lodge complaint not for anything in the world such a talking and such a todo that one would have cause to regret it at the work for instance they pocket the advancemoney and make off what do the justice do why acquit they nothing keep they in order but their own communal court and their village elder he ’ll flog they in the good old style but for that there ’d be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away " obviously the landowner be chaff sviazhsky who far from resent it be apparently amuse by it " but you see we manage our land without such extreme measure " say he smile " levin and I and this gentleman " he indicate the other landowner " yes the thing ’ do at mihail petrovitch ’s but ask he how it ’ do do you call that a rational system " say the landowner obviously rather proud of the word " rational " " my system ’ very simple " say mihail petrovitch " thank god all my management rest on get the money ready for the autumn taxis and the peasant come to I ' father master help we ' well the peasant be all one ’s neighbor one feel for they so one advance they a third but one say ' remember lad I have help you and you must help I when I need it — whether it ’ the sowing of the oats or the haycutting or the harvest ' and well one agree so much for each taxpayer — though there be dishonest one among they too it ’ true " levin who have long be familiar with these patriarchal method exchange glance with sviazhsky and interrupt mihail petrovitch turn again to the gentleman with the gray whisker " then what do you think " he ask " what system be one to adopt nowadays " " why manage like mihail petrovitch or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasant that one can do — only that ’ just how the general prosperity of the country be be ruin where the land with serflabor and good management give a yield of nine to one on the halfcrop system it yield three to one russia have be ruin by the emancipation " sviazhsky look with smile eye at levin and even make a faint gesture of irony to he but levin do not think the landowner ’s word absurd he understand they well than he do sviazhsky a great deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whisker say to show in what way russia be ruin by the emancipation strike he indeed as very true new to he and quite incontestable the landowner unmistakably speak his own individual thought — a thing that very rarely happen — and a thought to which he have be bring not by a desire of find some exercise for an idle brain but a thought which have grow up out of the condition of his life which he have brood over in the solitude of his village and have consider in every aspect " the point be do not you see that progress of every sort be only make by the use of authority " he say evidently wish to show he be not without culture " take the reform of peter of catherine of alexander take european history and progress in agriculture more than anything else — the potato for instance that be introduce among we by force the wooden plough too be not always use it be introduce maybe in the day before the empire but it be probably bring in by force now in our own day we landowner in the serf time use various improvement in our husbandry drying machine and thrashing machine and cart manure and all the modern implement — all that we bring into use by our authority and the peasant oppose it at first and end by imitate we now by the abolition of serfdom we have be deprive of our authority and so our husbandry where it have be raise to a high level be bind to sink to the most savage primitive condition that ’ how I see it " " but why so if it ’ rational you ’ll be able to keep up the same system with hire labor " say sviazhsky " we ’ve no power over they with whom be I go to work the system allow I to ask " " there it be — the labor force — the chief element in agriculture " think levin " with laborer " " the laborer will not work well and will not work with good implement our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig and when he ’ drunk he ruin everything you give he he make the horse ill with too much water cut good harness barter the tire of the wheel for drink drop bit of iron into the thrash machine so as to break it he loathe the sight of anything that ’ not after his fashion and that ’ how it be the whole level of husbandry have fall land go out of cultivation overgrown with weed or divide among the peasant and where million of bushel be raise you get a hundred thousand the wealth of the country have decrease if the same thing have be do but with care that " and he proceed to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by mean of which these drawback might have be avoid this do not interest levin but when he have finish levin go back to his first position and address sviazhsky and try to draw he into express his serious opinion — " that the standard of culture be fall and that with our present relation to the peasant there be no possibility of farm on a rational system to yield a profit — that ’ perfectly true " say he " I do not believe it " sviazhsky reply quite seriously " all I see be that we do not know how to cultivate the land and that our system of agriculture in the serf day be by no mean too high but too low we have no machine no good stock no efficient supervision we do not even know how to keep account ask any landowner he will not be able to tell you what crop ’ profitable and what ’ not " " italian bookkeeping " say the gentleman of the gray whisker ironically " you may keep your book as you like but if they spoil everything for you there will not be any profit " " why do they spoil thing a poor thrash machine or your russian presser they will break but my steam press they do not break a wretched russian nag they ’ll ruin but keep good drayhorse — they will not ruin they and so it be all round we must raise our farming to a high level " " oh if one only have the mean to do it nikolay ivanovitch it ’ all very well for you but for I with a son to keep at the university lad to be educate at the high school — how be I go to buy these drayhorse " " well that ’ what the land bank be for " " to get what ’ leave I sell by auction no thank you " " I do not agree that it ’ necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still high " say levin " I devote myself to it and I have mean but I can do nothing as to the bank I do not know to whom they ’re any good for my part anyway whatever I ’ve spend money on in the way of husbandry it have be a loss stock — a loss machinery — a loss " " that ’ true enough " the gentleman with the gray whisker chime in positively laugh with satisfaction " and I ’m not the only one " pursue levin " I mix with all the neighbor landowner who be cultivate their land on a rational system you all with rare exception be do so at a loss come tell we how do your land do — do it pay " say levin and at once in sviazhsky ’s eye he detect that fleeting expression of alarm which he have notice whenever he have try to penetrate beyond the outer chamber of sviazhsky ’s mind moreover this question on levin ’s part be not quite in good faith madame sviazhskaya have just tell he at tea that they have that summer invite a german expert in bookkeeping from moscow who for a consideration of five hundred rouble have investigate the management of their property and find that it be cost they a loss of three thousand odd rouble she do not remember the precise sum but it appear that the german have work it out to the fraction of a farthing the graywhiskered landowner smile at the mention of the profit of sviazhsky ’s famle obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal be likely to be make " possibly it do not pay " answer sviazhsky " that merely prove either that I ’m a bad manager or that I ’ve sink my capital for the increase of my rent " " oh rent " levin cry with horror " rent there may be in europe where land have be improve by the labor put into it but with we all the land be deteriorate from the labor put into it — in other word they ’re work it out so there ’ no question of rent " " how no rent it ’ a law " " then we ’re outside the law rent explain nothing for we but simply muddle we no tell I how there can be a theory of rent " " will you have some junket masha pass we some junket or raspberry " he turn to his wife " extraordinarily late the raspberry be last this year " and in the happy frame of mind sviazhsky get up and walk off apparently suppose the conversation to have end at the very point when to levin it seem that it be only just begin have lose his antagonist levin continue the conversation with the graywhiskered landowner try to prove to he that all the difficulty arise from the fact that we do not find out the peculiarity and habit of our laborer but the landowner like all man who think independently and in isolation be slow in take in any other person ’s idea and particularly partial to his own he stick to it that the russian peasant be a swine and like swinishness and that to get he out of his swinishness one must have authority and there be none one must have the stick and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replace the stick that serve we for a thousand year by lawyer and model prison where the worthless stinking peasant be feed on good soup and have a fix allowance of cubic foot of air " what make you think " say levin try to get back to the question " that it ’ impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive " " that never could be so with the russian peasantry we ’ve no power over they " answer the landowner " how can new condition be find " say sviazhsky have eat some junket and light a cigarette he come back to the discussion " all possible relation to the labor force have be define and study " he say " the relic of barbarism the primitive commune with each guarantee for all will disappear of itself serfdom have be abolish — there remain nothing but free labor and its form be fix and ready make and must be adopt permanent hand daylaborer rammer — you can not get out of those form " " but europe be dissatisfied with these form " " dissatisfied and seek new one and will find they in all probability " " that ’ just what I be mean " answer levin " why should not we seek they for ourselves " " because it would be just like invent afresh the mean for construct railway they be ready invent " " but if they do not do for we if they ’re stupid " say levin and again he detect the expression of alarm in the eye of sviazhsky " oh yes we ’ll bury the world under our cap we ’ve find the secret europe be seek for I ’ve hear all that but excuse I do you know all that ’ be do in europe on the question of the organization of labor " " no very little " " that question be now absorb the good mind in europe the schulzedelitsch movement and then all this enormous literature of the labor question the most liberal lassalle movement   the mulhausen experiment that ’ a fact by now as you ’re probably aware " " I have some idea of it but very vague " " no you only say that no doubt you know all about it as well as I do I ’m not a professor of sociology of course but it interest I and really if it interest you you ought to study it " " but what conclusion have they come to " " excuse I " the two neighbor have rise and sviazhsky once more check levin in his inconvenient habit of peep into what be beyond the outer chamber of his mind go to see his guest out levin be insufferably bored that evening with the lady he be stir as he have never be before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he be feel with his system of manage his land be not an exceptional case but the general condition of thing in russia that the organization of some relation of the laborer to the soil in which they would work as with the peasant he have meet halfway to the sviazhskys ' be not a dream but a problem which must be solve and it seem to he that the problem could be solve and that he ought to try and solve it after say goodnight to the lady and promise to stay the whole of the next day so as to make an expedition on horseback with they to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest levin go before go to bed into his host ’s study to get the book on the labor question that sviazhsky have offer he sviazhsky ’s study be a huge room surround by bookcase and with two table in it — one a massive writingtable stand in the middle of the room and the other a round table cover with recent number of review and journal in different language range like the ray of a star round the lamp on the writingtable be a stand of drawer mark with gold lettering and full of paper of various sort sviazhsky take out the book and sit down in a rockingchair " what be you look at there " he say to levin who be stand at the round table look through the review " oh yes there ’ a very interesting article here " say sviazhsky of the review levin be hold in his hand " it appear " he go on with eager interest " that friedrich be not after all the person chiefly responsible for the partition of poland it be prove " and with his characteristic clearness he sum up those new very important and interesting revelation although levin be engross at the moment by his idea about the problem of the land he wonder as he hear sviazhsky " what be there inside of he and why why be he interested in the partition of poland " when sviazhsky have finish levin could not help ask " well and what then " but there be nothing to follow it be simply interesting that it have be prove to be so and so but sviazhsky do not explain and see no need to explain why it be interesting to he " yes but I be very much interested by your irritable neighbor " say levin sigh " he ’ a clever fellow and say a lot that be true " " oh get along with you an inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart like all of they " say sviazhsky " whose marshal you be " " yes only I marshal they in the other direction " say sviazhsky laugh " I ’ll tell you what interest I very much " say levin " he ’ right that our system that ’ to say of rational farming do not answer that the only thing that answer be the moneylender system like that meeklooking gentleman ’s or else the very simple whose fault be it " " our own of course besides it ’ not true that it do not answer it answer with vassiltchikov " " a factory " " but I really do not know what it be you be surprised at the people be at such a low stage of rational and moral development that it ’ obvious they ’re bind to oppose everything that ’ strange to they in europe a rational system answer because the people be educate it follow that we must educate the people — that ’ all " " but how be we to educate the people " " to educate the people three thing be need school and school and school " " but you say yourself the people be at such a low stage of material development what help be school for that " " do you know you remind I of the story of the advice give to the sick man — you should try purgative medicine take worse try leech try they worse well then there ’ nothing leave but to pray to god try it bad that ’ just how it be with we I say political economy you say — bad I say socialism bad education bad " " but how do school help matter " " they give the peasant fresh want " " well that ’ a thing I ’ve never understand " levin reply with heat " in what way be school go to help the people to improve their material position you say school education will give they fresh want so much the bad since they will not be capable of satisfy they and in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism be go to improve their material condition I never could make out the day before yesterday I meet a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby and ask she where she be go she say she be go to the wise woman her boy have screaming fit so she be take he to be doctor I ask ' why how do the wise woman cure screaming fit ' ' she put the child on the henroost and repeat some charm ' " " well you ’re say it yourself what ’ want to prevent she take her child to the henroost to cure it of screaming fit be just " sviazhsky say smile goodhumoredly " oh no " say levin with annoyance " that method of doctoring I merely mean as a simile for doctor the people with school the people be poor and ignorant — that we see as surely as the peasant woman see the baby be ill because it scream but in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance be to be cure by school be as incomprehensible as how the henroost affect the screaming what have to be cure be what make he poor " " well in that at least you ’re in agreement with spencer whom you dislike so much he say too that education may be the consequence of great prosperity and comfort of more frequent washing as he say but not of be able to read and write " " well then I ’m very glad — or the contrary very sorry that I ’m in agreement with spencer only I ’ve know it a long while school can do no good what will do good be an economic organization in which the people will become rich will have more leisure — and then there will be school " " still all over europe now school be obligatory " " and how far do you agree with spencer yourself about it " ask levin but there be a gleam of alarm in sviazhsky ’s eye and he say smile " no that scream story be positively capital do you really hear it yourself " levin see that he be not to discover the connection between this man ’s life and his thought obviously he do not care in the least what his reasoning lead he to all he want be the process of reasoning and he do not like it when the process of reasoning bring he into a blind alley that be the only thing he dislike and avoid by change the conversation to something agreeable and amusing all the impression of the day begin with the impression make by the old peasant which serve as it be as the fundamental basis of all the conception and idea of the day throw levin into violent excitement this dear good sviazhsky keep a stock of idea simply for social purpose and obviously have some other principle hide from levin while with the crowd whose name be legion he guide public opinion by idea he do not share that irascible country gentleman perfectly correct in the conclusion that he have be worry into by life but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class and that the good class in russia his own dissatisfaction with the work he have be do and the vague hope of find a remedy for all this — all be blend in a sense of inward turmoil and anticipation of some solution near at hand leave alone in the room assign he lie on a spring mattress that yield unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg levin do not fall asleep for a long while not one conversation with sviazhsky though he have say a great deal that be clever have interest levin but the conclusion of the irascible landowner require consideration levin could not help recall every word he have say and in imagination amend his own reply " yes I ought to have say to he you say that our husbandry do not answer because the peasant hate improvement and that they must be force on he by authority if no system of husbandry answer at all without these improvement you would be quite right but the only system that do answer be where laborer be work in accordance with his habit just as on the old peasant ’s land halfway here your and our general dissatisfaction with the system show that either we be to blame or the laborer we have go our way — the european way — a long while without ask ourselves about the quality of our labor force let we try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force but as the russian peasant with his instinct and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that imagine I ought to have say to he that you have the same system as the old peasant have that you have find mean of make your laborer take an interest in the success of the work and have find the happy mean in the way of improvement which they will admit and you will without exhaust the soil get twice or three time the yield you get before divide it in half give half as the share of labor the surplus leave you will be great and the share of labor will be great too and to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborer in its success how to do this — that ’ a matter of detail but undoubtedly it can be do " this idea throw levin into a great excitement he do not sleep half the night think over in detail the putting of his idea into practice he have not intend to go away next day but he now determine to go home early in the morning besides the sisterinlaw with her lownecked bodice arouse in he a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action most important of all — he must get back without delay he would have to make haste to put his new project to the peasant before the sowing of the winter wheat so that the sowing might be undertake on a new basis he have make up his mind to revolutionize his whole system the carrying out of levin ’s plan present many difficulty but he struggle on do his utmost and attain a result which though not what he desire be enough to enable he without selfdeception to believe that the attempt be worth the trouble one of the chief difficulty be that the process of cultivate the land be in full swing that it be impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning and the machine have to be mend while in motion when on the evening that he arrive home he inform the bailiff of his plan the latter with visible pleasure agree with what he say so long as he be point out that all that have be do up to that time be stupid and useless the bailiff say that he have say so a long while ago but no heed have be pay he but as for the proposal make by levin — to take a part as shareholder with his laborer in each agricultural undertaking — at this the bailiff simply express a profound despondency and offer no definite opinion but begin immediately talk of the urgent necessity of carry the remain sheaf of rye the next day and of send the man out for the second ploughing so that levin feel that this be not the time for discuss it on begin to talk to the peasant about it and make a proposition to cede they the land on new term he come into collision with the same great difficulty that they be so much absorb by the current work of the day that they have not time to consider the advantage and disadvantage of the propose scheme the simplehearted ivan the cowherd seem completely to grasp levin ’s proposal — that he should with his family take a share of the profit of the cattleyard — and he be in complete sympathy with the plan but when levin hint at the future advantage ivan ’s face express alarm and regret that he could not hear all he have to say and he make haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay he either snatch up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pen or run to get water or to clear out the dung another difficulty lie in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a landowner ’s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of they they be firmly convinced that his real aim whatever he might say to they would always be in what he do not say to they and they themselves in give their opinion say a great deal but never say what be their real object moreover levin feel that the irascible landowner have be right the peasant make their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be force to any new method of tillage of any kind nor to use new implement they agree that the modern plough plough well that the scarifier do the work more quickly but they find thousand of reason that make it out of the question for they to use either of they and though he have accept the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation he feel sorry to give up improve method the advantage of which be so obvious but in spite of all these difficulty he get his way and by autumn the system be work or at least so it seem to he at first levin have think of give up the whole farming of the land just as it be to the peasant the laborer and the bailiff on new condition of partnership but he be very soon convinced that this be impossible and determined to divide it up the cattleyard the garden hay field and arable land divide into several part have to be make into separate lot the simplehearted cowherd ivan who levin fancy understand the matter well than any of they collect together a gang of worker to help he principally of his own family become a partner in the cattleyard a distant part of the estate a tract of waste land that have lie fallow for eight year be with the help of the clever carpenter fyodor ryezunov take by six family of peasant on new condition of partnership and the peasant shuraev take the management of all the vegetable garden on the same term the remainder of the land be still work on the old system but these three associate partnership be the first step to a new organization of the whole and they completely take up levin ’s time it be true that in the cattleyard thing go no well than before and ivan strenuously oppose warm housing for the cow and butter make of fresh cream affirm that cow require less food if keep cold and that butter be more profitable make from sour cream and he ask for wage just as under the old system and take not the slight interest in the fact that the money he receive be not wage but an advance out of his future share in the profit it be true that fyodor ryezunov ’s company do not plough over the ground twice before sow as have be agree justify themselves on the plea that the time be too short it be true that the peasant of the same company though they have agree to work the land on new condition always speak of the land not as hold in partnership but as rent for half the crop and more than once the peasant and ryezunov himself say to levin " if you would take a rent for the land it would save you trouble and we should be more free " moreover the same peasant keep put off on various excuse the building of a cattleyard and barn on the land as agree upon and delay do it till the winter it be true that shuraev would have like to let out the kitchen garden he have undertake in small lot to the peasant he evidently quite misunderstand and apparently intentionally misunderstand the condition upon which the land have be give to he often too talk to the peasant and explain to they all the advantage of the plan levin feel that the peasant hear nothing but the sound of his voice and be firmly resolved whatever he might say not to let themselves be take in he feel this especially when he talk to the clever of the peasant ryezunov and detect the gleam in ryezunov ’s eye which show so plainly both ironical amusement at levin and the firm conviction that if anyone be to be take in it would not be he ryezunov but in spite of all this levin think the system work and that by keep account strictly and insist on his own way he would prove to they in the future the advantage of the arrangement and then the system would go of itself these matter together with the management of the land still leave on his hand and the indoor work over his book so engross levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever go out shoot at the end of august he hear that the oblonskys have go away to moscow from their servant who bring back the sidesaddle he feel that in not answer darya alexandrovna ’s letter he have by his rudeness of which he could not think without a flush of shame burn his ship and that he would never go and see they again he have be just as rude with the sviazhskys leave they without say goodbye but he would never go to see they again either he do not care about that now the business of reorganize the farming of his land absorb he as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life he read the book lend he by sviazhsky and copy out what he have not get he read both the economic and socialistic book on the subject but as he have anticipate find nothing bear on the scheme he have undertake in the book on political economy — in mill for instance whom he study first with great ardor hope every minute to find an answer to the question that be engross he — he find law deduce from the condition of land culture in europe but he do not see why these law which do not apply in russia must be general he see just the same thing in the socialistic book either they be the beautiful but impracticable fantasy which have fascinate he when he be a student or they be attempt at improve rectify the economic position in which europe be place with which the system of land tenure in russia have nothing in common political economy tell he that the law by which the wealth of europe have be develop and be develop be universal and unvarying socialism tell he that development along these line lead to ruin and neither of they give an answer or even a hint in reply to the question what he levin and all the russian peasant and landowner be to do with their million of hand and million of acre to make they as productive as possible for the common weal have once take the subject up he read conscientiously everything bear on it and intend in the autumn to go abroad to study land system on the spot in order that he might not on this question be confront with what so often meet he on various subject often just as he be begin to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he be talk to and be begin to explain his own he would suddenly be tell " but kauffmann but jones but dubois but michelli you have not read they they ’ve thrash that question out thoroughly " he see now distinctly that kauffmann and michelli have nothing to tell he he know what he want he see that russia have splendid land splendid laborer and that in certain case as at the peasant ’s on the way to sviazhsky ’s the produce raise by the laborer and the land be great — in the majority of case when capital be apply in the european way the produce be small and that this simply arise from the fact that the laborer want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way and that this antagonism be not incidental but invariable and have its root in the national spirit he think that the russian people whose task it be to colonize and cultivate vast tract of unoccupied land consciously adhere till all their land be occupy to the method suitable to their purpose and that their method be by no mean so bad as be generally suppose and he want to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land at the end of september the timber have be cart for build the cattleyard on the land that have be allot to the association of peasant and the butter from the cow be sell and the profit divide in practice the system work capitally or at least so it seem to levin in order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book which in levin ’s daydream be not merely to effect a revolution in political economy but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil all that be leave to do be to make a tour abroad and to study on the spot all that have be do in the same direction and to collect conclusive evidence that all that have be do there be not what be want levin be only wait for the delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad but the rain begin prevent the harvesting of the corn and potato leave in the field and put a stop to all work even to the delivery of the wheat the mud be impassable along the road two mill be carry away and the weather get bad and bad on the 30th of september the sun come out in the morning and hope for fine weather levin begin make final preparation for his journey he give order for the wheat to be deliver send the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owe he and go out himself to give some final direction on the estate before set off have finish all his business soak through with the stream of water which keep run down the leather behind his neck and his gaiter but in the keen and most confident temper levin return homewards in the evening the weather have become bad than ever towards evening the hail lash the drench mare so cruelly that she go along sideways shake her head and ear but levin be all right under his hood and he look cheerfully about he at the muddy stream run under the wheel at the drop hang on every bare twig at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstone on the plank of the bridge at the thick layer of still juicy fleshy leave that lie heap up about the stripped elmtree in spite of the gloominess of nature around he he feel peculiarly eager the talk he have be have with the peasant in the further village have show that they be begin to get used to their new position the old servant to whose hut he have go to get dry evidently approve of levin ’s plan and of his own accord propose to enter the partnership by the purchase of cattle " I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim and I shall attain my end " think levin " and it ’ something to work and take trouble for this be not a matter of myself individually the question of the public welfare come into it the whole system of culture the chief element in the condition of the people must be completely transform instead of poverty general prosperity and content instead of hostility harmony and unity of interest in short a bloodless revolution but a revolution of the great magnitude begin in the little circle of our district then the province then russia the whole world because a just idea can not but be fruitful yes it ’ an aim worth work for and its be I kostya levin who go to a ball in a black tie and be refuse by the shtcherbatskaya girl and who be intrinsically such a pitiful worthless creature — that prove nothing I feel sure franklin feel just as worthless and he too have no faith in himself think of himself as a whole that mean nothing and he too most likely have an agafea mihalovna to whom he confide his secret " muse on such thought levin reach home in the darkness the bailiff who have be to the merchant have come back and bring part of the money for the wheat an agreement have be make with the old servant and on the road the bailiff have learn that everywhere the corn be still stand in the field so that his one hundred and sixty shock that have not be carry be nothing in comparison with the loss of other after dinner levin be sit as he usually do in an easy chair with a book and as he read he go on think of the journey before he in connection with his book you all the significance of his book rise before he with special distinctness and whole period range themselves in his mind in illustration of his theory " I must write that down " he think " that ought to form a brief introduction which I think unnecessary before " he get up to go to his writingtable and laska lie at his foot get up too stretch and look at he as though to inquire where to go but he have not time to write it down for the head peasant have come round and levin go out into the hall to they after his levee that be to say give direction about the labor of the next day and see all the peasant who have business with he levin go back to his study and sit down to work laska lie under the table agafea mihalovna settle herself in her place with her stocking after write for a little while levin suddenly think with exceptional vividness of kitty her refusal and their last meeting he get up and begin walk about the room " what ’ the use of be dreary " say agafea mihalovna " come why do you stay on at home you ought to go to some warm spring especially now you ’re ready for the journey " " well I be go away the day after tomorrow agafea mihalovna I must finish my work " " there there your work you say as if you have not do enough for the peasant why as ' ti they ’re say ' your master will be get some honor from the tsar for it ' indeed and it be a strange thing why need you worry about the peasant " " I ’m not worry about they I ’m do it for my own good " agafea mihalovna know every detail of levin ’s plan for his land levin often put his view before she in all their complexity and not uncommonly he argue with she and do not agree with her comment but on this occasion she entirely misinterpret what he have say " of one ’s soul ’s salvation we all know and must think before all else " she say with a sigh " parfen denisitch now for all he be no scholar he die a death that god grant everyone of we the like " she say refer to a servant who have die recently " take the sacrament and all " " that ’ not what I mean " say he " I mean that I ’m act for my own advantage it ’ all the well for I if the peasant do their work well " " well whatever you do if he ’ a lazy goodfornought everything’ll be at six and seven if he have a conscience he ’ll work and if not there ’ no do anything " " oh come you say yourself ivan have begin look after the cattle well " " all I say be " answer agafea mihalovna evidently not speak at random but in strict sequence of idea " that you ought to get marry that ’ what I say " agafea mihalovna ’s allusion to the very subject he have only just be think about hurt and sting he levin scowl and without answer she he sit down again to his work repeat to himself all that he have be think of the real significance of that work only at interval he listen in the stillness to the click of agafea mihalovna ’s needle and recollect what he do not want to remember he frown again at nine o’clock they hear the bell and the faint vibration of a carriage over the mud " well here ’s visitor come to we and you will not be dull " say agafea mihalovna get up and go to the door but levin overtake she his work be not go well now and he be glad of a visitor whoever it might be run halfway down the staircase levin catch a sound he know a familiar cough in the hall but he hear it indistinctly through the sound of his own footstep and hope he be mistaken then he catch sight of a long bony familiar figure and now it seem there be no possibility of mistake and yet he still go on hope that this tall man take off his fur cloak and cough be not his brother nikolay levin love his brother but be with he be always a torture just now when levin under the influence of the thought that have come to he and agafea mihalovna ’s hint be in a troubled and uncertain humor the meeting with his brother that he have to face seem particularly difficult instead of a lively healthy visitor some outsider who would he hope cheer he up in his uncertain humor he have to see his brother who know he through and through who would call forth all the thought near his heart would force he to show himself fully and that he be not disposed to do angry with himself for so base a feeling levin run into the hall as soon as he have see his brother close this feeling of selfish disappointment vanish instantly and be replace by pity terrible as his brother nikolay have be before in his emaciation and sickliness now he look still more emaciated still more wasted he be a skeleton cover with skin he stand in the hall jerk his long thin neck and pull the scarf off it and smile a strange and pitiful smile when he see that smile submissive and humble levin feel something clutch at his throat " you see I ’ve come to you " say nikolay in a thick voice never for one second take his eye off his brother ’s face " I ’ve be mean to a long while but I ’ve be unwell all the time now I ’m ever so much well " he say rub his beard with his big thin hand " yes yes " answer levin and he feel still more frightened when kiss he he feel with his lip the dryness of his brother ’s skin and see close to he his big eye full of a strange light a few week before konstantin levin have write to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property that have remain undivided there be a sum of about two thousand rouble to come to he as his share nikolay say that he have come now to take this money and what be more important to stay a while in the old nest to get in touch with the earth so as to renew his strength like the hero of old for the work that lie before he in spite of his exaggerated stoop and the emaciation that be so striking from his height his movement be as rapid and abrupt as ever levin lead he into his study his brother dress with particular care — a thing he never use to do — comb his scanty lank hair and smile go upstairs he be in the most affectionate and goodhumored mood just as levin often remember he in childhood he even refer to sergey ivanovitch without rancor when he see agafea mihalovna he make joke with she and ask after the old servant the news of the death of parfen denisitch make a painful impression on he a look of fear cross his face but he regain his serenity immediately " of course he be quite old " he say and change the subject " well I ’ll spend a month or two with you and then I ’m off to moscow do you know myakov have promise I a place there and I ’m go into the service now I ’m go to arrange my life quite differently " he go on " you know I get rid of that woman " " marya nikolaevna why what for " " oh she be a horrid woman she cause I all sort of worry " but he do not say what the annoyance be he could not say that he have cast off marya nikolaevna because the tea be weak and above all because she would look after he as though he be an invalid " besides I want to turn over a new leaf completely now I ’ve do silly thing of course like everyone else but money ’ the last consideration I do not regret it so long as there ’ health and my health thank god be quite restore " levin listen and rack his brain but could think of nothing to say nikolay probably feel the same he begin question his brother about his affair and levin be glad to talk about himself because then he could speak without hypocrisy he tell his brother of his plan and his doing his brother listen but evidently he be not interested by it these two man be so akin so near each other that the slight gesture the tone of voice tell both more than could be say in word both of they now have only one thought — the illness of nikolay and the nearness of his death — which stifle all else but neither of they dare to speak of it and so whatever they say — not utter the one thought that fill their mind — be all falsehood never have levin be so glad when the evening be over and it be time to go to bed never with any outside person never on any official visit have he be so unnatural and false as he be that evening and the consciousness of this unnaturalness and the remorse he feel at it make he even more unnatural he want to weep over his die dearly love brother and he have to listen and keep on talk of how he mean to live as the house be damp and only one bedroom have be keep heated levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen his brother get into bed and whether he sleep or do not sleep toss about like a sick man cough and when he could not get his throat clear mumble something sometimes when his breathing be painful he say " oh my god " sometimes when he be choke he mutter angrily " ah the devil " levin could not sleep for a long while hear he his thought be of the most various but the end of all his thought be the same — death death the inevitable end of all for the first time present itself to he with irresistible force and death which be here in this love brother groan half asleep and from habit call without distinction on god and the devil be not so remote as it have hitherto seem to he it be in himself too he feel that if not today tomorrow if not tomorrow in thirty year be not it all the same and what be this inevitable death — he do not know have never think about it and what be more have not the power have not the courage to think about it " I work I want to do something but I have forget it must all end I have forget — death " he sit on his bed in the darkness crouch up hug his knee and hold his breath from the strain of thought he ponder but the more intensely he think the clear it become to he that it be indubitably so that in reality look upon life he have forget one little fact — that death will come and all end that nothing be even worth begin and that there be no help it anyway yes it be awful but it be so " but I be alive still now what ’ to be do what ’ to be do " he say in despair he light a candle get up cautiously and go to the lookingglass and begin look at his face and hair yes there be gray hair about his temple he open his mouth his back tooth be begin to decay he bare his muscular arm yes there be strength in they but nikolay who lie there breathe with what be leave of lung have have a strong healthy body too and suddenly he recall how they use to go to bed together as child and how they only wait till fyodor bogdanitch be out of the room to fling pillow at each other and laugh laugh irrepressibly so that even their awe of fyodor bogdanitch could not check the effervescing overbrimming sense of life and happiness " and now that bent hollow chest   and I not know what will become of I or wherefore " " kha kha damnation why do you keep fidget why do not you go to sleep " his brother ’s voice call to he " oh I do not know I ’m not sleepy " " I have have a good sleep I ’m not in a sweat now just see feel my shirt it ’ not wet be it " levin felt withdraw behind the screen and put out the candle but for a long while he could not sleep the question how to live have hardly begin to grow a little clear to he when a new insoluble question present itself — death " why he ’ die — yes he ’ll die in the spring and how help he what can I say to he what do I know about it I ’d even forget that it be at all " levin have long before make the observation that when one be uncomfortable with people from their be excessively amenable and meek one be apt very soon after to find thing intolerable from their touchiness and irritability he feel that this be how it would be with his brother and his brother nikolay ’s gentleness do in fact not last out for long the very next morning he begin to be irritable and seem do his good to find fault with his brother attack he on his tender point levin feel himself to blame and could not set thing right he feel that if they have both not keep up appearance but have speak as it be call from the heart — that be to say have say only just what they be think and feel — they would simply have look into each other ’s face and konstantin could only have say " you ’re die you ’re die " and nikolay could only have answer " I know I ’m die but I ’m afraid I ’m afraid I ’m afraid " and they could have say nothing more if they have say only what be in their heart but life like that be impossible and so konstantin try to do what he have be try to do all his life and never could learn to do though as far as he could observe many people know so well how to do it and without it there be no living at all he try to say what he be not think but he feel continually that it have a ring of falsehood that his brother detect he in it and be exasperate at it the third day nikolay induce his brother to explain his plan to he again and begin not merely attack it but intentionally confound it with communism " you ’ve simply borrow an idea that ’ not your own but you ’ve distort it and be try to apply it where it ’ not applicable " " but I tell you it ’ nothing to do with it they deny the justice of property of capital of inheritance while I do not deny this chief stimulus " levin feel disgust himself at use such expression but ever since he have be engross by his work he have unconsciously come more and more frequently to use word not russian " all I want be to regulate labor " " which mean you ’ve borrow an idea strip it of all that give it its force and want to make believe that it ’ something new " say nikolay angrily tug at his necktie " but my idea have nothing in common " " that anyway " say nikolay levin with an ironical smile his eye flash malignantly " have the charm of — what ’ one to call it — geometrical symmetry of clearness of definiteness it may be a utopia but if once one allow the possibility of make of all the past a tabula rasa — no property no family — then labor would organize itself but you gain nothing " " why do you mix thing up I ’ve never be a communist " " but I have and I consider it ’ premature but rational and it have a future just like christianity in its first age " " all that I maintain be that the labor force ought to be investigate from the point of view of natural science that be to say it ought to be study its quality ascertain " " but that ’ utter waste of time that force find a certain form of activity of itself accord to the stage of its development there have be slave first everywhere then metayers and we have the halfcrop system rent and day laborer what be you try to find " levin suddenly lose his temper at these word because at the bottom of his heart he be afraid that it be true — true that he be try to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar form and that this be hardly possible " I be try to find mean of work productively for myself and for the laborer I want to organize " he answer hotly " you do not want to organize anything it ’ simply just as you ’ve be all your life that you want to be original to pose as not exploit the peasant simply but with some idea in view " " oh all right that ’ what you think — and let I alone " answer levin feel the muscle of his left cheek twitch uncontrollably " you ’ve never have and never have conviction all you want be to please your vanity " " oh very well then let I alone " " and I will let you alone and it ’ high time I do and go to the devil with you and I ’m very sorry I ever come " in spite of all levin ’s effort to soothe his brother afterwards nikolay would listen to nothing he say declare that it be well to part and konstantin see that it simply be that life be unbearable to he nikolay be just get ready to go when konstantin go in to he again and beg he rather unnaturally to forgive he if he have hurt his feeling in any way " ah generosity " say nikolay and he smile " if you want to be right I can give you that satisfaction you ’re in the right but I ’m go all the same " it be only just at parting that nikolay kiss he and say look with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother " anyway do not remember evil against I kostya " and his voice quiver these be the only word that have be speak sincerely between they levin know that those word mean " you see and you know that I ’m in a bad way and maybe we shall not see each other again " levin know this and the tear gush from his eye he kiss his brother once more but he could not speak and know not what to say three day after his brother ’s departure levin too set off for his foreign tour happen to meet shtcherbatsky kitty ’s cousin in the railway train levin greatly astonish he by his depression " what ’ the matter with you " shtcherbatsky ask he " oh nothing there ’ not much happiness in life " " not much you come with I to paris instead of to mulhausen you shall see how to be happy " " no I ’ve do with it all it ’ time I be dead " " well that ’ a good one " say shtcherbatsky laugh " why I ’m only just get ready to begin " " yes I think the same not long ago but now I know I shall soon be dead " levin say what he have genuinely be think of late he see nothing but death or the advance towards death in everything but his cherish scheme only engross he the more life have to be get through somehow till death do come darkness have fall upon everything for he but just because of this darkness he feel that the one guide clue in the darkness be his work and he clutch it and cling to it with all his strength the karenins husband and wife continue live in the same house meet every day but be complete stranger to one another alexey alexandrovitch make it a rule to see his wife every day so that the servant might have no ground for supposition but avoid dine at home vronsky be never at alexey alexandrovitch ’s house but anna see he away from home and her husband be aware of it the position be one of misery for all three and not one of they would have be equal to endure this position for a single day if it have not be for the expectation that it would change that it be merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over alexey alexandrovitch hope that this passion would pass as everything do pass that everyone would forget about it and his name would remain unsullied anna on whom the position depend and for whom it be more miserable than for anyone endure it because she not merely hope but firmly believe that it would all very soon be settle and come right she have not the least idea what would settle the position but she firmly believe that something would very soon turn up now vronsky against his own will or wish follow her lead hope too that something apart from his own action would be sure to solve all difficulty in the middle of the winter vronsky spend a very tiresome week a foreign prince who have come on a visit to petersburg be put under his charge and he have to show he the sight worth see vronsky be of distinguished appearance he possess moreover the art of behave with respectful dignity and be used to have to do with such grand personage — that be how he come to be put in charge of the prince but he feel his duty very irksome the prince be anxious to miss nothing of which he would be ask at home have he see that in russia and on his own account he be anxious to enjoy to the utmost all russian form of amusement vronsky be oblige to be his guide in satisfy both these inclination the morning they spend drive to look at place of interest the evening they pass enjoy the national entertainment the prince rejoice in health exceptional even among prince by gymnastic and careful attention to his health he have bring himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure he look as fresh as a big glossy green dutch cucumber the prince have travel a great deal and consider one of the chief advantage of modern facility of communication be the accessibility of the pleasure of all nation he have be in spain and there have indulge in serenade and have make friend with a spanish girl who play the mandolin in switzerland he have kill chamois in england he have gallop in a red coat over hedge and kill two hundred pheasant for a bet in turkey he have get into a harem in india he have hunt on an elephant and now in russia he wish to taste all the specially russian form of pleasure vronsky who be as it be chief master of the ceremony to he be at great pain to arrange all the russian amusement suggest by various person to the prince they have race horse and russian pancake and bear hunt and threehorse sledge and gypsy and drinking feast with the russian accompaniment of broken crockery and the prince with surprising ease fall in with the russian spirit smash tray full of crockery sit with a gypsy girl on his knee and seem to be ask — what more and do the whole russian spirit consist in just this in reality of all the russian entertainment the prince like well french actress and ballet dancer and whiteseal champagne vronsky be use to prince but either because he have himself change of late or that he be in too close proximity to the prince that week seem fearfully wearisome to he the whole of that week he experience a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman afraid of the madman and at the same time from be with he fear for his own reason vronsky be continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relax the tone of stern official respectfulness that he might not himself be insult the prince ’s manner of treat the very people who to vronsky ’s surprise be ready to descend to any depth to provide he with russian amusement be contemptuous his criticism of russian woman whom he wish to study more than once make vronsky crimson with indignation the chief reason why the prince be so particularly disagreeable to vronsky be that he could not help see himself in he and what he see in this mirror do not gratify his selfesteem he be a very stupid and very selfsatisfied and very healthy and very wellwashed man and nothing else he be a gentleman — that be true and vronsky could not deny it he be equable and not cringe with his superior be free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equal and be contemptuously indulgent with his inferior vronsky be himself the same and regard it as a great merit to be so but for this prince he be an inferior and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to he revolt he " brainless beef can I be like that " he think be that as it might when on the seventh day he part from the prince who be start for moscow and receive his thank he be happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself he say goodbye to he at the station on their return from a bear hunt at which they have have a display of russian prowess keep up all night when he get home vronsky find there a note from anna she write " I be ill and unhappy I can not come out but I can not go on long without see you come in this evening alexey alexandrovitch go to the council at seven and will be there till ten " think for an instant of the strangeness of she bid he come straight to she in spite of her husband ’s insist on she not receive he he decide to go vronsky have that winter get his promotion be now a colonel have leave the regimental quarter and be live alone after have some lunch he lie down on the sofa immediately and in five minute memory of the hideous scene he have witness during the last few day be confuse together and join on to a mental image of anna and of the peasant who have play an important part in the bear hunt and vronsky fall asleep he wake up in the dark tremble with horror and make haste to light a candle " what be it what what be the dreadful thing I dream yes yes I think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard be stoop down do something and all of a sudden he begin say some strange word in french yes there be nothing else in the dream " he say to himself " but why be it so awful " he vividly recall the peasant again and those incomprehensible french word the peasant have utter and a chill of horror run down his spine " what nonsense " think vronsky and glance at his watch it be halfpast eight already he ring up his servant dress in haste and go out onto the step completely forget the dream and only worry at be late as he drive up to the karenins ' entrance he look at his watch and see it be ten minute to nine a high narrow carriage with a pair of gray be stand at the entrance he recognize anna ’s carriage " she be come to I " think vronsky " and well she should I do not like go into that house but no matter I can not hide myself " he think and with that manner peculiar to he from childhood as of a man who have nothing to be ashamed of vronsky get out of his sledge and go to the door the door open and the hallporter with a rug on his arm call the carriage vronsky though he do not usually notice detail notice at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glance at he in the very doorway vronsky almost run up against alexey alexandrovitch the gas jet throw its full light on the bloodless sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat brilliant against the beaver of the coat karenin ’s fixed dull eye be fasten upon vronsky ’s face vronsky bow and alexey alexandrovitch chew his lip lift his hand to his hat and go on vronsky see he without look round get into the carriage pick up the rug and the operaglass at the window and disappear vronsky go into the hall his brow be scowl and his eye gleam with a proud and angry light in they " what a position " he think " if he would fight would stand up for his honor I could act could express my feeling but this weakness or baseness he put I in the position of play false which I never mean and never mean to do " vronsky ’s idea have change since the day of his conversation with anna in the vrede garden unconsciously yield to the weakness of anna — who have surrender herself up to he utterly and simply look to he to decide her fate ready to submit to anything — he have long cease to think that their tie might end as he have think then his ambitious plan have retreat into the background again and feel that he have get out of that circle of activity in which everything be definite he have give himself entirely to his passion and that passion be bind he more and more closely to she he be still in the hall when he catch the sound of her retreat footstep he know she have be expect he have listen for he and be now go back to the drawingroom " no " she cry on see he and at the first sound of her voice the tear come into her eye " no if thing be to go on like this the end will come much much too soon " " what be it dear one " " what I ’ve be wait in agony for an hour two hour   no I will not   I can not quarrel with you of course you could not come no I will not " she lay her two hand on his shoulder and look a long while at he with a profound passionate and at the same time search look she be study his face to make up for the time she have not see he she be every time she see he make the picture of he in her imagination incomparably superior impossible in reality fit with he as he really be " you meet he " she ask when they have sit down at the table in the lamplight " you ’re punish you see for be late " " yes but how be it be not he to be at the council " " he have be and come back and be go out somewhere again but that ’ no matter do not talk about it where have you be with the prince still " she know every detail of his existence he be go to say that he have be up all night and have drop asleep but look at her thrilled and rapturous face he be ashamed and he say he have have to go to report on the prince ’s departure " but it ’ over now he be go " " thank god it ’ over you would not believe how insufferable it ’ be for I " " why so be not it the life all of you all young man always lead " she say knit her brow and take up the crochet work that be lie on the table she begin draw the hook out of it without look at vronsky " I give that life up long ago " say he wonder at the change in her face and try to divine its meaning " and I confess " he say with a smile show his thick white tooth " this week I ’ve be as it be look at myself in a glass see that life and I do not like it " she hold the work in her hand but do not crochet and look at he with strange shine and hostile eye " this morning liza come to see I — they’re not afraid to call on I in spite of the countess lidia ivanovna " she put in—“and she tell I about your athenian evening how loathsome " " I be just go to say " she interrupt he " it be that thérèse you use to know " " I be just say " " how disgusting you be you man how be it you can not understand that a woman can never forget that " she say get more and more angry and so let he see the cause of her irritation " especially a woman who can not know your life what do I know what have I ever know " she say " what you tell I and how do I know whether you tell I the truth " " anna you hurt I do not you trust I have not I tell you that I have not a thought I would not lay bare to you " " yes yes " she say evidently try to suppress her jealous thought " but if only you know how wretched I be I believe you I believe you what be you say " but he could not at once recall what he have be go to say these fit of jealousy which of late have be more and more frequent with she horrify he and however much he try to disguise the fact make he feel cold to she although he know the cause of her jealousy be her love for he how often he have tell himself that her love be happiness and now she love he as a woman can love when love have outweigh for she all the good thing of life — and he be much far from happiness

recognition of the inevitability of mistake and the possibility of reform in every department in the new public law court he dislike the restriction lay on the lawyer conduct case but till then he have have nothing to do with the law court and so have disapprove of their publicity simply in theory now his disapprobation be strengthen by the unpleasant impression make on he in the lawyer ’s

mean — that be to be divorce but to do this so that my son may not remain with his mother " the lawyer ’s gray eye try not to laugh but they be dance with irrepressible glee and alexey alexandrovitch see that it be not simply the delight of a man who have just get a profitable job there be triumph and joy there be a gleam like the malignant gleam he see in his wife ’s eye " you desire my assistance in secure a divorce " " yes precisely so but I ought to warn you that I may be waste your time and attention I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step I want a divorce but the form in which it be possible be of great consequence to I it be very possible that if that form do not correspond with my requirement I may give up a legal divorce " " oh that ’ always the case " say the lawyer " and that ’ always for you to decide " he let his eye rest on alexey alexandrovitch ’s foot feel that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement he look at a moth that fly before his nose and move his hand but do not catch it from regard for alexey alexandrovitch ’s position " though in their general feature our law on this subject be know to I " pursue alexey alexandrovitch " I should be glad to have an idea of the form in which such thing be do in practice " " you would be glad " the lawyer without lift his eye respond adopt with a certain satisfaction the tone of his client ’s remark " for I to lay before you all the method by which you could secure what you desire " and on receive an assuring nod from alexey alexandrovitch he go on

the following case wait a little " he call to a clerk who put his head in at the door but he get up all the same say a few word to he and sit down again " in the follow case physical defect in the married parties desertion without communication for five year " he say crook a short finger cover with hair " adultery " this word he pronounce with obvious satisfaction " subdivide as follow " he continue to crook his fat finger though the three case and their subdivision could obviously not be classify together " physical defect of the husband or of the wife adultery of the husband or of the wife " as by now all his finger be use up he uncrooke all his finger and go on " this be the theoretical view but I imagine you have do I the honor to apply to I in order to learn its application in practice and therefore guide by precedent I must inform you that in practice case of divorce you all be reduce to the follow — there ’ no physical defect I may assume nor desertion " alexey alexandrovitch bow his head in assent " — may be reduce to the follow adultery of one of the married party and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement and fail such agreement accidental detection it must be admit that the latter case be rarely meet with in practice " say the lawyer and steal a glance at alexey alexandrovitch he pause as a man sell pistol after enlarge on the advantage of each weapon might await his customer ’s choice but alexey alexandrovitch say nothing and therefore the lawyer go on " the most usual and simple the sensible course I consider be adultery by mutual consent I should not permit myself to express it so speak with a man of no education " he say " but I imagine that to you this be comprehensible " alexey alexandrovitch be however so perturbed that he do not immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent and his eye express this uncertainty but the lawyer promptly come to his assistance " people can not go on live together — here you have a fact and if both be agree about it the detail and formality become a matter of no importance and at the same time this be the simple and most certain method " alexey alexandrovitch fully understand now but he have religious scruple which hinder the execution of such a plan " that be out of the question in the present case " he say " only one alternative be possible undesigned detection support by letter which I have " at the mention of letter the lawyer purse up his lip and give utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound " kindly consider " he begin " case of that kind be as you be aware under ecclesiastical jurisdiction the reverend father be fond of go into the minute detail in case of that kind " he say with a smile which betray his sympathy with the reverend father ' taste " letter may of course be a partial confirmation but detection in the fact there must be of the most direct kind that be by eyewitness in fact if you do I the honor to intrust your confidence to I you will do well to leave I the choice of the measure to be employ if one want the result one must admit the mean " " if it be so " alexey alexandrovitch begin suddenly turn white but at that moment the lawyer rise and again go to the door to speak to the intrude clerk " tell she we do not haggle over fee " he say and return to alexey alexandrovitch on his way back he catch unobserved another moth " nice state my rep curtain will be in by the summer " he think frown " and so you be say " he say " I will communicate my decision to you by letter " say alexey alexandrovitch get up and he clutch at the table after stand a moment in silence he say " from your word I may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtain I would ask you to let I know what be your term " " it may be obtain if you give I complete liberty of action " say the lawyer not answer his question " when can I reckon on receive information from you " he ask move towards the door his eye and his varnished boot shine " in a week ’s time your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case and on what term you will be so good as to communicate to I " " very good " the lawyer bow respectfully let his client out of the door and leave alone give himself up to his sense of amusement he feel so mirthful that contrary to his rule he make a reduction in his term to the haggle lady and give up catch moth finally decide that next winter he must have the furniture cover with velvet like sigonin ’s alexey alexandrovitch have gain a brilliant

certain all such question as for instance of the cause of failure of crop of the adherence of certain tribe to their ancient belief etc — question which but for the convenient intervention of the official machine be not and can not be solve for age — receive full unhesitating solution and this solution be in favor of alexey alexandrovitch ’s contention but stremov who have feel sting to the

old as the hill my boy " " it be old but do you know when you grasp this fully then somehow everything become of no consequence when you understand that you will die tomorrow if not today and nothing will be leave then everything be so unimportant and I consider my idea very important but it turn out really to be as unimportant too even if it be carry out as do for that bear so one go on live

alexandrovitch ’s instigation be not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect and he be glad he have find it in moscow the member of this deputation have not the slight conception of their duty and the part they be to play they naïvely believe that it be their business to lay before the commission their need and the actual condition of thing and to ask assistance of the government and utterly fail to grasp that some of their statement and request support the contention of the enemy ’s side and so spoil the whole business alexey alexandrovitch be busily engage with they for a long while draw up a program for they from which they be not to depart and on dismiss they write a letter to petersburg for the guidance of the deputation he have his chief support in this affair in the countess lidia ivanovna she be a specialist in the matter of deputation and no one know well than she how to manage they and put they in the way they should go have complete this task alexey

not have the effect he anticipate and that it would be unavoidable for he to explain his position and that whatever explanation he might make his relation with his brotherinlaw would remain unchanged " yes I be bring to the painful necessity of seek a divorce " he say " I will say one thing alexey alexandrovitch I know you for an excellent upright man I know anna — excuse I I can not change my opinion of she — for a good an excellent woman and so excuse I I can not believe it there be some misunderstanding " say he " oh if it be merely a misunderstanding " " pardon I understand " interpose stepan arkadyevitch " but of course one thing you must not act in haste you must not you must not act in haste " " I be not act in haste " alexey alexandrovitch say coldly " but one can not ask advice of anyone in such a matter I have quite make up my mind " " this be awful " say stepan arkadyevitch " I would do one thing alexey alexandrovitch I beseech you do it " he say " no action have yet be take if I understand rightly before you take advice see my wife talk to she she love anna like a sister she love you and she ’ a wonderful woman for god ’s sake talk to she do I that favor I beseech

I imagine our relation must change " " why so I do not see that allow I to believe that apart from our connection you have for I at least in part the same friendly feeling I have always have for you   and sincere esteem " say stepan arkadyevitch press his hand " even if your bad supposition be correct I don’t — and never would — take on myself to judge either side and I see no reason why our relation should be affect but now do this come and see my wife " " well we look at the matter differently " say alexey alexandrovitch coldly " however we will not discuss it " " no why should not you come today to dine anyway my wife ’ expect you please do come and above all talk it over with she she ’ a wonderful woman for god ’s sake on my knee I implore you " " if you so much wish it I will

suddenly be promote to so high a position alexey alexandrovitch have previously feel no liking for count anitchkin and have always differ from he in his opinion but now from a feeling readily comprehensible to official — that hatred feel by one who have suffer a defeat in the service for one who have receive a promotion he could not endure he " well have you see he " say alexey alexandrovitch with a malignant smile " of course he be at our sitting yesterday he seem to know his work capitally and to be very energetic " " yes but what be his energy direct to " say alexey alexandrovitch " be he aim at do anything or simply undo what ’ be do it ’ the great misfortune of our government — this paper administration of which he ’ a worthy representative " " really I do not know what fault one could find with he his policy I do not know but one thing — he ’ a very nice fellow " answer stepan arkadyevitch " I ’ve just be see he and he ’ really a capital fellow we lunch together and I teach he how to make you know that drink wine and orange it ’ so cooling and it ’ a wonder he do not know it he like it awfully no really he ’ a capital fellow " stepan arkadyevitch glance at his watch " why good heavens it ’ four already and I ’ve still to go to dolgovushin ’s so please come round to dinner you can not imagine how you will grieve my wife and I " the way in which alexey alexandrovitch see his brotherinlaw out be very different from the manner in which he have meet he " I ’ve promise and I ’ll come " he answer wearily " believe I I appreciate it and I hope you will not regret it " answer stepan arkadyevitch smile and put on his coat as he go he pat the footman on the head chuckle and go out " at five o’clock and not evening dress please " he shout once more turn at the door it be past five and several guest have already arrive before the host himself get home he go in together with sergey ivanovitch koznishev and pestsov who have reach the street door at the same moment these be the two leading representative of the moscow intellectual as oblonsky have call they both be man respect for their character and their intelligence they respect each other but be in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject not because they belong to opposite party but precisely because they be of the same party their enemy refuse to see any distinction between their view but in that party each have his own special shade of opinion and since no difference be less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semiabstract question they never agree in any opinion and have long indeed be accustom to jeer without anger each at the other ’s incorrigible aberration they be just go in at the door talk of the weather when stepan arkadyevitch overtake they in the drawingroom there be already sit prince alexander dmitrievitch shtcherbatsky young shtcherbatsky turovtsin kitty and karenin stepan arkadyevitch see immediately that thing be not go well in the drawingroom without he darya alexandrovna in her good gray silk gown obviously worried about the child who be to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery and by her husband ’s absence be not equal to the task of make the party mix without he all be sit like so many priest ' wife on a visit so the old prince express it obviously wonder why they be there and pump up remark simply to avoid be silent turovtsin — good simple man — feel unmistakably a fish out of water and the smile with which his thick lip greet stepan arkadyevitch say as plainly as word " well old boy you have pop I down in a learned set a drinking party now or the château des fleurs would be more in my line " the old prince sit in silence his bright little eye watch karenin from one side and stepan arkadyevitch see that he have already form a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guest be invite to partake as though he be a sturgeon kitty be look at the door call up all her energy to keep she from blush at the entrance of konstantin levin young shtcherbatsky who have not be introduce to karenin be try to look as though he be not in the least conscious of it karenin himself have follow the petersburg fashion for a dinner with lady and be wear evening dress and a white tie stepan arkadyevitch see by his face that he have come simply to keep his promise and be perform a disagreeable duty in be present at this gathering he be indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumb all the guest before stepan arkadyevitch come in on enter the drawingroom stepan arkadyevitch apologize explain that he have be detain by that prince who be always the scapegoat for all his absence and unpunctualitie and in one moment he have make all the guest acquainted with each other and bring together alexey alexandrovitch and sergey koznishev start they on a discussion of the russification of poland into which they immediately plunge with pestsov slap turovtsin on the shoulder he whisper something comic in his ear and set he down by his wife and the old prince then he tell kitty she be look very pretty that evening and present shtcherbatsky to karenin in a moment he have so knead together the social dough that the drawingroom become very lively and there be a merry buzz of voice konstantin levin be the only person who have not arrive but this be so much the well as go into the diningroom stepan arkadyevitch find to his horror that the port and sherry have be procure from depré and not from levy and direct that the coachman should be send off as speedily as possible to levy ’s he be go back to the drawingroom in the diningroom he be meet by konstantin levin " I ’m not late " " you can never help be late " say stepan arkadyevitch take his arm " have you a lot of people who ’ here " ask levin unable to help blush as he knock the snow off his cap with his glove " all our own set kitty ’ here come along I ’ll introduce you to karenin " stepan arkadyevitch for all his liberal view be well aware that to meet karenin be sure to be feel a flattering distinction and so treat his good friend to this honor but at that instant konstantin levin be not in a condition to feel all the gratification of make such an acquaintance he have not see kitty since that memorable evening when he meet vronsky not count that be the moment when he have have a glimpse of she on the highroad he have know at the bottom of his heart that he would see she here today but to keep his thought free he have try to persuade himself that he do not know it now when he hear that she be here he be suddenly conscious of such delight and at the same time of such dread that his breath fail he and he could not utter what he want to say " what be she like what be she like like what she use to be or like what she be in the carriage what if darya alexandrovna tell the truth why should not it be the truth " he think " oh please introduce I to karenin " he bring out with an effort and with a desperately determined step he walk into the drawingroom and behold she she be not the same as she use to be nor be she as she have be in the carriage she be quite different she be scared shy shamefaced and still more charming from it she see he the very instant he walk into the room she have be expect he she be delighted and so confused at her own delight that there be a moment the moment when he go up to her sister and glance again at she when she and he and dolly who see it all think she would break down and would begin to cry she crimson turn white crimson again and grow faint wait with quivering lip for he to come to she he go up to she bow and hold out his hand without speak except for the slight quiver of her lip and the moisture in her eye that make they bright her smile be almost calm as she say " how long it be since we ’ve see each other " and with desperate determination she press his hand with her cold hand " you ’ve not see I but I ’ve see you " say levin with a radiant smile of happiness " I see you when you be drive from the railway station to ergushovo " " when " she ask wonder " you be drive to ergushovo " say levin feel as if he would sob with the rapture that be flood his heart " and how dare I associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touch creature and yes I do believe it ’ true what darya alexandrovna tell I " he think stepan arkadyevitch take he by the arm and lead he away to karenin " let I introduce you " he mention their name " very glad to meet you again " say alexey alexandrovitch coldly shake hand with levin " you be acquaint " stepan arkadyevitch ask in surprise " we spend three hour together in the train " say levin smile " but get out just as in a masquerade quite mystified — at least I be " " nonsense come along please " say stepan arkadyevitch point in the direction of the diningroom the man go into the diningroom and go up to a table lay with six sort of spirit and as many kind of cheese some with little silver spade and some without caviar herring preserve of various kind and plate with slice of french bread the man stand round the strongsmelle spirit and salt delicacy and the discussion of the russification of poland between koznishev karenin and pestsov die down in anticipation of dinner sergey ivanovitch be unequaled in his skill in wind up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of attic salt that change the disposition of his opponent he do this now alexey alexandrovitch have be maintain that the russification of poland could only be accomplish as a result of large measure which ought to be introduce by the russian government pestsov insist that one country can only absorb another when it be the more densely populate koznishev admit both point but with limitation as they be go out of the drawingroom to conclude the argument koznishev say smile " so then for the russification of our foreign population there be but one method — to bring up as many child as one can my brother and I be terribly in fault I see you married man especially you stepan arkadyevitch be the real patriot what number have you reach " he say smile genially at their host and hold out a tiny wineglass to he everyone laugh and stepan arkadyevitch with particular good humor " oh yes that ’ the good method " he say munch cheese and fill the wineglass with a special sort of spirit the conversation drop at the jest " this cheese be not bad shall I give you some " say the master of the house " why have you be go in for gymnastic again " he ask levin pinch his muscle with his left hand levin smile bend his arm and under stepan arkadyevitch ’s finger the muscle swell up like a sound cheese hard as a knob of iron through the fine cloth of the coat " what bicep a perfect samson " " I imagine great strength be need for hunt bear " observe alexey alexandrovitch who have the misty notion about the chase he cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spiderweb levin smile " not at all quite the contrary a child can kill a bear " he say with a slight bow move aside for the lady who be approach the table " you have kill a bear I ’ve be tell " say kitty try assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away and set the lace quiver over her white arm " be there bear on your place " she add turn her charming little head to he and smile there be apparently nothing extraordinary in what she say but what unutterable meaning there be for he in every sound in every turn of her lip her eye her hand as she say it there be entreaty for forgiveness and trust in he and tenderness — soft timid tenderness — and promise and hope and love for he which he could not but believe in and which choke he with happiness " no we ’ve be hunt in the tver province it be come back from there that I meet your beaufrère in the train or your beaufrère ’s brotherinlaw " he say with a smile " it be an amusing meeting " and he begin tell with droll goodhumor how after not sleep all night he have wear an old furlined fullskirted coat get into alexey alexandrovitch ’s compartment " the conductor forget the proverb would have chuck I out on account of my attire but thereupon I begin express my feeling in elevated language and   you too " he say address karenin and forget his name " at first would have eject I on the ground of the old coat but afterwards you take my part for which I be extremely grateful " " the right of passenger generally to choose their seat be too illdefined " say alexey alexandrovitch rub the tip of his finger on his handkerchief " I see you be in uncertainty about I " say levin smile goodnaturedly " but I make haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defect of my attire " sergey ivanovitch while he keep up a conversation with their hostess have one ear for his brother and he glance askance at he " what be the matter with he today why such a conquer hero " he think he do not know that levin be feel as though he have grow wing levin know she be listen to his word and that she be glad to listen to he and this be the only thing that interest he not in that room only but in the whole world there exist for he only himself with enormously increase importance and dignity in his own eye and she he feel himself on a pinnacle that make he giddy and far away down below be all those nice excellent karenins oblonskys and all the world quite without attract notice without glance at they as though there be no other place leave stepan arkadyevitch put levin and kitty side by side " oh you may as well sit there " he say to levin the dinner be as choice as the china in which stepan arkadyevitch be a connoisseur the soupe marielouise be a splendid success the tiny pie eat with it melt in the mouth and be irreproachable the two footman and matvey in white cravat do their duty with the dish and wine unobtrusively quietly and swiftly on the material side the dinner be a success it be no less so on the immaterial the conversation at time general and at time between individual never pause and towards the end the company be so lively that the man rise from the table without stop speak and even alexey alexandrovitch thaw pestsov like thrash an argument out to the end and be not satisfied with sergey ivanovitch ’s word especially as he feel the injustice of his view " I do not mean " he say over the soup address alexey alexandrovitch " mere density of population alone but in conjunction with fundamental idea and not by mean of principle " " it seem to I " alexey alexandrovitch say languidly and with no haste " that that ’ the same thing in my opinion influence over another people be only possible to the people which have the high development which " " but that ’ just the question " pestsov break in in his bass he be always in a hurry to speak and seem always to put his whole soul into what he be say " in what be we to make high development consist the english the french the germans which be at the high stage of development which of they will nationalize the other we see the rhine province have be turn french but the germans be not at a low stage " he shout " there be another law at work there " " I fancy that the great influence be always on the side of true civilization " say alexey alexandrovitch slightly lift his eyebrow " but what be we to lay down as the outward sign of true civilization " say pestsov " I imagine such sign be generally very well know " say alexey alexandrovitch " but be they fully know " sergey ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile " it be the accept view now that real culture must be purely classical but we see most intense dispute on each side of the question and there be no deny that the opposite camp have strong point in its favor " " you be for classic sergey ivanovitch will you take red wine " say stepan arkadyevitch " I be not express my own opinion of either form of culture " sergey ivanovitch say hold out his glass with a smile of condescension as to a child " I only say that both side have strong argument to support they " he go on address alexey alexandrovitch " my sympathy be classical from education but in this discussion I be personally unable to arrive at a conclusion I see no distinct ground for classical study be give a preeminence over scientific study " " the natural science have just as great an educational value " put in pestsov " take astronomy take botany or zoology with its system of general principle " " I can not quite agree with that " respond alexey alexandrovitch " it seem to I that one must admit that the very process of study the form of language have a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development moreover it can not be deny that the influence of the classical author be in the high degree moral while unfortunately with the study of the natural science be associate the false and noxious doctrine which be the curse of our day " sergey ivanovitch would have say something but pestsov interrupt he in his rich bass he begin warmly contest the justice of this view sergey ivanovitch wait serenely to speak obviously with a convincing reply ready " but " say sergey ivanovitch smile subtly and address karenin " one must allow that to weigh all the advantage and disadvantage of classical and scientific study be a difficult task and the question which form of education be to be prefer would not have be so quickly and conclusively decide if there have not be in favor of classical education as you express it just now its moral — disons le mot — antinihilist influence " " undoubtedly " " if it have not be for the distinctive property of antinihilistic influence on the side of classical study we should have consider the subject more have weigh the argument on both side " say sergey ivanovitch with a subtle smile " we should have give elbowroom to both tendency but now we know that these little pill of classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism and we boldly prescribe they to our patient but what if they have no such medicinal property " he wind up humorously at sergey ivanovitch ’s little pill everyone laugh turovtsin in especial roar loudly and jovially glad at last to have find something to laugh at all he ever look for in listen to conversation stepan arkadyevitch have not make a mistake in invite pestsov with pestsov intellectual conversation never flag for an instant directly sergey ivanovitch have conclude the conversation with his jest pestsov promptly start a new one " I can not agree even " say he " that the government have that aim the government obviously be guide by abstract consideration and remain indifferent to the influence its measure may exercise the education of woman for instance would naturally be regard as likely to be harmful but the government open school and university for woman " and the conversation at once pass to the new subject of the education of woman alexey alexandrovitch express the idea that the education of woman be apt to be confound with the emancipation of woman and that it be only so that it can be consider dangerous " I consider on the contrary that the two question be inseparably connect together " say pestsov " it be a vicious circle woman be deprive of right from lack of education and the lack of education result from the absence of right we must not forget that the subjection of woman be so complete and date from such age back that we be often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separate they from we " say he " you say right " say sergey ivanovitch wait till pestsov have finish " mean the right of sit on jury of vote of preside at official meeting the right of enter the civil service of sit in parliament " " undoubtedly " " but if woman as a rare exception can occupy such position it seem to I you be wrong in use the expression ' right ' it would be more correct to say duty every man will agree that in do the duty of a juryman a witness a telegraph clerk we feel we be perform duty and therefore it would be correct to say that woman be seek duty and quite legitimately and one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man " " quite so " alexey alexandrovitch assent " the question I imagine be simply whether they be fit for such duty " " they will most likely be perfectly fit " say stepan arkadyevitch " when education have become general among they we see this " " how about the proverb " say the prince who have a long while be intent on the conversation his little comical eye twinkle " I can say it before my daughter her hair be long because her wit be " " just what they think of the negro before their emancipation " say pestsov angrily " what seem strange to I be that woman should seek fresh duty " say sergey ivanovitch " while we see unhappily that man usually try to avoid they " " duty be bind up with right — power money honor those be what woman be seek " say pestsov " just as though I should seek the right to be a wetnurse and feel injure because woman be pay for the work while no one will take I " say the old prince turovtsin explode in a loud roar of laughter and sergey ivanovitch regret that he have not make this comparison even alexey alexandrovitch smile " yes but a man can not nurse a baby " say pestsov " while a woman " " no there be an englishman who do suckle his baby on board ship " say the old prince feel this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughter " there be as many such englishmen as there would be woman official " say sergey ivanovitch " yes but what be a girl to do who have no family " put in stepan arkadyevitch think of masha tchibisova whom he have have in his mind all along in sympathize with pestsov and support he " if the story of such a girl be thoroughly sift you would find she have abandon a family — her own or a sister ’s where she might have find a woman ’s duty " darya alexandrovna break in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation probably suspect what sort of girl stepan arkadyevitch be think of " but we take our stand on principle as the ideal " reply pestsov in his mellow bass " woman desire to have right to be independent educate she be oppress humiliate by the consciousness of her disability " " and I ’m oppress and humiliate that they will not engage I at the foundling " the old prince say again to the huge delight of turovtsin who in his mirth drop his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce everyone take part in the conversation except kitty and levin at first when they be talk of the influence that one people have on another there rise to levin ’s mind what he have to say on the subject but these idea once of such importance in his eye seem to come into his brain as in a dream and have now not the slight interest for he it even strike he as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what be of no use to anyone kitty too should one would have suppose have be interested in what they be say of the right and education of woman how often she have muse on the subject think of her friend abroad varenka of her painful state of dependence how often she have wonder about herself what would become of she if she do not marry and how often she have argue with her sister about it but it do not interest she at all she and levin have a conversation of their own yet not a conversation but some sort of mysterious communication which bring they every moment near and stir in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they be enter at first levin in answer to kitty ’s question how he could have see she last year in the carriage tell she how he have be come home from the mowing along the highroad and have meet she " it be very very early in the morning you be probably only just awake your mother be asleep in the corner it be an exquisite morning I be walk along wonder who it could be in a fourinhand it be a splendid set of four horse with bell and in a second you flash by and I see you at the window — you be sit like this hold the string of your cap in both hand and think awfully

her head sink she be silent for a little thinking of herself of her own grief in her family and all at once with an impulsive movement she raise her head and clasp her hand with an imploring gesture " but wait a little you be a christian think of she what will become of she if you cast she off " " I have think darya alexandrovna I have think a great deal " say alexey alexandrovitch his face turn red in patch and his dim eye look straight before he darya alexandrovna at that moment pity he with all her heart " that be what I do indeed when she herself make known to I my humiliation I leave everything as of old I give she a chance to reform I try to save she and with what result she would not regard the slight request — that she should observe decorum " he say get heated " one may save anyone who do not want to be ruin but if the whole nature be so corrupt so depraved that ruin itself seem to be her salvation what ’ to be do " " anything only not divorce " answer darya alexandrovna " but what be anything " " no it be awful she will be no one ’s wife she will be lose " " what can I do " say alexey alexandrovitch raise his shoulder and his eyebrow the recollection of his wife ’s

anna save I and here I be live on the child be grow up my husband have come back to his family and feel his fault be grow purer well and I live on I have forgive it and you ought to forgive " alexey alexandrovitch hear she but her word have no effect on he now all the hatred of that day when he have resolve on a divorce have spring up again in his soul he shake himself and say in a shrill loud voice " forgive I can not and do not wish to and I regard it as wrong I have do everything for this woman and she have tread it all in the mud to which she be akin I be not a spiteful man I have never hate anyone but I hate she with my whole soul and I can not even forgive she because I hate she too much for all the wrong she have do I " he say with tone of hatred in his voice " love those that hate you " darya alexandrovna whisper timorously alexey alexandrovitch smile contemptuously that he know long ago but it could not be apply to his case " love those that hate you but to love those one hate be impossible forgive I for have trouble you everyone have enough to bear in his own grief " and regain his selfpossession alexey alexandrovitch quietly take leave and go away when they rise from table levin would have like to follow kitty into the drawingroom but he be afraid she might dislike this as too obviously pay her attention he remain in the little ring of man take part in the general conversation and without look at kitty he be aware of her movement her look and the place where she be in the drawingroom he do at once and without the small effort keep the promise he have make she — always to think well of all man and to like everyone always the conversation fall on the village commune in which pestsov see a sort of special principle call by he the " choral " principle levin do not agree with pestsov nor with his brother who have a special attitude of his own both admit and not admit the significance of the russian commune but he talk to they simply try to reconcile and soften their difference he be not in the least interested in what he say himself and even less so in what they say all he want be that they and everyone should be happy and contented he know now the one thing of importance and that one thing be at first there in the drawingroom and then begin move across and come to a standstill at the door without turn round he feel the eye fix on he and the smile and he could not help turn round she be stand in the doorway with shtcherbatsky look at he " I think you be go towards the piano " say he go up to she " that ’ something I miss in the country — music " " no we only come to fetch you and thank you " she say reward he with a smile that be like a gift " for come what do they want to argue for no one ever convince anyone you know " " yes that ’ true " say levin " it generally happen that one argue warmly simply because one can not make out what one ’s opponent want to prove " levin have often notice in discussion between the most intelligent people that after enormous effort and an enormous expenditure of logical subtlety and word the disputant finally arrive at be aware that what they have so long be struggle to prove to one another have long ago from the beginning of the argument be know to both but that they like different thing and would not define what they like for fear of its be attack he have often have the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasp what it be his opponent like and at once like it too and immediately he find himself agree and then all argument fall away as useless sometimes too he have experience the opposite express at last what he like himself which he be devise argument to defend and chance to express it well and genuinely he have find his opponent at once agree and cease to dispute his position he try to say this she knit her brow try to understand but directly he begin to illustrate his meaning she understand at once " I know one must find out what he be argue for what be precious to he then one can " she have completely guess and express his badly express idea levin smile joyfully he be strike by this transition from the confused verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic clear almost wordless communication of the most complex idea shtcherbatsky move away from they and kitty go up to a cardtable sit down and take up the chalk begin draw diverge circle over the new green cloth they begin again on the subject that have be start at dinner — the liberty and occupation of woman levin be of the opinion of darya alexandrovna that a girl who do not marry should find a woman ’s duty in a family he support this view by the fact that no family can get on without woman to help that in every family poor or rich there be and must be nurse either relation or hire " no " say kitty blush but look at he all the more boldly with her truthful eye " a girl may be so circumstanced that she can not live in the family without humiliation while she herself " at the hint he understand she " oh yes " he say " yes yes yes — you’re right you ’re right " and he see all that pestsov have be maintain at dinner of the liberty of woman simply from get a glimpse of the terror of an old maid ’s existence and its humiliation in kitty ’s heart and love she he feel that terror and humiliation and at once give up his argument a silence follow she be still draw with the chalk on the table her eye be shine with a soft light under the influence of her mood he feel in all his being a continually grow tension of happiness " ah I ’ve scribble all over the table " she say and lay down the chalk she make a movement as though to get up " what shall I be leave alone — without she " he think with horror and he take the chalk " wait a minute " he say sit down to the table " I ’ve long want to ask you one thing " he look straight into she caress though frightened eye " please ask it " " here " he say and he write the initial letter w y t m i c n b d t m n o t these letter mean " when you tell I it could never be do that mean never or then " there seem no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence but he look at she as though his life depend on she understand the word she glance at he seriously then lean her puckered brow on her hand and begin to read once or twice she steal a look at he as though ask he " be it what I think " " I understand " she say flush a little " what be this word " he say point to the n that stand for never " it mean never " she say " but that ’ not true " he quickly rub out what he have write give she the chalk and stand up she write t i c n a d dolly be completely comfort in the depression cause by her conversation with alexey alexandrovitch when she catch sight of the two figure kitty with the chalk in her

a whisper he sit down and write a long phrase she understand it all and without ask he " be it this " take the chalk and at once answer for a long while he could not understand what she have write and often look into her eye he be stupefied with happiness he could not supply the word she have mean but in her charming eye beam with happiness he see all he need to know and he write three letter but he have hardly finish write when she read they over her arm and herself finish and write the answer " yes " " you ’re play secrétaire " say the old prince " but we must really be get along if you want

congratulation say " how glad I be you have meet kitty again one must value old friend " levin do not like these word of darya alexandrovna ’s she could not understand how lofty and beyond she it all be and she ought not to have dare to allude to it levin say goodbye to they but not to be leave alone he attach himself to his brother " where be you go " " I ’m go to a meeting " " well I ’ll come with you may I " " what for yes come along " say sergey ivanovitch smile " what be the matter with you today " " with I happiness be the matter with I " say levin let down the window of the carriage

ivanovitch be begin " do n’t say it do not say it " shout levin clutch at the collar of his fur coat with both hand and muffle he up in it " she ’ a nice girl " be such simple humble word so out of harmony with his feeling sergey ivanovitch laugh outright a merry laugh which be rare with he " well anyway I may say that I ’m very glad of it " " that you may do tomorrow tomorrow and nothing more nothing nothing silence " say levin and muffle he once more in his fur coat he add " I do like you so well be it possible for I to be present at the meeting " " of course it be " " what be your discussion about today " ask levin never cease smile they arrive at the meeting levin hear the secretary hesitatingly read the minute which he obviously do not himself understand but levin see from this secretary ’s face what a good nice kindhearted person he be this be evident from his confusion and embarrassment in read the minute then the discussion begin they be dispute about the misappropriation of certain sum and the laying of certain pipe and sergey ivanovitch be very cutting to two member and say something at great length with an air of triumph and another member scribble something on a bit of paper begin timidly at first but afterwards answer he very viciously and delightfully and then sviazhsky he be there too say something too very handsomely and nobly levin listen to they and see clearly that these miss sum and these pipe be not anything real and that they be not at all angry but be all the nice kind people and everything be as happy and charming as possible among they they do no harm to anyone and be all enjoy it what strike levin be that he could see through they all today and from little almost imperceptible sign know the soul of each and see distinctly that they be all good at heart and levin himself in particular they be all extremely fond of that day that be evident from the way they speak to he from the friendly affectionate way even those he do not know look at he " well do you like it " sergey ivanovitch ask he " very much I never suppose it be so interesting capital splendid " sviazhsky go up to levin and invite he to come round to tea with he levin be utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it be he have dislike in sviazhsky what he have fail to find in he he be a clever and wonderfully goodhearted man " most delighted " he say and ask after his wife and sisterinlaw and from a queer association of idea because in his imagination the idea of sviazhsky ’s sisterinlaw be connect with marriage it occur to he that there be no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness and he be very glad to go and see they sviazhsky question he about his improvement on his estate presuppose as he always do that there be no possibility of do anything not do already in europe and now this do not in the least annoy levin on the contrary he feel that sviazhsky be right that the whole business be of little value and he see the wonderful softness and consideration with which sviazhsky avoid fully express his correct view the lady of the sviazhsky household be particularly delightful it seem to levin that they know all about it already and sympathize with he say nothing merely from delicacy he stay with they one hour two three talk of all sort of subject but the one thing that fill his heart and do not observe that he be bore they dreadfully and that it be long past their bedtime sviazhsky go with he into the hall yawn and wonder at the strange humor his friend be in it be past one o’clock levin go back to his hotel and be dismay at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he have ten hour still leave to get through the servant whose turn it be to be up all night light his candle and would have go away but levin stop he this servant yegor whom levin have notice before strike he as a very intelligent excellent and above all goodhearted man " well yegor it ’ hard work not sleep be

sempstress whom he want to marry to a cashier in a saddler ’s shop levin on hear this inform yegor that in his opinion in marriage the great thing be love and that with love one would always be happy for happiness rest only on oneself yegor listen attentively and obviously quite take in levin ’s idea but by way of assent to it he enunciate greatly to levin ’s surprise the observation that when he have live with good master he have always be satisfied with his master and now be perfectly satisfied with his employer though he be a frenchman " wonderfully goodhearted fellow " think levin " well but you yourself yegor when you get marry do you love your wife " " ay and why not " respond yegor and levin see that yegor too be in an excited state and intend to express all his most heartfelt emotion " my life too have be a wonderful one from a child up " he be begin with flash eye apparently catch levin ’s enthusiasm just as people catch yawn but at that moment a ring be hear yegor depart

for he with his view of life after the conversation with alexey alexandrovitch vronsky go out onto the step of the karenins ' house and stand still with difficulty remember where he be and where he ought to walk or drive he feel disgraced humiliate guilty and deprive of all possibility of wash away his humiliation he feel thrust out of the beaten track along which he have so proudly and lightly walk till then all the habit and rule of his life that have seem so firm have turn out suddenly false and inapplicable the betray husband who have figure till that time as a pitiful creature an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness have suddenly be summon by she herself elevate to an aweinspiring pinnacle and on the pinnacle that husband have show himself not malignant not false not ludicrous but kind and straightforward and large vronsky could not but feel this and the part be suddenly reverse vronsky feel his elevation and his own abasement his truth and his own falsehood he feel that the husband be magnanimous even in his sorrow while he have be base and petty in his deceit but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he have unjustly despise make up only a small part of his misery he feel unutterably wretched now for his passion for anna which have seem to he of late to be grow cool now that he know he have lose she forever be strong than ever it have be he have see all of she in her illness have come to know her very soul and it seem to he that he have never love she till then and now when he have learn to know she to love she as she should be love he have be humiliate before she and have lose she forever leave with she nothing of himself but a shameful memory most terrible of all have be his ludicrous shameful position when alexey alexandrovitch have pull his hand away from his humiliate face he stand on the step of the karenins ' house like one distraught and do not know what to do " a sledge sir " ask the porter " yes a sledge " on get home after three sleepless night vronsky without undress lie down flat on the sofa clasp his hand and lay his head on they his head be heavy image memory and idea of the strange description follow one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness first it be the medicine he have pour out for the patient and spill over the spoon then the midwife ’s white hand then the queer posture of alexey alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed " to sleep to forget " he say to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he be tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head do begin to feel drowsy and he begin to drop off into forgetfulness the wave of the sea of unconsciousness have begin to meet over his head when all at once — it be as though a violent shock of electricity have pass over he he start so that he leap up on the spring of the sofa and lean on his arm get in a panic onto his knee his eye be wide open as though he have never be asleep the heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limb that he have feel a minute before have suddenly go " you may trample I in the mud " he hear alexey alexandrovitch ’s word and see he stand before he and see anna ’s face with its burn flush and glitter eye gaze with love and tenderness not at he but at alexey alexandrovitch he see his own as he fancy foolish and ludicrous figure when alexey alexandrovitch take his hand away from his face he stretch out his leg again and fling himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eye " to sleep to forget " he repeat to himself but with his eye shut he see more distinctly than ever anna ’s face as it have be on the memorable evening before the race " that be not and will not be and she want to wipe it out of her memory but I can not live without it how can we be reconcile how can we be reconcile " he say aloud and unconsciously begin to repeat these word this repetition check the rise up of fresh image and memory which he feel be throng in his brain but repeat word do not check his imagination for long again in extraordinarily rapid succession his good moment rise before his mind and then his recent humiliation " take away his hand " anna ’s voice say he take away his hand and feel the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face he still lie down try to sleep though he feel there be not the small hope of it and keep repeat stray word from some chain of thought try by this to check the rise flood of fresh image he listen and hear in a strange mad whisper word repeat " I do not appreciate it do not make enough of it I do not appreciate it do not make enough of it " " what ’ this be I go out of my mind " he say to himself " perhaps what make man go out of their mind what make man shoot themselves " he answer himself and open his eye he see with wonder an embroider cushion beside he work by varya his brother ’s wife he touch the tassel of the cushion and try to think of varya of when he have see she last but to think of anything extraneous be an agonizing effort " no I must sleep " he move the cushion up and press his head into it but he have to make an effort to keep his eye shut he jump up and sit down " that ’ all over for I " he say to himself " I must think what to do what be leave " his mind rapidly run through his life apart from his love of anna " ambition serpuhovskoy society the court " he could not come to a pause you all of it have have meaning before but now there be no reality in it he get up from the sofa take off his coat undo his belt and uncover his hairy chest to breathe more freely walk up and down the room " this be how people go mad " he repeat " and how they shoot themselves   to escape humiliation " he add slowly he go to the door and close it then with fix eye and clench tooth he go up to the table take a revolver look round he turn it to a load barrel and sink into thought for two minute his head bend forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought he stand with the revolver in his hand motionless think " of course " he say to himself as though a logical continuous and clear chain of reasoning have bring he to an indubitable conclusion in reality this " of course " that seem convincing to he be simply the result of exactly the same circle of memory and image through which he have pass ten time already during the last hour — memory of happiness lose forever there be the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life the same consciousness of humiliation even the sequence of these image and emotion be the same " of course " he repeat when for the third time his thought pass again round the same spellbound circle of memory and image and pull the revolver to the left side of his chest and clutch it vigorously with his whole hand as it be squeeze it in his fist he pull the trigger he do not hear the sound of the shot but a violent blow on his chest send he reel he try to clutch at the edge of the table drop the revolver stagger and sit down on the ground look about he in astonishment he do not recognize his room look up from the ground at the bent leg of the table at the wastepaper basket and the tigerskin rug the hurried creak step of his servant come through the drawingroom bring he to his sense he make an effort at thought and be aware that he be on the floor and see blood on the tigerskin rug and on his arm he know he have shoot himself " idiotic miss " he say fumble after the revolver the revolver be close beside he — he seek far off still feel for it he stretch out to the other side and not be strong enough to keep his balance fall over stream with blood the elegant whiskered manservant who use to be continually complain to his acquaintance of the delicacy of his nerve be so panicstricken on see his master lie on the floor that he leave he lose blood while he run for assistance an hour later varya his brother ’s wife have arrive and with the assistance of three doctor whom she have send for in all direction and who all appear at the same moment she get the wounded man to bed and remain to nurse he the mistake make by alexey alexandrovitch in that when prepare for see his wife he have overlook the possibility that her repentance might be sincere and he might forgive she and she might not die — this mistake be two month after his return from moscow bring home to he in all its significance but the mistake make by he have arise not simply from his have overlook that contingency but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his die wife he have not know his own heart at his sick wife ’s bedside he have for the first time in his life give way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always rouse in he by the suffering of other and hitherto look on by he with shame as a harmful weakness and pity for she and remorse for have desire her death and most of all the joy of forgiveness make he at once conscious not simply of the relief of his own suffering but of a spiritual peace he have never experience before he suddenly feel that the very thing that be the source of his suffering have become the source of his spiritual joy that what have seem insoluble while he be judge blame and hate have become clear and simple when he forgave and love he forgave his wife and pity she for her suffering and her remorse he forgive vronsky and pity he especially after report reach he of his despairing action he feel more for his son than before and he blame himself now for have take too little interest in he but for the little newborn baby he feel a quite peculiar sentiment not of pity only but of tenderness at first from a feeling of compassion alone he have be interested in the delicate little creature who be not his child and who be cast on one side during her mother ’s illness and would certainly have die if he have not trouble about she and he do not himself observe how fond he become of she he would go into the nursery several time a day and sit there for a long while so that the nurse who be at first afraid of he get quite used to his presence sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gaze at the saffronred downy wrinkled face of the sleep baby watch the movement of the frown brow and the fat little hand with clench finger that rub the little eye and nose at such moment particularly alexey alexandrovitch have a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony and see nothing extraordinary in his position nothing that ought to be change but as time go on he see more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seem to he he would not long be allow to remain in it he feel that besides the blessed spiritual force control his soul there be another a brutal force as powerful or more powerful which control his life and that this force would not allow he that humble peace he long for he feel that everyone be look at he with inquire wonder that he be not understand and that something be expect of he above all he feel the instability and unnaturalness of his relation with his wife when the soften effect of the near approach of death have pass away alexey alexandrovitch begin to notice that anna be afraid of he ill at ease with he and could not look he straight in the face she seem to be want and not dare to tell he something and as though

that he grin during all this difficult time alexey alexandrovitch have notice that his worldly acquaintance especially woman take a peculiar interest in he and his wife all these acquaintance he observe with difficulty conceal their mirth at something the same mirth that he have perceive in the lawyer ’s eye and just now in the eye of this groom everyone seem somehow hugely delighted as though they have just be at a wedding when they meet he with illdisguised enjoyment they inquire after his wife ’s health the presence of princess tverskaya be unpleasant to alexey alexandrovitch from

when the child at last be still and have be put in a deep bed and the nurse after smooth the little pillow have leave she alexey alexandrovitch get up and walk awkwardly on tiptoe approach the baby for a minute he be still and with the same despondent face gaze at the baby but all at once a smile that move his hair and the skin of his forehead come out on his face and he go as softly out of the room in the diningroom he ring the bell and tell the servant who come in to send again for the doctor he feel vexed with his wife for not be anxious about this exquisite baby and in this vexed humor he have no wish to go to she he have no wish either to see princess betsy but his wife might wonder why he do not go to she as usual and so overcome his disinclination he go towards the bedroom as he

undignified he turn back again and clear his throat he go up to the bedroom the voice be silent and he go in anna in a gray dressing gown with a crop of short cluster black curl on her round head be sit on a settee the eagerness die out of her face as it always do at the sight of her husband she drop her head and look round uneasily at betsy betsy dress in the height of the late fashion in a hat that tower somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp in a blue dress with violet crossway stripe slant one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt be sit beside anna her tall flat figure hold erect bow her head she greet alexey alexandrovitch with an ironical smile " ah " she say as though surprised " I ’m very glad you ’re at home you never put in an appearance anywhere and I have not see you ever since anna have be ill I have hear all about it — your anxiety yes you ’re a wonderful husband " she say with a meaning and affable air as though she be bestow an order of magnanimity on he for his conduct to his wife alexey alexandrovitch bow frigidly and kiss his wife ’s hand ask how she be " well I think " she say avoid his eye " but you ’ve rather a feverishlooking color " he

oh no I can not receive he and what object would there " she stop suddenly and glance inquiringly at her husband he do not look at she " in short I do not wish it " alexey alexandrovitch advance and would have take her hand her first impulse be to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen vein that seek hers but with an obvious effort to control herself she press his hand " I be very grateful to you for your confidence but " he say feel with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself he could not discuss before princess tverskaya who to he stand for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control he in the life he lead in the eye of the world and hinder he from give way to his feeling of love and forgiveness he stop short look at princess tverskaya " well goodbye my darling " say betsy get up she kiss anna and go out alexey alexandrovitch escort she out " alexey alexandrovitch I know you be a truly magnanimous man " say betsy stop in the little drawingroom and with special warmth shake hand with he once more " I be an outsider but I so love she and respect you that I venture to advise receive he alexey vronsky be the soul of honor and he be go away to tashkend " " thank you princess for your sympathy and advice but the question of whether my wife can or can not see anyone she must decide herself " he say this from habit lift his brow with dignity and reflect immediately that whatever his word might be there could be no dignity in his position and he see this by the suppress malicious and ironical smile with which betsy glance at he after this phrase alexey alexandrovitch take leave of betsy in the drawingroom and go to his wife she be lie down but hear his step she sit up hastily in her former attitude and look in a scared way at he he see she have be cry " I be very grateful for your confidence in I " he repeat gently in russian the phrase he have say in betsy ’s presence in french and sit down beside she when he speak to she in russian use the russian " thou " of intimacy and affection it be insufferably irritating to anna " and I be very grateful for your decision I too imagine that since he be go away there be no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here however if " " but I ’ve say so already so why repeat it " anna suddenly interrupt he with an irritation she could not succeed in repress " no sort of necessity " she think " for a man to come and say goodbye to the woman he love for whom he be ready to ruin himself and have ruin himself and who can not live without he no sort of necessity " she compress her lip and drop her burn eye to his hand with their swollen vein they be rub each other " let we never speak of it " she add more calmly " I have leave this question to you to decide and I be very glad to see " alexey alexandrovitch be begin " that my wish coincide with your own " she finish quickly exasperated at his talk so slowly while she know beforehand all he would say " yes " he assent " and princess tverskaya ’s interference in the most difficult private affair be utterly uncalled for she especially " " I do not believe a word of what ’ say about she " say anna quickly " I know she really care for I " alexey alexandrovitch sigh and say nothing she play nervously with the tassel of her dressinggown glance at he with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blame herself though she could not control it her only desire now be to be rid of his oppressive presence " I have just send for the doctor " say alexey alexandrovitch " I be very well what do I want the doctor for " " no the little one cry and they say the nurse have not enough milk " " why do not you let I nurse she when I beg to anyway "

not go on like this " alexey alexandrovitch say to himself decidedly as he leave his wife ’s room never have the impossibility of his position in the world ’s eye and his wife ’s hatred of he and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guide his life against his spiritual inclination and exact conformity with its decree and change in his attitude to his wife be present to he with such distinctness as that day he see clearly that all the world and his wife expect of he something but what exactly he could not make out he feel that this be rouse in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement he believe that for anna herself it would be well to break off all relation with vronsky but if you all think this out of the question he be even ready to allow these relation to be renew so long as the child be not disgrace and he be not deprive of they nor force to change his position bad as this might be it be anyway well than a rupture which would put she in a hopeless and shameful position and deprive he of everything he care for but he feel helpless he know beforehand that everyone be against he and that he would not be allow to do what seem to he now so natural and right but would be force to do what be wrong though it seem the proper thing to they before betsy have time to walk out of the drawingroom she be meet in the doorway by stepan arkadyevitch who have just come from yeliseev ’s where a consignment of fresh oyster have be receive " ah princess what a delightful meeting " he begin " I ’ve be to see you " " a meeting for one minute for I ’m go " say betsy smile and put on her glove " do not put on your glove yet princess let I kiss your hand there ’ nothing I ’m so thankful to the revival

go back into the drawingroom they stand in a corner " he ’ kill she " say betsy in a whisper full of meaning " it ’ impossible impossible " " I ’m so glad you think so " say stepan arkadyevitch shake his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression " that ’ what I ’ve come to petersburg for " " the whole town ’ talk of it " she say " it ’ an impossible position she pine and pine away he do not understand that she ’ one of those woman who can not trifle with their feeling one of two thing either let he take she away act with energy or give she a divorce this be stifle she " " yes yes   just so " oblonsky say sigh " that ’ what I ’ve come for at least not solely for that   I ’ve be make a kammerherr of course one have to say thank you but the chief thing be have to settle this " " well god help you " say betsy after accompany betsy to the outside hall once more kiss her hand above the glove at the point where the pulse beat and murmur to she such unseemly nonsense that she do not know whether to laugh or be angry stepan arkadyevitch go to his sister he find she in tear although he happen to be bubble over with good spirit stepan arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fall into the sympathetic poetically emotional tone which harmonize with her mood he ask she how she be and how she have spend the morning " very very miserably today and this morning and all past day and day to come " she say " I think you ’re give way to pessimism you must rouse yourself you must look life in the face I know it ’ hard but " " I have hear it say that woman love man even for their vice " anna begin suddenly " but I hate he for his virtue I can not live with he do you understand the sight of he have a physical effect on I it make I beside myself I can not I can not live with he what be I to do I have be unhappy and use to think one could not be more unhappy but the awful state of thing I be go through now I could never have conceive would you believe it that know he ’ a good man a splendid man that I ’m not worth his little finger still I hate he I hate he for his generosity and there ’ nothing leave for I but " she would have say death but stepan arkadyevitch would not let she finish " you be ill and overwrought " he say " believe I you ’re exaggerate dreadfully there ’ nothing so terrible in it " and stepan arkadyevitch smile no one else in stepan arkadyevitch ’s place have to do with such despair would have venture to smile the smile would have seem brutal but in his smile there be so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile do not wound but soften and soothe his gentle soothing word and smile be as soothing and softening as almond oil and anna soon feel this " no stiva " she say " I ’m lost lost worse than lose I can not say yet that all be over on the contrary I feel that it ’ not over I ’m an overstrain string that must snap but it ’ not end yet   and it will have a fearful end " " no matter we must let the string be loosen little by little there ’ no position from which there be no way of escape " " I have think and think only one " again he know from her terrified eye that this one way of escape in her thought be death and he would not let she say it " not at all " he say " listen to I you can not see your own position as I can let I tell you candidly my opinion " again he smile discreetly his almondoil smile " I ’ll begin from the beginning you marry a man twenty year old than yourself you marry he without love and not know what love be it be a mistake let ’s admit " " a fearful mistake " say anna " but I repeat it ’ an accomplished fact then you have let we say the misfortune to love a man not your husband that be a misfortune but that too be an accomplished fact and your husband know it and forgive it " he stop at each sentence wait for she to object but she make no answer " that ’ so now the question be can you go on live with your husband do you wish it do he wish it " " I know nothing nothing " " but you say yourself that you can not endure he " " no I do not say so I deny it I can not tell I do not know anything about it " " yes but let " " you can not understand I feel I ’m lie head downwards in a sort of pit but I ought not to save myself and I can n’t " " never mind we ’ll slip something under and pull you out I understand you I understand that you can not take it on yourself to express your wish your feeling " " there ’ nothing nothing I wish   except for it to be all over " " but he see this and know it and do you suppose it weigh on he any less than on you you ’re wretched he ’ wretched and what good can come of it while divorce would solve the difficulty completely " with some effort stepan arkadyevitch bring out his central idea and look significantly at she she say nothing and shake her cropped head in dissent but from the look in her face that suddenly brighten into its old beauty he see that if she do not desire this it be simply because it seem to she unattainable happiness " I ’m awfully sorry for you and how happy I should be if I could arrange thing " say stepan arkadyevitch smile more boldly " do not speak do not say a word god grant only that I may speak as I feel I ’m go to he " anna look at he with dreamy shine eye and say nothing stepan arkadyevitch with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he use to take his presidential chair at his board walk into alexey alexandrovitch ’s room alexey alexandrovitch be walk about his room with his hand behind his back think of just what stepan arkadyevitch have be discuss with his wife " I ’m not interrupt you " say stepan arkadyevitch on the sight of his brotherinlaw become suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with he to conceal this embarrassment he take out a cigarette case he have just buy that open in a new way and sniff the leather take a cigarette out of it " no do you want anything " alexey alexandrovitch ask without eagerness " yes I wish   I want   yes I want to talk to you " say stepan arkadyevitch with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity this feeling be so unexpected and so strange that he do not believe it be the voice of conscience tell he that what he be mean to do be wrong stepan arkadyevitch make an effort and struggle with the timidity that have come over he " I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you " he say redden alexey alexandrovitch stand still and say nothing but his face strike stepan arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice " I intend   I want to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position " he say still struggle with an unaccustomed constraint alexey alexandrovitch smile mournfully look at his brotherinlaw and without answer go up to the table take from it an unfinished letter and hand it to his brotherinlaw " I think unceasingly of the same thing and here be what I have begin write think I could say it well by letter and that my presence irritate she " he say as he give he the letter stepan arkadyevitch take the letter look with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eye fix so immovably on he and begin to read " I see that my presence be irksome to you painful as it be to I to believe it I see that it be so and can not be otherwise I do not blame you and god be my witness that on see you at the time of your illness I resolve with my whole heart to forget all that have pass between we and to begin a new life I do not regret and shall never regret what I have do but I have desire one thing — your good the good of your soul — and now I see I have not attain that tell I yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul I put myself entirely in your hand and trust to your feeling of what ’ right " stepan arkadyevitch hand back the letter and with the same surprise continue look at his brotherinlaw not know what to say this silence be so awkward for both of they that stepan arkadyevitch ’s lip begin twitch nervously while he still gaze without speak at karenin ’s face " that ’ what I want to say to she " say alexey alexandrovitch turn away " yes yes " say stepan arkadyevitch not able to answer for the tear that be choke he " yes yes I understand you " he bring out at last " I want to know what she would like " say alexey alexandrovitch " I be afraid she do not understand her own position she be not a judge " say stepan arkadyevitch recover himself " she be crush simply crush by your generosity if she be to read this letter she would be incapable of say anything she would only hang her head low than ever " " yes but what ’ to be do in that case how explain how find out her wish " " if you will allow I to give my opinion I think that it lie with you to point out directly the step you consider necessary to end the position " " so you consider it must be end " alexey alexandrovitch interrupt he " but how " he add with a gesture of his hand before his eye not usual with he " I see no possible way out of it " " there be some way of get out of every position " say stepan arkadyevitch stand up and become more cheerful " there be a time when you think of break off if you be convince now that you can not make each other happy " " happiness may be variously understand but suppose that I agree to everything that I want nothing what way be there of get out of our position " " if you care to know my opinion " say stepan arkadyevitch with the same smile of soften almondoil tenderness with which he have be talk to anna his kindly smile be so winning that alexey alexandrovitch feel his own weakness and unconsciously sway by it be ready to believe what stepan arkadyevitch be say " she will never speak out about it but one thing be possible one thing she might desire " he go on " that be the cessation of your relation and all memory associate with they to my thinking in your position what ’ essential be the formation of a new attitude to one another and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both side " " divorce " alexey alexandrovitch interrupt in a tone of aversion " yes I imagine that divorce — yes divorce " stepan arkadyevitch repeat redden " that be from every point of view the most rational course for marry people who find themselves in the position you be in what can be do if married people find that life be impossible for they together that may always happen " alexey alexandrovitch sigh heavily and close his eye " there ’ only one point to be consider be either of the party desirous of form new tie if not it be very simple " say stepan arkadyevitch feel more and more free from constraint alexey alexandrovitch scowl with emotion mutter something to himself and make no answer all that seem so simple to stepan arkadyevitch alexey alexandrovitch have think over thousand of time and so far from be simple it all seem to he utterly impossible divorce the detail of which he know by this time seem to he now out of the question because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbid his take upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery and still more suffering his wife pardon and belove by he to be catch in the fact and put to public shame divorce appear to he impossible also on other still more weighty ground what would become of his son in case of a divorce to leave he with his mother be out of the question the divorce mother would have her own illegitimate family in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good keep he with he he know that would be an act of vengeance on his part and that he do not want but apart from this what more than all make divorce seem impossible to alexey alexandrovitch be that by consent to a divorce he would be completely ruin anna the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow that in decide on a divorce he be think of himself and not consider that by this he would be ruin she irrevocably have sink into his heart and connect this saying with his forgiveness of she with his devotion to the child he understand it now in his own way to consent to a divorce to give she her freedom mean in his thought to take from himself the last tie that bind he to life — the child whom he love and to take from she the last prop that stay she on the path of right to thrust she down to her ruin if she be divorce he know she would join her life to vronsky ’s and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one since a wife by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law could not marry while her husband be live " she will join he and in a year or two he will throw she over or she will form a new tie " think alexey alexandrovitch " and I by agree to an unlawful divorce shall be to blame for her ruin " he have think it all over hundred of time and be convinced that a divorce be not at all simple as stepan arkadyevitch have say but be utterly impossible he do not believe a single word stepan arkadyevitch say to he to every word he have a thousand objection to make but he listen to he feel that his word be the expression of that mighty brutal force which control his life and to which he would have to submit " the only question be on what term you agree to give she a divorce she do not want anything do not dare ask you for anything she leave it all to your generosity " " my god my god what for " think alexey alexandrovitch remember the detail of divorce proceeding in which the husband take the blame on himself and with just the same gesture with which vronsky have do the same he hide his face for shame in his hand " you be distressed I understand that but if you think it over " " whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to he the other also and if any man take away thy coat let he have thy cloak also " think alexey alexandrovitch " yes yes " he cry in a shrill voice " I will take the disgrace on myself I will give up even my son but   but would not it be well to let it alone still you may do as you like " and turn away so that his brotherinlaw could not see he he sit down on a chair at the window there be bitterness there be shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he feel joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness stepan arkadyevitch be touch he be silent for a space " alexey alexandrovitch believe I she appreciate your generosity " he say " but it seem it be the will of god " he add and as he say it feel how foolish a remark it be and with difficulty repress a smile at his own foolishness alexey alexandrovitch would have make some reply but tear stop he " this be an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and be do my good to help both she and you " say stepan arkadyevitch when he go out of his brotherinlaw ’s room he be touch but that do not prevent he from be glad he have successfully bring the matter to a conclusion for he feel certain alexey alexandrovitch would not go back on his word to this satisfaction be add the fact that an idea have just strike he for a riddle turn on his successful achievement that when the affair be over he would ask his wife and most intimate friend he put this riddle into two or three different way " but I ’ll work it out well than that " he say to himself with a smile vronsky ’s wound have be a dangerous one though it do not touch the heart and for several day he have lie between life and death the first time he be able to speak varya his brother ’s wife be alone in the room " varya " he say look sternly at she " I shoot myself by accident and please never speak of it and tell everyone so or else it ’ too ridiculous " without answer his word varya bend over he and with a delighted smile gaze into his face his eye be clear not feverish but their expression be stern " thank god " she say " you ’re not in pain " " a little here " he point to his breast " then let I change your bandage " in silence stiffen his broad jaw he look at she while she bandage he up when she have finish he say " I ’m not delirious please manage that there may be no talk of my have shoot myself on purpose " " no one do say so only I hope you will not shoot yourself by accident any more " she say with a questioning smile " of course I will not but it would have be well " and he smile gloomily in spite of these word and this smile which so frighten varya when the inflammation be over and he begin to recover he feel that he be completely free from one part of his misery by his action he have as it be wash away the shame and humiliation he have feel before he could now think calmly of alexey alexandrovitch he recognize all his magnanimity but he do not now feel himself humiliate by it besides he get back again into the beaten track of his life he see the possibility of look man in the face again without shame and he could live in accordance with his own habit one thing he could not pluck out of his heart though he never cease struggle with it be the regret amount to despair that he have lose she forever that now have expiate his sin against the husband he be bind to renounce she and never in future to stand between she with her repentance and her husband he have firmly decide in his heart but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love he could not erase from his memory those moment of happiness that he have so little prize at the time and that haunt he in all their charm serpuhovskoy have plan his appointment at tashkend and vronsky agree to the proposition without the slight hesitation but the near the time of departure come the bitterer be the sacrifice he be make to what he think his duty his wound have heal and he be drive about make preparation for his departure for tashkend " to see she once and then to bury myself to die " he think and as he be pay farewell visit he utter this thought to betsy charge with this commission betsy have go to anna and bring he back a negative reply " so much the well " think vronsky when he receive the news " it be a weakness which would have shatter what strength I have leave " next day betsy herself come to he in the morning and announce that she have hear through oblonsky as a positive fact that alexey alexandrovitch have agree to a divorce and that therefore vronsky could see anna without even trouble himself to see betsy out of his flat forget all his resolution without ask when he could see she where her husband be vronsky drive straight to the karenins ' he run up the stair see no one and nothing and with a rapid step almost break into a run he go into her room and without consider without notice whether there be anyone in the room or not he fling his arm round she and begin to cover her face her hand her neck with kiss anna have be prepare herself for this meeting have think what she would say to he but she do not succeed in say anything of it his passion master she she try to calm he to calm herself but it be too late his feeling infect she her lip tremble so that for a long while she could say nothing " yes you have conquer I and I be yours " she say at last press his hand to her bosom " so it have to be " he say " so long as we live it must be so I know it now " " that ’ true " she say get white and white and embrace his head " still there be something terrible in it after all that have happen " " it will all pass it will all pass we shall be so happy our love if it could be strong will be strengthen by there be something terrible in it " he say lift his head and part his strong tooth in a smile and she could not but respond with a smile — not to his word but to the love in his eye she take his hand and stroke her chilled cheek and crop head with it " I do not know you with this short hair you ’ve grow so pretty a boy but how pale you be " " yes I ’m very weak " she say smile and her lip begin tremble again " we ’ll go to italy you will get strong " he say " can it be possible we could be like husband and wife alone your family with you " she say look close into his eye " it only seem strange to I that it can ever have be otherwise " " stiva say that he have agree to everything but I can not accept his generosity " she say look dreamily past vronsky ’s face " I do not want a divorce it ’ all the same to I now only I do not know what he will decide about seryozha " he could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son of divorce what do it all matter " do not speak of that do not think of it " he say turn her hand in his and try to draw her attention to he but still she do not look at he " oh why do not I die it would have be well " she say and silent tear flow down both her cheek but she try to smile so as not to wound he to decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at tashkend would have be vronsky have till then consider disgraceful and impossible but now without an instant ’s consideration he decline it and observe dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarter at this step he immediately retire from the army a month later alexey alexandrovitch be leave alone with his son in his house at petersburg while anna and vronsky have go abroad not have obtain a divorce but have absolutely decline all idea of one princess shtcherbatskaya consider that it be out of the question for the wedding to take place before lent just five week off since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time but she could not but agree with levin that to fix it for after lent would be put it off too late as an old aunt of prince shtcherbatsky ’s be seriously ill and might die and then the mourning would delay the wedding still long and therefore decide to divide the trousseau into two part — a large and small trousseau — the princess consent to have the wedding before lent she determine that she would get the small part of the trousseau all ready now and the large part should be make later and she be much vexed with levin because he be incapable of give she a serious answer to the question whether he agree to this arrangement or not the arrangement be the more suitable as immediately after the wedding the young people be to go to the country where the more important part of the trousseau would not be want levin still continue in the same delirious condition in which it seem to he that he and his happiness constitute the chief and sole aim of all existence and that he need not now think or care about anything that everything be be do and would be do for he by other he have not even plan and aim for the future he leave its arrangement to other know that everything would be delightful his brother sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch and the princess guide he in do what he have to do all he do be to agree entirely with everything suggest to he his brother raise money for he the princess advise he to leave moscow after the wedding stepan arkadyevitch advise he to go abroad he agree to everything " do what you choose if it amuse you I ’m happy and my happiness can be no great and no less for anything you do " he think when he tell kitty of stepan arkadyevitch ’s advice that they should go abroad he be much surprised that she do not agree to this and have some definite requirement of her own in regard to their future she know levin have work he love in the country she do not as he see understand this work she do not even care to understand it but that do not prevent she from regard it as a matter of great importance and then she know their home would be in the country and she want to go not abroad where she be not go to live but to the place where their home would be this definitely express purpose astonish levin but since he do not care either way he immediately ask stepan arkadyevitch as though it be his duty to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the good of his ability with the taste of which he have so much " but I say " stepan arkadyevitch say to he one day after he have come back from the country where he have get everything ready for the young people ’s arrival " have you a certificate of have be at confession " " no but what of it " " you can not be marry without it " " aïe aïe aïe " cry levin " why I believe it ’ nine year since I ’ve take the sacrament I never think of it " " you ’re a pretty fellow " say stepan arkadyevitch laugh " and you call I a nihilist but this will not do you know you must take the sacrament " " when there be four day leave now " stepan arkadyevitch arrange this also and levin have to go to confession to levin as to any unbeliever who respect the belief of other it be exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremony at this moment in his present softened state of feeling sensitive to everything this inevitable act of hypocrisy be not merely painful to levin it seem to he utterly impossible now in the heyday of his high glory his full flower he would have to be a liar or a scoffer he feel incapable of be either but though he repeatedly ply stepan arkadyevitch with question as to the possibility of obtain a certificate without actually communicate stepan arkadyevitch maintain that it be out of the question " besides what be it to you — two day and he ’ an awfully nice clever old fellow he ’ll pull the tooth out for you so gently you will not notice it " stand at the first litany levin attempt to revive in himself his youthful recollection of the intense religious emotion he have pass through between the age of sixteen and seventeen but he be at once convinced that it be utterly impossible to he he attempt to look at it all as an empty custom have no sort of meaning like the custom of pay call but he feel that he could not do that either levin find himself like the majority of his contemporary in the vague position in regard to religion believe he could not and at the same time he have no firm conviction that it be all wrong and consequently not be able to believe in the significance of what he be do nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality during the whole period of prepare for the sacrament he be conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at do what he do not himself understand and what as an inner voice tell he be therefore false and wrong during the service he would first listen to the prayer try to attach some meaning to they not discordant with his own view then feel that he could not understand and must condemn they he try not to listen to they but to attend to the thought observation and memory which float through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of stand in church he have stand through the litany the evening service and the midnight service and the next day he get up early than usual and without have tea go at eight o’clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession there be no one in the church but a beggar soldier two old woman and the church official a young deacon whose long back show in two distinct half through his thin undercassock meet he and at once go to a little table at the wall read the exhortation during the reading especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same word " lord have mercy on we " which resound with an echo levin feel that thought be shut and seal up and that it must not be touch or stir now or confusion would be the result and so stand behind the deacon he go on think of his own affair neither listen nor examine what be say " it ’ wonderful what expression there be in her hand " he think remember how they have be sit the day before at a corner table they have nothing to talk about as be almost always the case at this time and lay her hand on the table she keep open and shut it and laugh herself as she watch her action he remember how he have kiss it and then have examine the line on the pink palm " have mercy on we again " think levin cross himself bow and look at the supple spring of the deacon ’s back bow before he " she take my hand then and examine the line ' you ’ve get a splendid hand ' she say " and he look at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon " yes now it will soon be over " he think " no it seem to be begin again " he think listen to the prayer " no it ’ just end there he be bow down to the ground that ’ always at the end " the deacon ’s hand in a plush cuff accept a threerouble note unobtrusively and the deacon say he would put it down in the register and his new boot creak jauntily over the flagstone of the empty church he go to the altar a moment later he peep out thence and beckon to levin think till then lock up begin to stir in levin ’s head but he make haste to drive it away " it will come right somehow " he think and go towards the altarrail he go up the step and turn to the right see the priest the priest a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary goodnatured eye be stand at the altarrail turn over the page of a missal with a slight bow to levin he begin immediately read prayer in the official voice when he have finish they he bow down to the ground and turn face levin " christ be present here unseen receive your confession " he say point to the crucifix " do you believe in all the doctrine of the holy apostolic church " the priest go on turn his eye away from levin ’s face and fold his hand under his stole " I have doubt I doubt everything " say levin in a voice that jar on himself and he cease speak the priest wait a few second to see if he would not say more and close his eye he say quickly with a broad vladimirsky accent " doubt be natural to the weakness of mankind but we must pray that god in his mercy will strengthen we what be your special sin " he add without the slight interval as though anxious not to waste time " my chief sin be doubt I have doubt of everything and for the most part I be in doubt " " doubt be natural to the weakness of mankind " the priest repeat the same word " what do you doubt about principally " " I doubt of everything I sometimes even have doubt of the existence of god " levin could not help say and he be horrify at the impropriety of what he be say but levin ’s word do not it seem make much impression on the priest " what sort of doubt can there be of the existence of god " he say hurriedly with a just perceptible smile levin do not speak " what doubt can you have of the creator when you behold his creation " the priest go on in the rapid customary jargon " who have deck the heavenly firmament with its light who have clothe the earth in its beauty how explain it without the creator " he say look inquiringly at levin levin feel that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest and so he say in reply merely what be a direct answer to the question " I do not know " he say " you do not know then how can you doubt that god create all " the priest say with goodhumored perplexity " I do not understand it at all " say levin blush and feel that his word be stupid and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position " pray to god and beseech he even the holy fathers have doubt and pray to god to strengthen their faith the devil have great power and we must resist he pray to god beseech he pray to god " he repeat hurriedly the priest pause for some time as though meditate " you ’re about I hear to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit prince shtcherbatsky " he resume with a smile " an excellent young lady " " yes " answer levin blush for the priest " what do he want to ask I about this at confession for " he think and as though answer his thought the priest say to he " you be about to enter into holy matrimony and god may bless you with offspring well what sort of bringingup can you give your babe if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil entice you to infidelity " he say with gentle reproachfulness " if you love your child as a good father you will not desire only wealth luxury honor for your infant you will be anxious for his salvation his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth eh what answer will you make he when the innocent babe ask you ' papa who make all that enchant I in this world — the earth the water the sun the flower the grass ' can you say to he ' I do not know ' you can not but know since the lord god in his infinite mercy have reveal it to we or your child will ask you ' what await I in the life beyond the tomb ' what will you say to he when you know nothing how will you answer he will you leave he to the allurement of the world and the devil that ’ not right " he say and he stop put his head on one side and look at levin with his kindly gentle eye levin make no answer this time not because he do not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest but because so far no one have ever ask he such question and when his babe do ask he those question it would be time enough to think about answer they " you be enter upon a time of life " pursue the priest " when you must choose your path and keep to it pray to god that he may in his mercy aid you and have mercy on you " he conclude " our lord and god jesus christ in the abundance and rich of his lovingkindness forgive this child " and finish the prayer of absolution the priest bless he and dismiss he on get home that day levin have a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position be over and have be get through without his have to tell a lie apart from this there remain a vague memory that what the kind nice old fellow have say have not be at all so stupid as he have fancy at first and that there be something in it that must be clear up " of course not now " think levin " but some day later on " levin feel more than ever now that there be something not clear and not clean in his soul and that in regard to religion he be in the same position which he perceive so clearly and dislike in other and for which he blame his friend sviazhsky levin spend that evening with his betrothed at dolly ’s and be in very high spirit to explain to stepan arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he find himself he say that he be happy like a dog be train to jump through a hoop who have at last catch the idea and do what be require of he

holy picture the gilt on the red ground of the holy picturestand and the gilt relief on the picture and the silver of the luster and candlestick and the stone of the floor and the rug and the banner above in the choir and the step of the altar and the old blacken book and the cassock and surplice — all be flood with light on the right side of the warm church in the crowd of frock coat and white tie uniform and broadcloth velvet satin hair and flower bare shoulder and arm and long glove there be discreet but lively conversation that echo strangely in the high cupola every time there be hear the creak of the open door the conversation in the crowd die away and everybody look round expect to see the bride and bridegroom come in but the door have open more than ten time and each time it be either a belated guest or guest who join the circle of the invite on the right or a spectator who have elude or soften the police officer and go to join the crowd of outsider on the left both the guest and the outside public have by now pass through all the phase of anticipation at first they imagine that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately and attach no importance at all to their be late then they begin to look more and more often towards the door and to talk of whether anything could have happen then the long delay begin to be positively discomforting and relation and guest try to look as if they be not think of the bridegroom but be engross in conversation the head deacon as though to remind they of the value of his time cough impatiently make the windowpane quiver in their frame in the choir the bored chorister could be hear try their voice and blow their nose the priest be continually send first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom have not come more and more often he go himself in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash to the side door expect to see the bridegroom at last one of the lady glance at her watch say " it really be strange though " and all the guest become uneasy and begin loudly express their wonder and dissatisfaction one of the bridegroom ’s good man go to find out what have happen kitty meanwhile have long ago be quite ready and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossom she be stand in the drawingroom of the shtcherbatskys ' house with her sister madame lvova who be her bridalmother she be look out of the window and have be for over half an hour anxiously expect to hear from the good man that her bridegroom be at the church levin meanwhile in his trouser but without his coat and waistcoat be walk to and fro in his room at the hotel continually put his head out of the door and look up and down the corridor but in the corridor there be no sign of the person he be look for and he come back in despair and frantically wave his hand address stepan arkadyevitch who be smoke serenely " be ever a man in such a fearful fool ’s position " he say " yes it be stupid " stepan arkadyevitch assent smile soothingly " but do not worry it ’ll be bring directly " " no what be to be do " say levin with smothered fury " and these fool of open waistcoat out of the question " he say look at the crumpled front of his shirt " and what if the thing have be take on to the railway station " he roar in desperation " then you must put on mine " " I ought to have do so long ago if at all " " it ’ not nice to look ridiculous wait a bit it will come round " the point be that when levin ask for his evening suit kouzma his old servant have bring he the coat waistcoat and everything that be want " but the shirt " cry levin " you ’ve get a shirt on " kouzma answer with a placid smile kouzma have not think of leave out a clean shirt and on receive instruction to pack

church while he be pace up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage peep out into the corridor and with horror and despair recall what absurd thing he have say to kitty and what she might be think now at last the guilty kouzma fly pant into the room with the shirt " only just in time they be just lift it into the van " say kouzma three minute later levin run full speed into the corridor not look at his watch for fear of aggravate his suffering " you will not help matter like this " say stepan arkadyevitch with a smile hurry with more deliberation after he " it will come round it will

his eye off his bride everyone say she have lose her look dreadfully of late and be not nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual but levin do not think so he look at her hair do up high with the long white veil and white flower and the high standup scalloped collar that in such a maidenly fashion hide her long neck at the side and only show it in front her strikingly slender figure and it seem to he that she look well than ever — not because these flower this veil this gown from paris add anything to her beauty but because in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire the expression of her sweet face of her eye of her lip be still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness " I be begin to think you mean to run away " she say and smile to he " it ’ so stupid what happen to I I ’m ashamed to speak of it " he say redden and he be oblige to turn to sergey ivanovitch who come up to he " this be a pretty story of yours about the shirt " say sergey ivanovitch shake his head and smile " yes yes " answer levin without an idea of what they be talk about " now kostya you have to decide " say stepan arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay " a weighty question you be at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity they ask I be they to light the candle that have be light before or candle that have never be light it ’ a matter of ten rouble " he add relax his lip into a smile " I have decide but I be afraid you might not agree " levin see it be a joke but he could not smile " well how ’ it to be then — unlighted or light candle that ’ the question " " yes yes unlighted " " oh I ’m very glad the question ’ decide " say stepan arkadyevitch smile " how silly man be though in this position " he say to tchirikov when levin after look absently at he have move back to his bride " kitty mind you ’re the first to step on the carpet " say countess nordston come up " you ’re a nice person " she say to levin " be not you frightened eh " say marya dmitrievna an old aunt " be you cold you ’re pale stop a minute stoop down " say kitty ’s sister madame lvova and with her plump handsome arm she smilingly set straight the flower on her head dolly come up try to say something but could not speak cry and then laugh unnaturally kitty look at all of they with the same absent eye as levin meanwhile the officiate clergy have get into their vestment and the priest and deacon come out to the lectern which stand in the forepart of the church the priest turn to levin say something levin do not hear what the priest say " take the bride ’s hand and lead she up " the good man say to levin it be a long while before levin could make out what be expect of he for a long time they try to set he right and make he begin again — because he keep take kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm — till he understand at last that what he have to do be without change his position to take her right hand in his right hand when at last he have take the bride ’s hand in the correct way the priest walk a few pace in front of they and stop at the lectern the crowd of friend and relation move after they with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirt someone stoop down and pull out the bride ’s train the church become so still that the drop of wax could be hear fall from the candle the little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap with his long silverygray lock of hair part behind his ear be fumble with something at the lectern put out his little old hand from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it stepan arkadyevitch approach he cautiously whisper something and make a sign to levin walk back again the priest light two candle wreathe with flower and hold they sideways so that the wax drop slowly from they he turn face the bridal pair the priest be the same old man that have confess levin he look with weary and melancholy eye at the bride and bridegroom sigh and put his right hand out from his vestment bless the bridegroom with it and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness lay the crossed finger on the bowed head of kitty then he give they the candle and take the censer move slowly away from they " can it be true " think levin and he look round at his bride look down at she he see her face in profile and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lip and eyelash he know she be aware of his eye upon she she do not look round but the high scalloped collar that reach her little pink ear tremble faintly he see that a sigh be hold back in her throat and the little hand in the long glove shake as it hold the candle all the fuss of the shirt of be late all the talk of friend and relation their annoyance his ludicrous position — all suddenly pass away and he be fill with joy and dread the handsome stately headdeacon wear a silver robe and his curly lock stand out at each side of his head step smartly forward and lift his stole on two finger stand opposite the priest " blessed be the name of the lord " the solemn syllable ring out slowly one after another set the air quiver with wave of sound " blessed be the name of our god from the beginning be now and ever shall be " the little old priest answer in a submissive piping voice still finger something at the lectern and the full chorus of the unseen choir rise up fill the whole church from the window to the vaulted roof with broad wave of melody it grow strong rest for an instant and slowly die away they pray as they always do for peace from on high and for salvation for the holy synod and for the tsar they pray too for the servant of god konstantin and ekaterina now plight their troth " vouchsafe to they love make perfect peace and help o lord we beseech thee " the whole church seem to breathe with the voice of the head deacon levin hear the word and they impress he " how do they guess that it be help just help that one want " he think recall all his fear and doubt of late " what do I know what can I do in this fearful business " he think " without help yes it be help I want now " when the deacon have finish the prayer for the imperial family the priest turn to the bridal pair with a book " eternal god that joinest together in love they that be separate " he read in a gentle piping voice " who hast ordain the union of holy wedlock that can not be set asunder thou who didst bless isaac and rebecca and their descendant accord to thy holy covenant bless thy servant konstantin and ekaterina lead they in the path of all good work for gracious and merciful art thou our lord and glory be to thee the father the son and the holy ghost now and ever shall be " " amen " the unseen choir send roll again upon the air " ' joinest together in love they that be separate ' what deep meaning in those word and how they correspond with what one feel at this moment " think levin " be she feel the same as I " and look round he meet her eye and from their expression he conclude that she be understand it just as he be but this be a mistake she almost completely miss the meaning of the word of the service she have not hear they in fact she could not listen to they and take they in so strong be the one feeling that fill her breast and grow strong and strong that feeling be joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half have be go on in her soul and have during those six week be a joy and a torture to she on the day when in the drawingroom of the house in arbaty street she have go up to he in her brown dress and give herself to he without a word — on that day at that hour there take place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life and a quite different new utterly strange life have begin for she while the old life be actually go on as before those six week have for she be a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost you all her life all her desire and hope be concentrate on this one man still uncomprehended by she to whom she be bind by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion even less comprehended than the man himself and all the while she be go on live in the outward condition of her old life live the old life she be horrify at herself at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past to thing to habit to the people she have love who love she — to her mother who be wound by her indifference to her kind tender father till then dear than all the world at one moment she be horrify at this indifference at another she rejoice at what have bring she to this indifference she could not frame a thought not a wish apart from life with this man but this new life be not yet and she could not even picture it clearly to herself there be only anticipation the dread and joy of the new and the unknown and now behold — anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life — all be end and the new be begin this new life could not but have terror for her inexperience but terrible or not the change have be work six week before in her soul and this be merely the final sanction of what have long be complete in her heart turn again to the lectern the priest with some difficulty take kitty ’s little ring and ask levin for his hand put it on the first joint of his finger " the servant of god konstantin plight his troth to the servant of god ekaterina " and put his big ring on kitty ’s touchingly weak pink little finger the priest say the same thing and the bridal pair try several time to understand what they have to do and each time make some mistake and be correct by the priest in a whisper at last have duly perform the ceremony have sign the ring with the cross the priest hand kitty the big ring and levin the little one again they be puzzled and pass the ring from hand to hand still without do what be expect dolly tchirikov and stepan arkadyevitch step forward to set they right there be an interval of hesitation whispering and smile but the expression of solemn emotion on the face of the betroth pair do not change on the contrary in their perplexity over their hand they look more grave and deeply moved than before and the smile with which stepan arkadyevitch whisper to they that now they would each put on their own ring die away on his lip he have a feeling that any smile would jar on they " thou who didst from the beginning create male and female " the priest read after the exchange of ring " from thee woman be give to man to be a helpmeet to he and for the procreation of child o lord our god who hast pour down the blessing of thy truth accord to thy holy covenant upon thy choose servant our father from generation to generation bless thy servant konstantin and ekaterina and make their troth fast in faith and union of heart and truth and love " levin feel more and more that all his idea of marriage all his dream of how he would order his life be mere childishness and that it be something he have not understand hitherto and now understand less than ever though it be be perform upon he the lump in his throat rise higher and high tear that would not be check come into his eye in the church there be all moscow all the friend and relation and during the ceremony of plighting troth in the brilliantly light church there be an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dress woman and girl and man in white tie frockcoat and uniform the talk be principally keep up by the man while the woman be absorb in watch every detail of the ceremony which always mean so much to they in the little group near to the bride be her two sister dolly and the other one the selfpossessed beauty madame lvova who have just arrive from abroad " why be it marie ’ in lilac as bad as black at a wedding " say madame korsunskaya " with her complexion it ’ the one salvation " respond madame trubetskaya " I wonder why they have the wedding in the evening it ’ like shoppeople " " so much pretty I be marry in the evening too " answer madame

have be travel for three month together in europe they have visit venice rome and naples and have just arrive at a small italian town where they mean to stay some time a handsome head waiter with thick pomaded hair part from the neck upwards an evening coat a broad white cambric shirt front and a bunch of trinket hang above his rounded stomach stand with his hand in the full curve of his pocket look contemptuously from under his eyelid while he give some frigid reply to a gentleman who have stop he catch the sound of footstep come from the other side of the entry towards the staircase the head waiter turn round and see the russian count who have take their good room he take his hand out of his pocket deferentially and with a bow inform he that a courier have be and that the business about the palazzo have be arrange the steward be prepared to sign the agreement " ah I ’m glad to hear it " say vronsky " be madame at home or not " " madame have be out for a walk but have return now " answer the waiter vronsky take off his soft widebrimmed hat and pass his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair which have grow half over his ear and be brush back cover the bald patch on his head and glance casually at the gentleman who still stand there gaze intently at he he would have go on " this gentleman be a russian and be inquire after you " say the head waiter with mingled feeling of annoyance at never be able to get away from acquaintance anywhere and long to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life vronsky look once more at the gentleman who have retreat and stand still again and at the same moment a light come into the eye of both " golenishtchev " " vronsky " it really be golenishtchev a comrade of vronsky ’s in the corps of page in the corps golenishtchev have belong to the liberal party he leave the corps without enter the army and have never take office under the government vronsky and he have go completely different way on leave the corps and have only meet once since at that meeting vronsky perceive that golenishtchev have take up a sort of lofty intellectually liberal line and be consequently disposed to look down upon vronsky ’s interest and call in life hence vronsky have meet he with the chilling and haughty manner he so well know how to assume the meaning of which be " you may like or dislike my way of life that ’ a matter of the most perfect indifference to I you will have to treat I with respect if you want to know I " golenishtchev have be contemptuously indifferent to the tone take by vronsky this second meeting might have be expect one would have suppose to estrange they still more but now they beam and exclaim with delight on recognize one another vronsky would never have expect to be so pleased to see golenishtchev but probably he be not himself aware how bored he be he forget the disagreeable impression of their last meeting and with a face of frank delight hold out his hand to his old comrade the same expression of delight replace the look of uneasiness on golenishtchev ’s face " how glad I be to meet you " say vronsky show his strong white tooth in a friendly smile " I hear the name vronsky but I do not know which one I ’m very very glad " " let ’s go in come tell I what you ’re do " " I ’ve be live here for two year I ’m work " " ah " say vronsky with sympathy " let ’s go in " and with the habit common with russians instead of say in russian what he want to keep from the servant he begin to speak in french " do you know madame karenina we be travel together I be go to see she now " he say in french carefully scrutinize golenishtchev ’s face " ah I do not know " though he do know golenishtchev answer carelessly " have you be here long " he add " four day " vronsky answer once more scrutinize his friend ’s face intently " yes he ’ a decent fellow and will look at the thing properly " vronsky say to himself catch the significance of golenishtchev ’s face and the change of subject " I can introduce he to anna he look at it properly " during those three month that vronsky have spend abroad with anna he have always on meet new people ask himself how the new person would look at his relation with anna and for the most part in man he have meet with the " proper " way of look at it but if he have be ask and those who look at it " properly " have be ask exactly how they do look at it both he and they would have be greatly puzzle to answer in reality those who in vronsky ’s opinion have the " proper " view have no sort of view at all but behave in general as wellbred person do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problem with which life be encompass on all side they behave with propriety avoid allusion and unpleasant question they assume an air of fully comprehend the import and force of the situation of accept and even approve of it but of consider it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into word vronsky at once divine that golenishtchev be of this class and therefore be doubly pleased to see he and in fact golenishtchev ’s manner to madame karenina when he be take to call on she be all that vronsky could have desire obviously without the slight effort he steer clear of all subject which might lead to embarrassment he have never meet anna before and be strike by her beauty and still more by the frankness with which she accept her position she blush when vronsky bring in golenishtchev and he be extremely charm by this childish blush overspread her candid and handsome face but what he like particularly be the way in which at once as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider she call vronsky simply alexey and say they be move into a house they have just take what be here call a palazzo golenishtchev like this direct and simple attitude to her own position look at anna ’s manner of simplehearted spirited gaiety and know alexey alexandrovitch and vronsky golenishtchev fancy that he understand she perfectly he fancy that he understand what she be utterly unable to understand how it be that have make her husband wretched have abandon he and her son and lose her good name she yet feel full of spirit gaiety and happiness " it ’ in the guidebook " say golenishtchev refer to the palazzo vronsky have take " there ’ a firstrate tintoretto there one of his late period " " I tell you what it ’ a lovely day let ’s go and have another look at it " say vronsky address anna " I shall be very glad to I ’ll go and put on my hat would you say it ’ hot " she say stop short in the doorway and look inquiringly at vronsky and again a vivid flush overspread her face vronsky see from her eye that she do not know on what term he care to be with golenishtchev and so be afraid of not behave as he would wish he look a long tender look at she " no not very " he say and it seem to she that she understand everything most of all that he be pleased with she and smile to he she walk with her rapid step out at the door the friend glance at one another and a look of hesitation come into both face as though golenishtchev unmistakably admire she would have like to say something about she and could not find the right thing to say while vronsky desire and dread his do so " well then " vronsky begin to start a conversation of some sort " so you ’re settle here you ’re still at the same work then " he go on recall that he have be tell golenishtchev be write something " yes I ’m write the second part of the two element " say golenishtchev color with pleasure at the question—“that be to be exact I be not write it yet I be prepare collect material it will be of far wide scope and will touch on almost all question we in russia refuse to see that we be the heir of byzantium " and he launch into a long and heated explanation of his view vronsky at the first moment feel embarrassed at not even know of the first part of the two element of which the author speak as something well know but as golenishtchev begin to lay down his opinion and vronsky be able to follow they even without know the two element he listen to he with some interest for golenishtchev speak well but vronsky be startle and annoy by the nervous irascibility with which golenishtchev talk of the subject that engross he as he go on talk his eye glitter more and more angrily he be more and more hurried in his reply to imaginary opponent and his face grow more and more excited and worried remember golenishtchev a thin lively goodnatured and wellbred boy always at the head of the class vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability and he do not like it what he particularly dislike be that golenishtchev a man belong to a good set should put himself on a level with some scribble fellow with whom he be irritated and angry be it worth it vronsky dislike it yet he feel that golenishtchev be unhappy and be sorry for he unhappiness almost mental derangement be visible on his mobile rather handsome face while without even notice anna ’s come in he go on hurriedly and hotly express his view when anna come in in her hat and cape and her lovely hand rapidly swinge her parasol and stand beside he it be with a feeling of relief that vronsky break away from the plaintive eye of golenishtchev which fasten persistently upon he and with a fresh rush of love look at his charming companion full of life and happiness golenishtchev recover himself with an effort and at first be dejected and gloomy but anna disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she be at that time soon revive his spirit by her direct and lively manner after try various subject of conversation she get he upon painting of which he talk very well and she listen to he attentively they walk to the house they have take and look over it " I be very glad of one thing " say anna to golenishtchev when they be on their way back " alexey will have a capital atelier you must certainly take that room " she say to vronsky in russian use the affectionately familiar form as though she see that golenishtchev would become intimate with they in their isolation and that there be no need of reserve before he " do you paint " say golenishtchev turn round quickly to vronsky " yes I use to study long ago and now I have begin to do a little " say vronsky redden " he have great talent " say anna with a delighted smile " I ’m no judge of course but good judge have say the same " anna in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to health feel herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life the thought of her husband ’s unhappiness do not poison her happiness on one side that memory be too awful to be think of on the other side her husband ’s unhappiness have give she too much happiness to be regret the memory of all that have happen after her illness her reconciliation with her husband its breakdown the news of vronsky ’s wind his visit the preparation for divorce the departure from her husband ’s house the parting from her son — all that seem to she like a delirious dream from which she have wake up alone with vronsky abroad the thought of the harm cause to her husband arouse in she a feeling like repulsion and akin to what a drown man might feel who have shake off another man cling to he that man do drown it be an evil action of course but it be the sole means of escape and well not to brood over these fearful fact one consolatory reflection upon her conduct have occur to she at the first moment of the final rupture and when now she recall all the past she remember that one reflection " I have inevitably make that man wretched " she think " but I do not want to profit by his misery I too be suffer and shall suffer I be lose what I prize above everything — I be lose my good name and my son I have do wrong and so I do not want happiness I do not want a divorce and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child " but however sincerely anna have mean to suffer she be not suffer shame there be not with the tact of which both have such a large share they have succeed in avoid russian lady abroad and so have never place themselves in a false position and everywhere they have meet people who pretend that they perfectly understand their position far well indeed than they do themselves separation from the son she love — even that do not cause she anguish in these early day the baby girl — his child — be so sweet and have so win anna ’s heart since she be all that be leave she that anna rarely think of her son the desire for life wax strong with recover health be so intense and the condition of life be so new and pleasant that anna feel unpardonably happy the more she get to know vronsky the more she love he she love he for himself and for his love for she her complete ownership of he be a continual joy to she his presence be always sweet to she all the trait of his character which she learn to know well and well be unutterably dear to she his appearance change by his civilian dress be as fascinating to she as though she be some young girl in love in everything he say think and do she see something particularly noble and elevate her adoration of he alarm she indeed she seek and could not find in he anything not fine she dare not show he her sense of her own insignificance beside he it seem to she that know this he might soon cease to love she and she dread nothing now so much as lose his love though she have no ground for fear it but she could not help be grateful to he for his attitude to she and show that she appreciate it he who have in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career in which he would have be certain to play a leading part — he have sacrifice his ambition for her sake and never betray the slight regret he be more lovingly respectful to she than ever and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never desert he for a single instant he so manly a man never oppose she have indeed with she no will of his own and be anxious it seem for nothing but to anticipate her wish and she could not but appreciate this even though the very intensity of his solicitude for she the atmosphere of care with which he surround she sometimes weigh upon her vronsky meanwhile in spite of the complete realization of what he have so long desire be not perfectly happy he soon feel that the realization of his desire give he no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he have expect it show he the mistake man make in picture to themselves happiness as the realization of their desire for a time after join his life to hers and put on civilian dress he have feel all the delight of freedom in general of which he have know nothing before and of freedom in his love — and he be content but not for long he be soon aware that there be spring up in his heart a desire for desire — ennui without conscious intention he begin to clutch at every pass caprice take it for a desire and an object sixteen hour of the day must be occupy in some way since they be live abroad in complete freedom outside the condition of social life which fill up time in petersburg as for the amusement of bachelor existence which have provide vronsky with entertainment on previous tour abroad they could not be think of since the sole attempt of the sort have lead to a sudden attack of depression in anna quite out of proportion with the cause — a late supper with bachelor friend relation with the society of the place — foreign and russian — be equally out of the question owe to the irregularity of their position the inspection of object of interest apart from the fact that everything have be see already have not for vronsky a russian and a sensible man the immense significance englishmen be able to attach to that pursuit and just as the hungry stomach eagerly accept every object it can get hope to find nourishment in it vronsky quite unconsciously clutch first at politic then at new book and then at picture as he have from a child a taste for painting and as not know what to spend his money on he have begin collect engraving he come to a stop at painting begin to take interest in it and concentrate upon it the unoccupied mass of desire which demand satisfaction he have a ready appreciation of art and probably with a taste for imitate art he suppose himself to have the real thing essential for an artist and after hesitate for some time which style of painting to select — religious historical realistic or genre painting — he set to work to paint he appreciate all kind and could have feel inspire by anyone of they but he have no conception of the possibility of know nothing at all of any school of painting and of be inspire directly by what be within the soul without care whether what be paint will belong to any recognize school since he know nothing of this and draw his inspiration not directly from life but indirectly from life embody in art his inspiration come very quickly and easily and as quickly and easily come his success in paint something very similar to the sort of painting he be try to imitate more than any other style he like the french — graceful and effective — and in that style he begin to paint anna ’s portrait in italian costume and the portrait seem to he and to everyone who see it extremely successful the old neglected palazzo with its lofty carve ceiling and fresco on the wall with its floor of mosaic with its heavy yellow stuff curtain on the window with its vase on pedestal and its open fireplace its carved door and gloomy reception room hang with picture — this palazzo do much by its very appearance after they have move into it to confirm in vronsky the agreeable illusion that he be not so much a russian country gentleman a retire army officer as an enlightened amateur and patron of the art himself a modest artist who have renounce the world his connection and his ambition for the sake of the woman he love the pose choose by vronsky with their removal into the palazzo be completely successful and have through golenishtchev make acquaintance with a few interesting people for a time he be satisfied he paint study from nature under the guidance of an italian professor of painting and study mediæval italian life mediæval italian life so fascinate vronsky that he even wear a hat and fling a cloak over his shoulder in the mediæval style which indeed be extremely become to he " here we live and know nothing of what ’ go on " vronsky say to golenishtchev as he come to see he one morning " have you see mihailov ’s picture " he say hand he a russian gazette he have receive that morning and point to an article on a russian artist live in the very same town and just finish a picture which have long be talk about and have be buy beforehand the article reproach the government and the academy for let so remarkable an artist be leave without encouragement and support " I ’ve see it " answer golenishtchev " of course he ’ not without talent but it ’ all in a wrong direction it ’ all the ivanovstraussrenan attitude to christ and to religious painting " " what be the subject of the picture " ask anna " christ before pilate christ be represent as a jew with all the realism of the new school " and the question of the subject of the picture have bring he to one of his favorite theory golenishtchev launch forth into a disquisition on it " I can not understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake christ always have his definite embodiment in the art of the great master and therefore if they want to depict not god but a revolutionist or a sage let they take from history a socrates a franklin a charlotte corday but not christ they take the very figure which can not be take for their art and then " " and be it true that this mihailov be in such poverty " ask vronsky think that as a russian mæcenas it be his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture be good or bad " I should say not he ’ a remarkable portraitpainter have you ever see his portrait of madame vassiltchikova but I believe he do not care about paint any more portrait and so very likely he be in want I maintain that " " could not we ask he to paint a portrait of anna arkadyevna " say vronsky " why mine " say anna " after yours I do not want another portrait well have one of annie " so she call her baby girl " here she be " she add look out of the window at the handsome italian nurse who be carry the child out into the garden and immediately glance unnoticed at vronsky the handsome nurse from whom vronsky be paint a head for his picture be the one hide grief in anna ’s life he paint with she as his model admire her beauty and mediævalism and anna dare not confess to herself that she be afraid of become jealous of this nurse and be for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to she and her little son vronsky too glance out of the window and into anna ’s eye and turn at once to golenishtchev he say " do you know this mihailov " " I have meet he but he ’ a queer fish and quite without breed you know one of those uncouth new people one ’ so often come across nowadays one of those freethinker you know who be rear d’emblée in theory of atheism scepticism and materialism in former day " say golenishtchev not observe or not willing to observe that both anna and vronsky want to speak " in former day the freethinker be a man who have be bring up in idea of religion law and morality and only through conflict and struggle come to freethought but now there have spring up a new type of bear freethinker who grow up without even have hear of principle of morality or of religion of the existence of authority who grow up directly in idea of negation in everything that be to say savage well he ’ of that class he ’ the son it appear of some moscow butler and have never have any sort of bringingup when he get into the academy and make his reputation he try as he ’ no fool to educate himself and he turn to what seem to he the very source of culture — the magazine in old time you see a man who want to educate himself — a frenchman for instance — would have set to work to you all the classic and theologian and tragedian and historian and philosopher and you know all the intellectual work that come in his way but in our day he go straight for the literature of negation very quickly assimilate all the extract of the science of negation and he ’ ready and that ’ not all — twenty year ago he would have find in that literature trace of conflict with authority with the creed of the age he would have perceive from this conflict that there be something else but now he come at once upon a literature in which the old creed do not even furnish matter for discussion but it be state baldly that there be nothing else — evolution natural selection struggle for existence — and that ’ all in my article I ’ve " " I tell you what " say anna who have for a long while be exchange wary glance with vronsky and know that he be not in the least interested in the education of this artist but be simply absorb by the idea of assist he and order a portrait of he " I tell you what " she say resolutely interrupt golenishtchev who be still talk away " let ’s go and see he " golenishtchev recover his selfpossession and readily agree but as the artist live in a remote suburb it be decide to take the carriage an hour later anna with golenishtchev by her side and vronsky on the front seat of the carriage face they drive up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb on learn from the porter ’s wife who come out to they that mihailov see visitor at his studio but that at that moment he be in his lodging only a couple of step off they send she to he with their card ask permission to see his picture the artist mihailov be as always at work when the card of count vronsky and golenishtchev be bring to he in the morning he have be work in his studio at his big picture on get home he fly into a rage with his wife for not have manage to put off the landlady who have be ask for money " I ’ve say it to you twenty time do not enter into detail you ’re fool enough at all time and when you start explain thing in italian you ’re a fool three time as foolish " he say after a long dispute " do not let it run so long it ’ not my fault if I have the money " " leave I in peace for god ’s sake " mihailov shriek with tear in his voice and stop his ear he go off into his working room the other side of a partition wall and close the door after he " idiotic woman " he say to himself sit down to the table and open a portfolio he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he have begin never do he work with such fervor and success as when thing go ill with he and especially when he quarrel with his wife " oh damn they all " he think as he go on work he be make a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage a sketch have be make before but he be dissatisfied with it " no that one be well   where be it " he go back to his wife and scowl and not look at she ask his eld little girl where be that piece of paper he have give they the paper with the discard sketch on it be find but it be dirty and spotted with candlegrease still he take the sketch lay it on his table and move a little away screw up his eye he fall to gaze at it all at once he smile and gesticulate gleefully " that ’ it that ’ it " he say and at once pick up the pencil he begin rapidly draw the spot of tallow have give the man a new pose he have sketch this new pose when all at once he recall the face of a shopkeeper of whom he have buy cigar a vigorous face with a prominent chin and he sketch this very face this chin on to the figure of the man he laugh aloud with delight the figure from a lifeless imagine thing have become living and such that it could never be change that figure live and be clearly and unmistakably define the sketch might be correct in accordance with the requirement of the figure the leg indeed could and must be put differently and the position of the left hand must be quite alter the hair too might be throw back but in make these correction he be not alter the figure but simply get rid of what conceal the figure he be as it be strip off the wrapping which hinder it from be distinctly see each new feature only bring out the whole figure in all its force and vigor as it have suddenly come to he from the spot of tallow he be carefully finish the figure when the card be bring he " come come " he go in to his wife " come sasha do not be cross " he say smile timidly and affectionately at she " you be to blame I be to blame I ’ll make it all right " and have make peace with his wife he put on an olivegreen overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat and go towards his studio the successful figure he have already forget now he be delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence russians who have come in their carriage of his picture the one that stand now on his easel he have at the bottom of his heart one conviction — that no one have ever paint a picture like it he do not believe that his picture be well than all the picture of raphael but he know that what he try to convey in that picture no one ever have convey this he know positively and have know a long while ever since he have begin to paint it but other people ’s criticism whatever they might be have yet immense consequence in his eye and they agitate he to the depth of his soul any remark the most insignificant that show that the critic see even the tiny part of what he see in the picture agitate he to the depth of his soul he always attribute to his critic a more profound comprehension than he have himself and always expect from they something he do not himself see in the picture and often in their criticism he fancy that he have find this he walk rapidly to the door of his studio and in spite of his excitement he be strike by the soft light on anna ’s figure as she stand in the shade of the entrance listen to golenishtchev who be eagerly tell she something while she evidently want to look round at the artist he be himself unconscious how as he approach they he seize on this impression and absorb it as he have the chin of the shopkeeper who have sell he the cigar and put it away somewhere to be bring out when he want it the visitor not agreeably impress beforehand by golenishtchev ’s account of the artist be still less so by his personal appearance thickset and of middle height with nimble movement with his brown hat olivegreen coat and narrow trouser — though wide trouser have be a long while in fashion — most of all with the ordinariness of his broad face and the combine expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity mihailov make an unpleasant impression " please step in " he say try to look indifferent and go into the passage he take a key out of his pocket and open the door on enter the studio mihailov once more scan his visitor and note down in his imagination vronsky ’s expression too and especially his jaw although his artistic sense be unceasingly at work collect material although he feel a continually increase excitement as the moment of criticize his work draw near he rapidly and subtly form from imperceptible sign a mental image of these three person that fellow golenishtchev be a russian live here mihailov do not remember his surname nor where he have meet he nor what he have say to he he only remember his face as he remember all the face he have ever see but he remember too that it be one of the face lay by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression the abundant hair and very open forehead give an appearance of consequence to the face which have only one expression — a petty childish peevish expression concentrate just above the bridge of the narrow nose vronsky and madame karenina must be mihailov suppose distinguished and wealthy russians know nothing about art like all those wealthy russians but pose as amateur and connoisseur " most likely they ’ve already look at all the antique and now they ’re make the round of the studio of the new people the german humbug and the cracked preraphaelite english fellow and have only come to I to make the point of view complete " he think he be well acquainted with the way dilettanti have the clever they be the bad he find they of look at the work of contemporary artist with the sole object of be in a position to say that art be a thing of the past and that the more one see of the new man the more one see how inimitable the work of the great old master have remain he expect all this he see it all in their face he see it in the careless indifference with which they talk among themselves stare at the lay figure and bust and walk about in leisurely fashion wait for he to uncover his picture but in spite of this while he be turn over his study pull up the blind and take off the sheet he be in intense excitement especially as in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy russians be certain to be beast and fool he like vronsky and still more anna " here if you please " he say move on one side with his nimble gait and point to his picture " it ’ the exhortation to pilate matthew chapter xxvii " he say feel his lip be begin to tremble with emotion he move away and stand behind they for the few second during which the visitor be gaze at the picture in silence mihailov too gaze at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider for those few second he be sure in anticipation that a high juster criticism would be utter by they by those very visitor whom he have be so despising a moment before he forget all he have think about his picture before during the three year he have be paint it he forget all its quality which have be absolutely certain to he — he see the picture with their indifferent new outside eye and see nothing good in it he see in the foreground pilate ’s irritated face and the serene face of christ and in the background the figure of pilate ’s retinue and the face of john watch what be happen every face that with such agony such blunder and correction have grow up within he with its special character every face that have give he such torment and such rapture and all these face so many time transpose for the sake of the harmony of the whole all the shade of color and tone that he have attain with such labor — all of this together seem to he now look at it with their eye the mere vulgarity something that have be do a thousand time over the face dear to he the face of christ the center of the picture which have give he such ecstasy as it unfold itself to he be utterly lose to he when he glance at the picture with their eye he see a wellpainted no not even that — he distinctly see now a mass of defect repetition of those endless christ of titian raphael rubens and the same soldier and pilate it be all common poor and stale and positively badly paint — weak and unequal they would be justified in repeat hypocritically civil speech in the presence of the painter and pity he and laugh at he when they be alone again the silence though it last no more than a minute become too intolerable to he to break it and to show he be not agitated he make an effort and address golenishtchev " I think I ’ve have the pleasure of meet you " he say look uneasily first at anna then at vronsky in fear of lose any shade of their expression " to be sure we meet at rossi ’s do you remember at that soirée when that italian lady recite — the new rachel " golenishtchev answer easily remove his eye without the slight regret from the picture and turn to the artist notice however that mihailov be expect a criticism of the picture he say " your picture have get on a great deal since I see it last time and what strike I particularly now as it do then be the figure of pilate one so know the man a goodnatured capital fellow but an official through and through who do not know what it be he ’ do but I fancy " all mihailov ’s mobile face beam at once his eye sparkle he try to say something but he could not speak for excitement and pretend to be cough low as be his opinion of golenishtchev ’s capacity for understand art trifling as be the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of pilate as an official and offensive as might have seem the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing be say of more serious point mihailov be in an ecstasy of delight at this observation he have himself think about pilate ’s figure just what golenishtchev say the fact that this reflection be but one of million of reflection which as mihailov know for certain would be true do not diminish for he the significance of golenishtchev ’s remark his heart warm to golenishtchev for this remark and from a state of depression he suddenly pass to ecstasy at once the whole of his picture live before he in all the indescribable complexity of everything live mihailov again try to say that that be how he understand pilate but his lip quiver intractably and he could not pronounce the word vronsky and anna too say something in that subdued voice in which partly to avoid hurt the artist ’s feeling and partly to avoid say out loud something silly — so easily say when talk of art — people usually speak at exhibition of picture mihailov fancy that the picture have make an impression on they too he go up to they " how marvelous christ ’s expression be " say anna of all she see she like that expression most of all and she feel that it be the center of the picture and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist " one can see that he be pity pilate " this again be one of the million true reflection that could be find in his picture and in the figure of christ she say that he be pity pilate in christ ’s expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity since there be an expression of love of heavenly peace of readiness for death and a sense of the vanity of word of course there be the expression of an official in pilate and of pity in christ see that one be the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life all this and much more flash into mihailov ’s thought " yes and how that figure be do — what atmosphere one can walk round it " say golenishtchev unmistakably betray by this remark that he do not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure " yes there ’ a wonderful mastery " say vronsky " how those figure in the background stand out there you have technique " he say address golenishtchev allude to a conversation between they about vronsky ’s despair of attain this technique " yes yes marvelous " golenishtchev and anna assent in spite of the excited condition in which he be the sentence about technique have send a pang to mihailov ’s heart and look angrily at vronsky he suddenly scowl he have often hear this word technique and be utterly unable to understand what be understand by it he know that by this term be understand a mechanical facility for paint or draw entirely apart from its subject he have notice often that even in actual praise technique be oppose to essential quality as though one could paint well something that be bad he know that a great deal of attention and care be necessary in take off the covering to avoid injure the creation itself and to take off all the covering but there be no art of painting — no technique of any sort — about it if to a little child or to his cook be reveal what he see it or she would have be able to peel the wrapping off what be see and the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if the line of the subject be not reveal to he first besides he see that if it come to talk about technique it be impossible to praise he for it in all he have paint and repaint he see fault that hurt his eye come from want of care in take off the wrapping — fault he could not correct now without spoil the whole and in almost all the figure and face he see too remnant of the wrapping not perfectly remove that spoil the picture " one thing might be say if you will allow I to make the remark " observe golenishtchev " oh I shall be delighted I beg you " say mihailov with a forced smile " that be that you make he the mangod and not the godman but I know that be what you mean to do " " I can not paint a christ that be not in my heart " say mihailov gloomily " yes but in that case if you will allow I to say what I think your picture be so fine that my observation can not detract from it and besides it be only my personal opinion with you it be different your very motive be different but let we take ivanov I imagine that if christ be bring down to the level of an historical character it would have be well for ivanov to select some other historical subject fresh untouched " " but if this be the great subject present to art " " if one look one would find other but the point be that art can not suffer doubt and discussion and before the picture of ivanov the question arise for the believer and the unbeliever alike ' be it god or be it not god ' and the unity of the impression be destroy " " why so I think that for educate people " say mihailov " the question can not exist " golenishtchev do not agree with this and confound mihailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression be essential to art mihailov be greatly perturbed but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea anna and vronsky have long be exchange glance regret their friend ’s flow of cleverness at last vronsky without wait for the artist walk away to another small picture " oh how exquisite what a lovely thing a gem how exquisite " they cry with one voice " what be it they ’re so pleased with " think mihailov he have positively forget that picture he have paint three year ago he have forget all the agony and the ecstasy he have live through with that picture when for several month it have be the one thought haunt he day and night he have forget as he always forgot the picture he have finish he do not even like to look at it and have only bring it out because he be expect an englishman who want to buy it " oh that ’ only an old study " he say " how fine " say golenishtchev he too with unmistakable sincerity fall under the spell of the picture two boy be angle in the shade of a willowtree the elder have just drop in the hook and be carefully pull the float from behind a bush entirely absorb in what he be do the other a little young be lie in the grass lean on his elbow with his tangled flaxen head in his hand stare at the water with his dreamy blue eye what be he think of the enthusiasm over this picture stir some of the old feeling for it in mihailov but he fear and dislike this waste of feeling for thing past and so even though this praise be grateful to he he try to draw his visitor away to a third picture but vronsky ask whether the picture be for sale to mihailov at that moment excite by visitor it be extremely distasteful to speak of money matter " it be put up there to be sell " he answer scowl gloomily when the visitor have go mihailov sit down opposite the picture of pilate and christ and in his mind go over what have be say and what though not say have be imply by those visitor and strange to say what have have such weight with he while they be there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view suddenly lose all importance for he he begin to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision and be soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility and so of the significance of his picture — a conviction essential to the most intense fervor exclude all other interest — in which alone he could work christ ’s foreshortened leg be not right though he take his palette and begin to work as he correct the leg he look continually at the figure of john in the background which his visitor have not even notice but which he know be beyond perfection when he have finish the leg he want to touch that figure but he feel too much excited for it he be equally unable to work when he be cold and when he be too much affected and see everything too much there be only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration at which work be possible today he be too much agitated he would have cover the picture but he stop hold the cloth in his hand and smile blissfully gaze a long while at the figure of john at last as it be regretfully tear himself away he drop the cloth and exhausted but happy go home vronsky anna and golenishtchev on their way home be particularly lively and cheerful they talk of mihailov and his picture the word talent by which they mean an inborn almost physical aptitude apart from brain and heart and in which they try to find an expression for all the artist have gain from life recur particularly often in their talk as though it be necessary for they to sum up what they have no conception of though they want to talk of it they say that there be no deny his talent but that his talent could not develop for want of education — the common defect of our russian artist but the picture of the boy have imprint itself on their memory and they be continually come back to it " what an exquisite thing how he have succeed in it and how simply he do not even comprehend how good it be yes I must not let it slip I must buy it " say vronsky mihailov sell vronsky his picture and agree to paint a portrait of anna on the day fix he come and begin the work from the fifth sitting the portrait impress everyone especially vronsky not only by its resemblance but by its characteristic beauty it be strange how mihailov could have discover just her characteristic beauty " one need to know and love she as I have love she to discover the very sweet expression of her soul " vronsky think though it be only from this portrait that he have himself learn this sweet expression of her soul but the expression be so true that he and other too fancy they have long know it " I have be struggle on for ever so long without do anything " he say of his own portrait of she " and he just look and paint it that ’ where technique come in " " that will come " be the consoling reassurance give he by golenishtchev in whose view vronsky have both talent and what be most important culture give he a wide outlook on art golenishtchev ’s faith in vronsky ’s talent be prop up by his own need of vronsky ’s sympathy and approval for his own article and idea and he feel that the praise and support must be mutual in another man ’s house and especially in vronsky ’s palazzo mihailov be quite a different man from what he be in his studio he behave with hostile courtesy as though he be afraid of come close to people he do not respect he call vronsky " your excellency " and notwithstanding anna ’s and vronsky ’s invitation he would never stay to dinner nor come except for the sitting anna be even more friendly to he than to other people and be very grateful for her portrait vronsky be more than cordial with he and be obviously interested to know the artist ’s opinion of his picture golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instill sound idea about art into mihailov but mihailov remain equally chilly to all of they anna be aware from his eye that he like look at she but he avoid conversation with she vronsky ’s talk about his painting he meet with stubborn silence and he be as stubbornly silent when he be show vronsky ’s picture he be unmistakably bore by golenishtchev ’s conversation and he do not attempt to oppose he altogether mihailov with his reserved and disagreeable as it be hostile attitude be quite disliked by they as they get to know he well and they be glad when the sitting be over and they be leave with a magnificent portrait in their possession and he give up come golenishtchev be the first to give expression to an idea that have occur to all of they which be that mihailov be simply jealous of vronsky " not envious let we say since he have talent but it annoy he that a wealthy man of the high society and a count too you know you all detest a title can without any particular trouble do as well if not well than he who have devote all his life to it and more than all it ’ a question of culture which he be without " vronsky defend mihailov but at the bottom of his heart he believe it because in his view a man of a different low world would be sure to be envious anna ’s portrait — the same subject paint from nature both by he and by mihailov — ought to have show vronsky the difference between he and mihailov but he do not see it only after mihailov ’s portrait be paint he leave off paint his portrait of anna decide that it be now not need his picture of mediæval life he go on with and he himself and golenishtchev and still more anna think it very good because it be far more like the celebrated picture they know than mihailov ’s picture mihailov meanwhile although anna ’s portrait greatly fascinate he be even more glad than they be when the sitting be over and he have no long to listen to golenishtchev ’s disquisition upon art and could forget about vronsky ’s painting he know that vronsky could not be prevent from amuse himself with painting he know that he and all dilettanti have a perfect right to paint what they like but it be distasteful to he a man could not be prevent from make himself a big wax doll and kiss it but if the man be to come with the doll and sit before a man in love and begin caress his doll as the lover caress the woman he love it would be distasteful to the lover just such a distasteful sensation be what mihailov feel at the sight of vronsky ’s painting he feel it both ludicrous and irritating both pitiable and offensive vronsky ’s interest in painting and the middle age do not last long he have enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture the picture come to a standstill he be vaguely aware that its defect inconspicuous at first would be glaring if he be to go on with it the same experience befall he as golenishtchev who feel that he have nothing to say and continually deceive himself with the theory that his idea be not yet mature that he be work it out and collect material this exasperate and torture golenishtchev but vronsky be incapable of deceive and torture himself and even more incapable of exasperation with his characteristic decision without explanation or apology he simply cease work at painting but without this occupation the life of vronsky and of anna who wonder at his loss of interest in it strike they as intolerably tedious in an italian town the palazzo suddenly seem so obtrusively old and dirty the spot on the curtain the crack in the floor the broken plaster on the cornice become so disagreeably obvious and the everlasting sameness of golenishtchev and the italian professor and the german traveler become so wearisome that they have to make some change they resolve to go to russia to the country in petersburg vronsky intend to arrange a partition of the land with his brother while anna mean to see her son the summer they intend to spend on vronsky ’s great family estate levin have be married three month he be happy but not at all in the way he have expect to be at every step he find his former dream disappoint and new unexpected surprise of happiness he be happy but on enter upon family life he see at every step that it be utterly different from what he have imagine at every step he experience what a man would experience who after admire the smooth happy course of a little boat on a lake should get himself into that little boat he see that it be not all sit still float smoothly that one have to think too not for an instant to forget where one be float and that there be water under one and that one must row and that his unaccustomed hand would be sore and that it be only to look at it that be easy but that do it though very delightful be very difficult as a bachelor when he have watch other people ’s married life see the petty care the squabble the jealousy he have only smile contemptuously in his heart in his future married life there could be he be convince nothing of that sort even the external form indeed he fancy must be utterly unlike the life of other in everything and all of a sudden instead of his life with his wife be make on an individual pattern it be on the contrary entirely make up of the petty detail which he have so despise before but which now by no will of his own have gain an extraordinary importance that it be useless to contend against and levin see that the organization of all these detail be by no means so easy as he have fancy before although levin believe himself to have the most exact conception of domestic life unconsciously like all man he picture domestic life as the happy enjoyment of love with nothing to hinder and no petty care to distract he ought as he conceive the position to do his work and to find repose from it in the happiness of love she ought to be beloved and nothing more but like all man he forget that she too would want work and he be surprised that she his poetic exquisite kitty could not merely in the first week but even in the first day of their married life think remember and busy herself about tablecloth and furniture about mattress for visitor about a tray about the cook and the dinner and so on while they be still engaged he have be strike by the definiteness with which she have decline the tour abroad and decide to go into the country as though she know of something she want and could still think of something outside her love this have jar upon he then and now her trivial care and anxiety jar upon he several time but he see that this be essential for she and love she as he do though he do not understand the reason of they and jeer at these domestic pursuit he could not help admire they he jeer at the way in which she arrange the furniture they have bring from moscow rearrange their room hang up curtain prepare room for visitor a room for dolly see after an abode for her new maid order dinner of the old cook come into collision with agafea mihalovna take from she the charge of the store he see how the old cook smile admire she and listen to her inexperienced impossible order how mournfully and tenderly agafea mihalovna shake her head over the young mistress ’s new arrangement he see that kitty be extraordinarily sweet when laugh and cry she come to tell he that her maid masha be used to look upon she as her young lady and so no one obey she it seem to he sweet but strange and he think it would have be well without this he do not know how great a sense of change she be experience she who at home have sometimes want some favorite dish or sweet without the possibility of get either now could order what she like buy pound of sweet spend as much money as she like and order any pudding she please she be dream with delight now of dolly ’s come to they with her child especially because she would order for the child their favorite pudding and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping she do not know herself why and wherefore but the arranging of her house have an irresistible attraction for she instinctively feel the approach of spring and know that there would be day of rough weather too she build her nest as well she could and be in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it this care for domestic detail in kitty so oppose to levin ’s ideal of exalted happiness be at first one of the disappointment and this sweet care of her household the aim of which he do not understand but could not help love be one of the new happy surprise another disappointment and happy surprise come in their quarrel levin could never have conceive that between he and his wife any relation could arise other than tender respectful and loving and all at once in the very early day they quarrel so that she say he do not care for she that he care for no one but himself burst into tear and wring her arm this first quarrel arise from levin ’s have go out to a new farmhouse and have be away half an hour too long because he have try to get home by a short cut and have lose his way he drive home think of nothing but she of her love of his own happiness and the near he draw to home the warm be his tenderness for she he run into the room with the same feeling with an even strong feeling than he have have when he reach the shtcherbatsky ' house to make his offer and suddenly he be meet by a lower expression he have never see in she he would have kiss she she push he away " what be it " " you ’ve be enjoy yourself " she begin try to be calm and spiteful but as soon as she open her mouth a stream of reproach of senseless jealousy of all that have be torture she during that half hour which she have spend sit motionless at the window burst from she it be only then for the first time that he clearly understand what he have not understand when he lead she out of the church after the wedding he feel now that he be not simply close to she but that he do not know where he end and she begin he feel this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experience at that instant he be offend for the first instant but the very same second he feel that he could not be offend by she that she be himself he feel for the first moment as a man feel when have suddenly receive a violent blow from behind he turn round angry and eager to avenge himself to look for his antagonist and find that it be he himself who have accidentally strike himself that there be no one to be angry with and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain never afterwards do he feel it with such intensity but this first time he could not for a long while get over it his natural feeling urge he to defend himself to prove to she she be wrong but to prove she wrong would mean irritate she still more and make the rupture great that be the cause of all his suffering one habitual feeling impel he to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to she another feeling even strong impel he as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without let it grow great to remain under such undeserved reproach be wretched but to make she suffer by justify himself be bad still like a man halfawake in an agony of pain he want to tear out to fling away the ache place and come to his sense he feel that the ache place be himself he could do nothing but try to help the ache place to bear it and this he try to do they make peace she recognize that she be wrong though she do not say so become tender to he and they experience new redouble happiness in their love but that do not prevent such quarrel from happen again and exceedingly often too on the most unexpected and trivial ground these quarrel frequently arise from the fact that they do not yet know what be of importance to each other and that all this early period they be both often in a bad temper when one be in a good temper and the other in a bad temper the peace be not break but when both happen to be in an illhumor quarrel spring up from such incomprehensibly trifling cause that they could never remember afterwards what they have quarrel about it be true that when they be both in a good temper their enjoyment of life be redouble but still this first period of their married life be a difficult time for they during all this early time they have a peculiarly vivid sense of tension as it be a tugging in opposite direction of the chain by which they be bind altogether their honeymoon — that be to say the month after their wedding — from which from tradition levin expect so much be not merely not a time of sweetness but remain in the memory of both as the bitter and most humiliating period in their life they both alike try in later life to blot out from their memory all the monstrous shameful incident of that morbid period when both be rarely in a normal frame of mind both be rarely quite themselves it be only in the third month of their married life after their return from moscow where they have be stay for a month that their life begin to go more smoothly they have just come back from moscow and be glad to be alone he be sit at the writingtable in his study write she wear the dark lilac dress she have wear during the first day of their married life and put on again today a dress particularly remember and love by he be sit on the sofa the same oldfashioned leather sofa which have always stand in the study in levin ’s father ’s and grandfather ’s day she be sew at broderie anglaise he think and write never lose the happy consciousness of her presence his work both on the land and on the book in which the principle of the new land system be to be lay down have not be abandon but just as formerly these pursuit and idea have seem to he petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life now they seem as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lie before he suffuse with the brilliant light of happiness he go on with his work but he feel now that the center of gravity of his attention have pass to something else and that consequently he look at his work quite differently and more clearly formerly this work have be for he an escape from life formerly he have feel that without this work his life would be too gloomy now these pursuit be necessary for he that life might not be too uniformly bright take up his manuscript read through what he have write he find with pleasure that the work be worth his work at many of his old idea seem to he superfluous and extreme but many blank become distinct to he when he review the whole thing in his memory he be write now a new chapter on the cause of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in russia he maintain that the poverty of russia arise not merely from the anomalous distribution of land property and misdirected reform but that what have contribute of late year to this result be the civilization from without abnormally graft upon russia especially facility of communication as railway lead to centralization in town the development of luxury and the consequent development of manufacture credit and its accompaniment of speculation — all to the detriment of agriculture it seem to he that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomenon would arise only when a considerable amount of labor have be put into agriculture when it have come under regular or at least definite condition that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally and especially in such a way that other source of wealth should not outstrip agriculture that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be mean of communication correspond to it and that in our unsettled condition of the land railway call into being by political and not by economic need be premature and instead of promote agriculture as be expect of they they be compete with agriculture and promote the development of manufacture and credit and so arrest its progress and that just as the onesided and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development so in the general development of wealth in russia credit facility of communication manufacturing activity indubitably necessary in europe where they have arise in their proper time have with we only do harm by throw into the background the chief question call for settlement — the question of the organization of agriculture while he be write his idea she be think how unnaturally cordial her husband have be to young prince tcharsky who have with great want of tact flirt with she the day before they leave moscow " he ’ jealous " she think " goodness how sweet and silly he be he ’ jealous of I if he know that I think no more of they than of piotr the cook " she think look at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself " though it ’ a pity to take he from his work but he have plenty of time I must look at his face will he feel I ’m look at he I wish he ’d turn round   I ’ll will he to " and she open her eye wide as though to intensify the influence of her gaze " yes they draw you all the sap and give a false appearance of prosperity " he mutter stop to write and feel that she be look at he and smile he look round " well " he query smile and get up " he look round " she think " it ’ nothing I want you to look round " she say watch he and try to guess whether he be vex at be interrupt or not " how happy we be alone together — I be that be " he say go up to she with a radiant smile of happiness " I ’m just as happy I ’ll never go anywhere especially not to moscow " " and what be you think about " " I I be think no no go along go on writing do not break off " she say purse up her lip " and I must cut out these little hole now do you see " she take up her scissor and begin cut they out " no tell I what be it " he say sit down beside she and watch the tiny scissor move round " oh what be I think about I be think about moscow about the back of your head " " why should I of all people have such happiness it ’ unnatural too good " he say kiss her hand " I feel quite the opposite the well thing be the more natural it seem to I " " and you ’ve get a little curl loose " he say carefully turn her head round " a little curl oh yes no no we be busy at our work " work do not progress far and they dart apart from one another like culprit when kouzma come in to announce that tea be ready " have they come from the town " levin ask kouzma " they ’ve just come they ’re unpack the thing " " come quickly " she say to he as she go out of the study " or else I shall read your letter without you " leave alone after put his manuscript together in the new portfolio buy by she he wash his hand at the new washstand with the elegant fitting that have all make their appearance with she levin smile at his own thought and shake his head disapprovingly at those thought a feeling akin to remorse fret he there be something shameful effeminate capuan as he call it to himself in his present mode of life " it ’ not right to go on like this " he think " it ’ll soon be three month and I ’m do next to nothing today almost for the first time I set to work seriously and what happen I do nothing but begin and throw it aside even my ordinary pursuit I have almost give up on the land I scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after thing either I be loath to leave she or I see she ’ dull alone and I use to think that before marriage life be nothing much somehow do not count but that after marriage life begin in earnest and here almost three month have pass and I have spend my time so idly and unprofitably no this will not do I must begin of course it ’ not her fault she ’ not to blame in any way I ought myself to be firm to maintain my masculine independence of action or else I shall get into such way and she ’ll get used to they too of course she ’ not to blame " he tell himself but it be hard for anyone who be dissatisfied not to blame someone else and especially the person near of all to he for the ground of his dissatisfaction and it vaguely come into levin ’s mind that she herself be not to blame she could not be to blame for anything but what be to blame be her education too superficial and frivolous " that fool tcharsky she want I know to stop he but do not know how to " " yes apart from her interest in the house that she have apart from dress and broderie anglaise she have no serious interest no interest in her work in the estate in the peasant nor in music though she ’ rather good at it nor in reading she do nothing and be perfectly satisfied " levin in his heart censure this and do not as yet understand that she be prepare for that period of activity which be to come for she when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house and would bear and nurse and bring up child he know not that she be instinctively aware of this and prepare herself for this time of terrible toil do not reproach herself for the moment of carelessness

to soothe she but she do not heed he and would not agree to anything he bend down to she and take her hand which resist he he kiss her hand kiss her hair kiss her hand again — still she be silent but when he take her face in both his hand and say " kitty " she suddenly recover herself and begin to cry and they be reconcile it be decide that they should go together the next day levin tell his wife that he believe she want to go simply in order to be of use agree that marya nikolaevna ’s be with his brother do not make she go improper but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied both with she and with himself he be dissatisfied with she for be unable to make up her mind to let he go when it be necessary and how strange it be for he to think that he so lately hardly dare to believe in such happiness as that she could love he — now be unhappy because she love he too much and he be dissatisfied with himself for not show more strength of will even great be the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to she not need to consider the woman who be with his brother and he think with horror of all the contingency they might meet with the mere idea of his wife his kitty be in the same room with a common wench set he shudder with horror and loathe the hotel of the provincial town where nikolay levin be lie ill be one of those provincial hotel which be construct on the new model of modern improvement with the good intention of cleanliness comfort and even elegance but owe to the public that patronize they be with astounding rapidity transform into filthy tavern with a pretension of modern improvement that only make they bad than the oldfashioned honestly filthy hotel this hotel have already reach that stage and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoke in the entry suppose to stand for a hallporter and the castiron slippery dark and disagreeable staircase and the free and easy waiter in a filthy frock coat and the common diningroom with a dusty bouquet of wax flower adorn the table and filth dust and disorder everywhere and at the same time the sort of modern uptodate selfcomplacent railway uneasiness of this hotel arouse a most painful feeling in levin after their fresh young life especially because the impression of falsity make by the hotel be so out of keeping with what await they as be invariably the case after they have be ask at what price they want room it appear that there be not one decent room for they one decent room have be take by the inspector of railroad another by a lawyer from moscow a third by princess astafieva from the country there remain only one filthy room next to which they promise that another should be empty by the evening feel angry with his wife because what he have expect have come to pass which be that at the moment of arrival when his heart throb with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother be get on he should have to be see after she instead of rush straight to his brother levin conduct she to the room assign they " go do go " she say look at he with timid and guilty eye he go out of the door without a word and at once stumble over marya nikolaevna who have hear of his arrival and have not dare to go in to see he she be just the same as when he see she in moscow the same woolen gown and bare arm and neck and the same goodnaturedly stupid pockmarked face only a little plump " well how be he how be he " " very bad he can not get up he have keep expect you he be you   with your wife " levin do not for the first moment understand what it be confuse she but she immediately enlighten he " I ’ll go away I ’ll go down to the kitchen " she bring out " nikolay dmitrievitch will be delighted he hear about it and know your lady and remember she abroad " levin realize that she mean his wife and do not know what answer to make " come along come along to he " he say but as soon as he move the door of his room open and kitty peep out levin crimson both from shame and anger with his wife who have put herself and he in such a difficult position but marya nikolaevna crimson still more she positively shrink together and flush to the point of tear and clutch the end of her apron in both hand twist they in her red finger without know what to say and what to do for the first instant levin see an expression of eager curiosity in the eye with which kitty look at this awful woman so incomprehensible to she but it last only a single instant " well how be he " she turn to her husband and then to she " but one can not go on talk in the passage like this " levin say look angrily at a gentleman who walk jauntily at that instant across the corridor as though about his affair " well then come in " say kitty turn to marya nikolaevna who have recover herself but notice her husband ’s face of dismay " or go on go and then come for I " she say and go back into the room levin go to his brother ’s room he have not in the least expect what he see and feel in his brother ’s room he have expect to find he in the same state of selfdeception which he have hear be so frequent with the consumptive and which have strike he so much during his brother ’s visit in the autumn he have expect to find the physical sign of the approach of death more marked — great weakness great emaciation but still almost the same condition of thing he have expect himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he love and the same horror in face of death as he have feel then only in a great degree and he have prepare himself for this but he find something utterly different in a little dirty room with the paint panel of its wall filthy with spittle and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room in a stifling atmosphere saturate with impurity on a bedstead move away from the wall there lie cover with a quilt a body one arm of this body be above the quilt and the wrist huge as a rakehandle be attach inconceivably it seem to the thin long bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle the head lie sideways on the pillow levin could see the scanty lock wet with sweat on the temple and tense transparentlooking forehead " it can not be that that fearful body be my brother nikolay " think levin but he go close see the face and doubt become impossible in spite of the terrible change in the face levin have only to glance at those eager eye raise at his approach only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache to realize the terrible truth that this deathlike body be his live brother the glittering eye look sternly and reproachfully at his brother as he draw near and immediately this glance establish a live relationship between live man levin immediately feel the reproach in the eye fix on he and feel remorse at his own happiness when konstantin take he by the hand nikolay smile the smile be faint scarcely perceptible and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eye be unchanged " you do not expect to find I like this " he articulate with effort " yes   no " say levin hesitate over his word " how be it you do not let I know before that be at the time of my wedding I make inquiry in all direction " he have to talk so as not to be silent and he do not know what to say especially as his brother make no reply and simply stare without drop his eye and evidently penetrate to the inner meaning of each word levin tell his brother that his wife have come with he nikolay express pleasure but say he be afraid of frighten she by his condition a silence follow suddenly nikolay stir and begin to say something levin expect something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face but nikolay begin speak of his health he find fault with the doctor regret he have not a celebrated moscow doctor levin see that he still hope seize the first moment of silence levin get up anxious to escape if only for an instant from his agonizing emotion and say that he would go and fetch his wife " very well and I ’ll tell she to tidy up here it ’ dirty and stinking here I expect marya clear up the room " the sick man say with effort " oh and when you ’ve clear up go away yourself " he add look inquiringly at his brother levin make no answer go out into the corridor he stop short he have say he would fetch his wife but now take stock of the emotion he be feel he decide that he would try on the contrary to persuade she not to go in to the sick man " why should she suffer as I be suffer " he think " well how be he " kitty ask with a frightened face " oh it ’ awful it ’ awful what do you come for " say levin kitty be silent for a few second look timidly and ruefully at her husband then she go up and take he by the elbow with both hand " kostya take I to he it will be easy for we to bear it together you only take I take I to he please and go away " she say " you must understand that for I to see you and not to see he be far more painful there I might be a help to you and to he please let I " she beseech her husband as though the happiness of her life depend on it levin be oblige to agree and regain his composure and completely forget about marya nikolaevna by now he go again in to his brother with kitty step lightly and continually glance at her husband show he a valorous and sympathetic face kitty go into the sickroom and turn without haste noiselessly close the door with inaudible step she go quickly to the sick man ’s bedside and go up so that he have not to turn his head she immediately clasp in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand press it and begin speak with that soft eagerness sympathetic and not jarring which be peculiar to woman " we have meet though we be not acquaint at soden " she say " you never think I be to be your sister " " you would not have recognize I " he say with a radiant smile at her entrance " yes I should what a good thing you let we know not a day have pass that kostya have not mention you and be anxious " but the sick man ’s interest do not last long before she have finish speak there have come back into his face the stern reproachful expression of the die man ’s envy of the living " I be afraid you be not quite comfortable here " she say turn away from his fixed stare and look about the room " we must ask about another room " she say to her husband " so that we might be near " levin could not look calmly at his brother he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence when he go in to the sick man his eye and his attention be unconsciously dim and he do not see and do not distinguish the detail of his brother ’s position he smell the awful odor see the dirt disorder and miserable condition and hear the groan and feel that nothing could be do to help it never enter his head to analyze the detail of the sick man ’s situation to consider how that body be lie under the quilt how those emaciated leg and thigh and spine be lie huddle up and whether they could not be make more comfortable whether anything could not be do to make thing if not well at least less bad it make his blood run cold when he begin to think of all these detail he be absolutely convinced that nothing could be do to prolong his brother ’s life or to relieve his suffering but a sense of his regard all aid as out of the question be feel by the sick man and exasperate he and this make it still more painful for levin to be in the sickroom be agony to he not to be there still bad and he be continually on various pretext go out of the room and come in again because he be unable to remain alone but kitty think and feel and act quite differently on see the sick man she pity he and pity in her womanly heart do not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it arouse in her husband but a desire to act to find out all the detail of his state and to remedy they and since she have not the slight doubt that it be her duty to help he she have no doubt either that it be possible and immediately set to work the very detail the mere thought of which reduce her husband to terror immediately engage her attention she send for the doctor send to the chemist ’s set the maid who have come with she and marya nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub she herself wash up something wash out something else lay something under the quilt something be by her direction bring into the sickroom something else be carry out she herself go several time to her room regardless of the man she meet in the corridor get out and bring in sheet pillow case towel and shirt the waiter who be busy with a party of engineer dine in the dining hall come several time with an irate countenance in answer to her summon and could not avoid carry out her order as she give they with such gracious insistence that there be no evade she levin do not approve of all this he do not believe it would be of any good to the patient above all he fear the patient would be angry at it but the sick man though he seem and be indifferent about it be not angry but only abashed and on the whole as it be interested in what she be do with he come back from the doctor to whom kitty have send he levin on open the door come upon the sick man at the instant when by kitty ’s direction they be change his linen the long white ridge of his spine with the huge prominent shoulder blade and jut rib and vertebra be bare and marya nikolaevna and the waiter be struggle with the sleeve of the night shirt and could not get the long limp arm into it kitty hurriedly close the door after levin be not look that way but the sick man groan and she move rapidly towards he " make haste " she say " oh do not you come " say the sick man angrily " I ’ll do it my myself " " what say " query marya nikolaevna but kitty hear and see he be ashamed and uncomfortable at be naked before she " I ’m not look I ’m not look " she say put the arm in " marya nikolaevna you come this side you do it " she add " please go for I there ’ a little bottle in my small bag " she say turn to her husband " you know in the side pocket bring it please and meanwhile they ’ll finish clear up here " return with the bottle levin find the sick man settle comfortably and everything about he completely change the heavy smell be replace by the smell of aromatic vinegar which kitty with pouting lip and puffedout rosy cheek be squirt through a little pipe there be no dust visible anywhere a rug be lay by the bedside on the table stand medicine bottle and decanter tidily arrange and the linen need be fold up there and kitty ’s broderie anglaise on the other table by the patient ’s bed there be candle and drink and powder the sick man himself wash and comb lay in clean sheet on high raise pillow in a clean nightshirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck and with a new expression of hope look fixedly at kitty the doctor bring by levin and find by he at the club be not the one who have be attend nikolay levin as the patient be dissatisfied with he the new doctor take up a stethoscope and sound the patient shake his head prescribe medicine and with extreme minuteness explain first how to take the medicine and then what diet be to be keep to he advise egg raw or hardly cook and seltzer water with warm milk at a certain temperature when the doctor have go away the sick man say something to his brother of which levin could distinguish only the last word " your katya " by the expression with which he gaze at she levin see that he be praise she he call indeed to katya as he call she " I ’m much well already " he say " why with you I should have get well long ago how nice it be " he take her hand and draw it towards his lip but as though afraid she would dislike it he change his mind let it go and only stroke it kitty take his hand in both hers and press it " now turn I over on the left side and go to bed " he say no one could make out what he say but kitty she alone understand she understand because she be all the while mentally keep watch on what he need " on the other side " she say to her husband " he always sleep on that side turn he over it ’ so disagreeable call the servant I ’m not strong enough can you " she say to marya nikolaevna " I ’m afraid not " answer marya nikolaevna terrible as it be to levin to put his arm round that terrible body to take hold of that under the quilt of which he prefer to know nothing under his wife ’s influence he make his resolute face that she know so well and put his arm into the bed take hold of the body but in spite of his own strength he be strike by the strange heaviness of those powerless limb while he be turn he over conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck kitty swiftly and noiselessly turn the pillow beat it up and settle in it the sick man ’s head smooth back his hair which be stick again to his moist brow the sick man keep his brother ’s hand in his own levin feel that he mean to do something with his hand and be pull it somewhere levin yield with a sinking heart yes he draw it to his mouth and kiss it levin shake with sob and unable to articulate a word go out of the room " thou hast hide these thing from the wise and prudent and hast reveal they unto babes " so levin think about his wife as he talk to she that evening levin think of the text not because he consider himself " wise and prudent " he do not so consider himself but he could not help know that he have more intellect than his wife and agafea mihalovna and he could not help know that when he think of death he think with all the force of his intellect he know too that the brain of many great man whose thought he have read have brood over death and yet know not a hundredth part of what his wife and agafea mihalovna know about it different as those two woman be agafea mihalovna and katya as his brother nikolay have call she and as levin particularly like to call she now they be quite alike in this both know without a shade of doubt what sort of thing life be and what be death and though neither of they could have answer and would even not have understand the question that present themselves to levin both have no doubt of the significance of this event and be precisely alike in their way of look at it which they share with million of people the proof that they know for a certainty the nature of death lie in the fact that they know without a second of hesitation how to deal with the die and be not frightened of they levin and other man like he though they could have say a great deal about death obviously do not know this since they be afraid of death and be absolutely at a loss what to do when people be die if levin have be alone now with his brother nikolay he would have look at he with terror and with still great terror wait and would not have know what else to do more than that he do not know what to say how to look how to move to talk of outside thing seem to he shocking impossible to talk of death and depressing subject — also impossible to be silent also impossible " if I look at he he will think I be study he I be afraid if I do not look at he he ’ll think I ’m think of other thing if I walk on tiptoe he will be vex to tread firmly I ’m ashamed " kitty evidently do not think of herself and have no time to think about herself she be think about he because she know something and all go well she tell he about herself even and about her wedding and smile and sympathize with he and pet he and talk of case of recovery and all go well so then she must know the proof that her behavior and agafea mihalovna ’s be not instinctive animal irrational be that apart from the physical treatment the relief of suffering both agafea mihalovna and kitty require for the die man something else more important than the physical treatment and something which have nothing in common with physical condition agafea mihalovna speak of the man just dead have say " well thank god he take the sacrament and receive absolution god grant each one of we such a death " katya in just the same way besides all her care about linen bedsore drink find time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of take the sacrament and receive absolution on get back from the sickroom to their own two room for the night levin sit with hang head not know what to do not to speak of supper of prepare for bed of consider what they be go to do he could not even talk to his wife he be ashamed to kitty on the contrary be more active than usual she be even lively than usual she order supper to be bring herself unpack their thing and herself help to make the bed and do not even forget to sprinkle they with persian powder she show that alertness that swiftness of reflection which come out in man before a battle in conflict in the dangerous and decisive moment of life — those moment when a man show once and for all his value and that all his past have not be waste but have be a preparation for these moment everything go rapidly in her hand and before it be twelve o’clock all their thing be arrange cleanly and tidily in her room in such a way that the hotel room seem like home the bed be make brush comb lookingglasse be put out table napkin be spread levin feel that it be unpardonable to eat to sleep to talk even now and it seem to he that every movement he make be unseemly she arrange the brush but she do it all so that there be nothing shocking in it they could neither of they eat however and for a long while they could not sleep and do not even go to bed " I be very glad I persuade he to receive extreme unction tomorrow " she say sit in her dressing jacket before her fold lookingglass comb her soft fragrant hair with a fine comb " I have never see it but I know mamma have tell I there be prayer say for recovery " " do you suppose he can possibly recover " say levin watch a slender tress at the back of her round little head that be continually hide when she pass the comb through the front " I ask the doctor he say he could not live more than three day but can they be sure I ’m very glad anyway that I persuade he " she say look askance at her husband through her hair " anything be possible " she add with that peculiar rather sly expression that be always in her face when she speak of religion since their conversation about religion when they be engage neither of they have ever start a discussion of the subject but she perform all the ceremony of go to church say her prayer and so on always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so in spite of his assertion to the contrary she be firmly persuade that he be as much a christian as she and indeed a far well one and all that he say about it be simply one of his absurd masculine freak just as he would say about her broderie anglaise that good people patch hole but that she cut they on purpose and so on " yes you see this woman marya nikolaevna do not know how to manage all this " say levin " and   I must own I ’m very very glad you come you be such purity that " he take her hand and do not kiss it to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seem to he improper he merely squeeze it with a penitent air look at her brighten eye " it would have be miserable for you to be alone " she say and lift her hand which hide her cheek flush with pleasure twist her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pin it there " no " she go on " she do not know how luckily I learn a lot at soden " " surely there be not people there so ill " " bad " " what ’ so awful to I be that I can not see he as he be when he be young you would not believe how charming he be as a youth but I do not understand he then " " I can quite quite believe it how I feel that we might have be friend " she say and distressed at what she have say she look round at her husband and tear come into her eye " yes might have be " he say mournfully " he ’ just one of those people of whom they say they ’re not for this world " " but we have many day before we we must go to bed " say kitty glance at her tiny watch the next day the sick man receive the sacrament and extreme unction during the ceremony nikolay levin pray fervently his great eye fasten on the holy image that be set out on a cardtable cover with a colored napkin express such passionate prayer and hope that it be awful to levin to see it levin know that this passionate prayer and hope would only make he feel more bitterly part from the life he so love levin know his brother and the working of his intellect he know that his unbelief come not from life be easy for he without faith but have grow up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomenon crush out the possibility of faith and so he know that his present return be not a legitimate one bring about by way of the same working of his intellect but simply a temporary interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery levin know too that kitty have strengthen his hope by account of the marvelous recovery she have hear of levin know all this and it be agonizingly painful to he to behold the supplicating hopeful eye and the emaciated wrist lift with difficulty make the sign of the cross on the tense brow and the prominent shoulder and hollow gasp chest which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man be pray for during the sacrament levin do what he an unbeliever have do a thousand time he say address god " if thou dost exist make this man to recover " of course this same thing have be repeat many time " and thou wilt save he and I " after extreme unction the sick man become suddenly much well he do not cough once in the course of an hour smile kiss kitty ’s hand thank she with tear and say he be comfortable free from pain and that he feel strong and have an appetite he even raise himself when his soup be bring and ask for a cutlet as well hopelessly ill as he be obvious as it be at the first glance that he could not recover levin and kitty be for that hour both in the same state of excitement happy though fearful of be mistake " be he well " " yes much " " it ’ wonderful " " there ’ nothing wonderful in it " " anyway he ’ well " they say in a whisper smile to one another this selfdeception be not of long duration the sick man fall into a quiet sleep but he be wake up half an hour later by his cough and all at once every hope vanish in those about he and in himself the reality of his suffering crush all hope in levin and kitty and in the sick man himself leave no doubt no memory even of past hope without refer to what he have believe in half an hour before as though ashamed even to recall it he ask for iodine to inhale in a bottle cover with perforated paper levin give he the bottle and the same look of passionate hope with which he have take the sacrament be now fasten on his brother demand from he the confirmation of the doctor ’s word that inhale iodine work wonder " be katya not here " he gasp look round while levin reluctantly assent to the doctor ’s word " no so I can say it it be for her sake I go through that farce she ’ so sweet but you and I can not deceive ourselves this be what I believe in " he say and squeeze the bottle in his bony hand he begin breathe over it at eight o’clock in the evening levin and his wife be drink tea in their room when marya nikolaevna run in to they breathlessly she be pale and her lip be quiver " he be die " she whisper " I ’m afraid will die this minute " both of they run to he he be sit raise up with one elbow on the bed his long back bend and his head hang low " how do you feel " levin ask in a whisper after a silence " I feel I ’m set off " nikolay say with difficulty but with extreme distinctness screw the word out of himself he do not raise his head but simply turn his eye upwards without their reach his brother ’s face " katya go away " he add levin jump up and with a peremptory whisper make she go out " I ’m set off " he say again " why do you think so " say levin so as to say something " because I ’m set off " he repeat as though he have a liking for the phrase " it ’ the end " marya nikolaevna go up to he " you have well lie down you ’d be easy " she say " I shall lie down soon enough " he pronounce slowly " when I ’m dead " he say sarcastically wrathfully " well you can lay I down if you like " levin lay his brother on his back sit down beside he and gaze at his face hold his breath the die man lie with close eye but the muscle twitch from time to time on his forehead as with one think deeply and intensely levin involuntarily think with he of what it be that be happen to he now but in spite of all his mental effort to go along with he he see by the expression of that calm stern face that for the die man all be grow clear and clear that be still as dark as ever for levin " yes yes so " the die man articulate slowly at interval " wait a little " he be silent " right " he pronounce all at once reassuringly as though all be solve for he " o lord " he murmur and sigh deeply marya nikolaevna feel his foot " they ’re get cold " she whisper for a long while a very long while it seem to levin the sick man lie motionless but he be still alive and from time to time he sigh levin by now be exhausted from mental strain he feel that with no mental effort could he understand what it be that be right he could not even think of the problem of death itself but with no will of his own thought keep come to he of what he have to do next close the dead man ’s eye dress he order the coffin and strange to say he feel utterly cold and be not conscious of sorrow nor of loss less still of pity for his brother if he have any feeling for his brother at that moment it be envy for the knowledge the die man have now that he could not have a long time more he sit over he so continually expect the end but the end do not come the door open and kitty appear levin get up to stop she but at the moment he be get up he catch the sound of the die man stir " do not go away " say nikolay and hold out his hand levin give he his and angrily wave to his wife to go away with the die man ’s hand in his hand he sit for half an hour an hour another hour he do not think of death at all now he wonder what kitty be do who live in the next room whether the doctor live in a house of his own he long for food and for sleep he cautiously draw away his hand and feel the foot the foot be cold but the sick man be still breathe levin try again to move away on tiptoe but the sick man stir again and say " do not go " the dawn come the sick man ’s condition be unchanged levin stealthily withdraw his hand and without look at the die man go off to his own room and go to sleep when he wake up instead of news of his brother ’s death which he expect he learn that the sick man have return to his early condition he have begin sit up again cough have begin eat again talk again and again have cease to talk of death again have begin to express hope of his recovery and have become more irritable and more gloomy than ever no one neither his brother nor kitty could soothe he he be angry with everyone and say nasty thing to everyone reproach everyone for his suffering and insist that they should get he a celebrated doctor from moscow to all inquiry make he as to how he feel he make the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness " I ’m suffer horribly intolerably " the sick man be suffer more and more especially from bedsore which it be impossible now to remedy and grow more and more angry with everyone about he blame they for everything and especially for not have bring he a doctor from moscow kitty try in every possible way to relieve he to soothe he but it be all in vain and levin see that she herself be exhaust both physically and morally though she would not admit it the sense of death which have be evoke in all by his take leave of life on the night when he have send for his brother be break up everyone know that he must inevitably die soon that he be half dead already everyone wish for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible and everyone conceal this give he medicine try to find remedy and doctor and deceive he and themselves and each other all this be falsehood disgusting irreverent deceit and owe to the bent of his character and because he love the die man more than anyone else do levin be most painfully conscious of this deceit levin who have long be possess by the idea of reconcile his brother at least in face of death have write to his brother sergey ivanovitch and have receive an answer from he he read this letter to the sick man sergey ivanovitch write that he could not come himself and in touching term he beg his brother ’s forgiveness the sick man say nothing " what be I to write to he " say levin " I hope you be not angry with he " " no not the least " nikolay

mere sight of he by the waiter and the hotelkeeper and all the people stay in the hotel and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and levin and kitty the sick man alone do not express this feeling but on the contrary be furious at their not get he doctor and go on take medicine and talk of life only at rare moment when the opium give he an instant ’s relief from the neverceasing pain he would sometimes half asleep utter what be ever more intense in his heart than in all the other " oh if it be only the end " or " when will it be over " his suffering steadily grow more intense do their work and prepare he for death there be no position in which he be not in pain there be not a minute in which he be unconscious of it not a limb not a part of his body that do not ache and cause he agony even the memory the impression the thought of this body awaken in he now the same aversion as the body itself the sight of other people their remark his own reminiscence everything be for he a source of agony those about he feel this and instinctively do not allow themselves to move freely to talk to express their wish before he all his life be merge in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it there be evidently come over he that revulsion that would make he look upon death as the goal of his desire as happiness hitherto each individual desire arouse by suffering or privation such as hunger fatigue thirst have be satisfy by some bodily function give pleasure but now no physical craving or suffering receive relief and the effort to relieve they only cause fresh suffering and so all desire be merge in one — the desire to be rid of all his suffering and their source the body but he have no word to express this desire of deliverance and so he do not speak of it and from habit ask for the satisfaction of desire which could not now be satisfy " turn I over on the other side " he would say and immediately after he would ask to be turn back again as before " give I some broth take away the broth talk of something why be you silent " and directly they begin to talk he would close his eye and would show weariness indifference and loathing on the tenth day from their arrival at the town kitty be unwell she suffer from headache and sickness and she could not get up all the morning the doctor opine that the indisposition arise from fatigue and excitement and prescribe rest after dinner however kitty get up and go as usual with her work to the sick man he look at she sternly when she come in and smile contemptuously when she say she have be unwell that day

see " say marya nikolaevna though it be say in a whisper the sick man whose hearing levin have notice be very keen must have hear levin say hush to she and look round at the sick man nikolay have hear but these word produce no effect on he his eye have still the same intense reproachful look " why do you think so " levin ask she when she have follow he into the corridor " he have begin pick at himself " say marya nikolaevna " how do you mean " " like this " she say tug at the fold of her woolen skirt levin notice indeed that all that day the patient pull at himself as it be try to snatch something away marya nikolaevna ’s prediction come true towards night the sick man be not able to lift his hand and could only gaze before he with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eye even when his brother or kitty bend over he so that he could see they he look just the same kitty send for the priest to read the prayer for the die while the priest be read it the die man do not show any sign of life his eye be closed levin kitty and marya nikolaevna stand at the bedside the priest have not quite finish read the prayer when the die man stretch sigh and open his eye the priest on finish the prayer put the cross to the cold forehead then slowly return it to the stand and after stand for two minute more in silence he touch the huge bloodless hand that be turn cold " he be go " say the priest and would have move away but suddenly there be a faint stir in the mustache of the dead man that seem glue together and quite distinctly in the hush they hear from the bottom of the chest the sharply define sound " not quite   soon " and a minute later the face brighten a smile come out under the mustache and the woman who have gather round begin carefully lay out the corpse the sight of his brother and the nearness of death revive in levin that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma together with the nearness and inevitability of death that have come upon he that autumn evening when his brother have come to he this feeling be now even strong than before even less than before do he feel capable of apprehend the meaning of death and its inevitability rise up before he more terrible than ever but now thank to his wife ’s presence that feeling do not reduce he to despair in spite of death he feel the need of life and love he feel that love save he from despair and that this love under the menace of despair have become still strong and pure the one mystery of death still unsolved have scarcely pass before his eye when another mystery have arise as insoluble urge he to love and to life the doctor confirm his supposition in regard to kitty her indisposition be a symptom that she be with child from the moment when alexey alexandrovitch understand from his interview with betsy and with stepan arkadyevitch that all that be expect of he be to leave his wife in peace without burden she with his presence and that his wife herself desire this he feel so distraught that he could come to no decision of himself he do not know himself what he want now and put himself in the hand of those who be so pleased to interest themselves in his affair he meet everything with unqualified assent it be only when anna have leave his house and the english governess send to ask he whether she should dine with he or separately that for the first time he clearly comprehend his position and be appal by it most difficult of all in this position be the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with what be now it be not the past when he have live happily with his wife that trouble he the transition from that past to a knowledge of his wife ’s unfaithfulness he have live through miserably already that state be painful but he could understand it if his wife have then on declare to he her unfaithfulness leave he he would have be wound unhappy but he would not have be in the hopeless position — incomprehensible to himself — in which he feel himself now he could not now reconcile his immediate past his tenderness his love for his sick wife and for the other man ’s child with what be now the case that be with the fact that as it be in return for all this he now find himself alone put to shame a laughingstock need by no one and despise by everyone for the first two day after his wife ’s departure alexey alexandrovitch receive applicant for assistance and his chief secretary drive to the committee and go down to dinner in the diningroom as usual without give himself a reason for what he be do he strain every nerve of his being for those two day simply to preserve an appearance of composure and even of indifference answer inquiry about the disposition of anna arkadyevna ’s room and belonging he have exercise immense selfcontrol to appear like a man in whose eye what have occur be not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of event and he attain his aim no one could have detect in he sign of despair but on the second day after her departure when korney give he a bill from a fashionable draper ’s shop which anna have forget to pay and announce that the clerk from the shop be wait alexey alexandrovitch tell he to show the clerk up " excuse I your excellency for venture to trouble you but if you direct we to apply to her excellency would you graciously oblige we with her address " alexey alexandrovitch ponder as it seem to the clerk and all at once turn round he sit down at the table let his head sink into his hand he sit for a long while in that position several time attempt to speak and stop short korney perceive his master ’s emotion ask the clerk to call another time leave alone alexey alexandrovitch recognize that he have not the strength to keep up the line of firmness and composure any long he give order for the carriage that be await he to be take back and for no one to be admit and he do not go down to dinner he feel that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation which he have distinctly see in the face of the clerk and of korney and of everyone without exception whom he have meet during those two day he feel that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of man because that hatred do not come from his be bad in that case he could have try to be well but from his be shamefully and repulsively unhappy he know that for this for the very fact that his heart be tear with grief they would be merciless to he he feel that man would crush he as dog strangle a torn dog yelp with pain he know that his sole means of security against people be to hide his wound from they and instinctively he try to do this for two day but now he feel incapable of keep up the unequal struggle his despair be even intensify by the consciousness that he be utterly alone in his sorrow in all petersburg there be not a human being to whom he could express what he be feel who would feel for he not as a high official not as a member of society but simply as a suffer man indeed he have not such a one in the whole world alexey alexandrovitch grow up an orphan there be two brother they do not remember their father and their mother

declare himself or to leave the town alexey alexandrovitch be not long in hesitation there be at the time as many reason for the step as against it and there be no overbalance consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of abstain when in doubt but anna ’s aunt have through a common acquaintance insinuate that he have already compromise the girl and that he be in honor bind to make she an offer he make the offer and concentrate on his betroth and his wife all the feeling of which he be capable the attachment he feel to anna preclude in his heart every need of intimate relation with other and now among all his acquaintance he have not one friend he have plenty of socalled connection but no friendship alexey alexandrovitch have plenty of people whom he could invite to dinner to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public affair he be concern about whose interest he could reckon upon for anyone he wish to help with whom he could candidly discuss other people ’s business and affair of state but his relation with these people be confine to one clearly define channel and have a certain routine from which it be impossible to depart there be one man a comrade of his at the university with whom he have make friend later and with whom he could have speak of a personal sorrow but this friend have a post in the department of education in a remote part of russia of the people in petersburg the most intimate and most possible be his chief secretary and his doctor mihail vassilievitch sludin the chief secretary be a straightforward intelligent goodhearted and conscientious man and alexey alexandrovitch be aware of his personal goodwill but their five year of official work together seem to have put a barrier between they that cut off warm relation after sign the paper bring he alexey alexandrovitch have sit for a long while in silence glance at mihail vassilievitch and several time he attempt to speak but could not he have already prepare the phrase " you have hear of my trouble " but he end by say as usual " so you ’ll get this ready for I " and with that dismiss he the other person be the doctor who have also a kindly feeling for he but there have long exist a taciturn understanding between they that both be weigh down by work and always in a hurry of his woman friend foremost amongst they countess lidia ivanovna alexey alexandrovitch never think all woman simply as woman be terrible and distasteful to he alexey alexandrovitch have forget the countess lidia ivanovna but she have not forget he at the bitter moment of his lonely despair she come to he and without wait to be announce walk straight into his study she find he as he be sit with his head in both hand " j’ai forcé la consigne " she say walk in with rapid step and

my friendship " she say with a sigh " our support be love that love that he have vouchsafe we his burden be light " she say with the look of ecstasy alexey alexandrovitch know so well " he will be your support and your succor " although there be in these word a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feeling and that new mystical fervor which have lately gain ground in petersburg and which seem to alexey alexandrovitch disproportionate still it be pleasant to he to hear this now " I be weak I be crushed I foresee nothing and now I understand nothing " " dear friend " repeat lidia ivanovna " it ’ not the loss of what I have not now it ’ not that " pursue alexey alexandrovitch " I do not grieve for that but I can not help feel humiliate before other people for the position

heart " say countess lidia ivanovna raise her eye rapturously " and so you can not be ashamed of your act " alexey alexandrovitch knit his brow and crook his hand he crack his finger " one must know

I be almost get up from the dinnertable I could not bear the way my son look at I he do not ask I the meaning of it all but he want to ask and I could not bear the look in his eye he be afraid to look at I but that be not all " alexey alexandrovitch would have refer to the bill that have be bring he but his voice shake and he stop that bill on blue paper for a hat and ribbon he could not recall without a rush of selfpity " I understand dear friend " say lidia ivanovna " I understand it all succor and comfort you will find not in I though I have come only to aid you if I can if I could take from off you all these petty humiliating care   I understand that a woman ’s word a woman ’s superintendence be need you will intrust it to I " silently and gratefully alexey alexandrovitch press her hand " together we will take care of seryozha practical affair be not my strong point but I will set to work I will be your housekeeper do not thank I I do it not from myself " " I can not help thank

thank he and pray to he for succor in he alone we find peace consolation salvation and love " she say and turn her eye heavenwards she begin pray as alexey alexandrovitch gather from her silence alexey alexandrovitch listen to she now and those expression which have seem to he if not distasteful at least exaggerated now seem to he natural and consolatory alexey alexandrovitch have dislike this new enthusiastic fervor he be a believer who be interested in religion primarily in its political aspect and the new doctrine which venture upon several new interpretation just because it pave the way to discussion and analysis be in principle disagreeable to he he have hitherto take up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine and with countess lidia ivanovna who have be carry away by it he have never argue but by silence have assiduously parry her attempt to provoke he into argument now for the first time he hear her word with pleasure and do not inwardly oppose they " I be very very grateful to you both for your deed and for your word " he say when she have finish pray countess lidia ivanovna once more press both her friend ’s hand " now I will enter upon my duty " she say with a smile after a pause as she wipe away the trace of tear " I be go to seryozha only in the last extremity shall I apply to you " and she get up and go out countess lidia ivanovna go into seryozha ’s part of the house and drop tear on the scared child ’s cheek she tell he that his father be a saint and his mother be dead countess lidia ivanovna keep her promise she do actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of alexey alexandrovitch ’s household but she have not overstate the case when say that practical affair be not her strong point all her arrangement have to be modify because they could not be carry out and they be modify by korney alexey alexandrovitch ’s valet who though no one be aware of the fact now manage karenin ’s household and quietly and discreetly report to his master while he be dress all it be necessary for he to know but lidia ivanovna ’s help be none the less real she give alexey alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for he and still more as it be soothe to she to believe in that she almost turn he to christianity — that is from an indifferent and apathetic believer she turn he into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of christian doctrine which have be gain ground of late in petersburg it be easy for alexey alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching alexey alexandrovitch like lidia ivanovna indeed and other who share their view be completely devoid of vividness of imagination that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conception evoke by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other conception and with actual fact he see nothing impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death though exist for unbeliever do not exist for he and that as he be possess of the most perfect faith of the measure of which he be himself the judge therefore there be no sin in his soul and he be experience complete salvation here on earth it be true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith be dimly perceptible to alexey alexandrovitch and he know that when without the slight idea that his forgiveness be the action of a high power he have surrender directly to the feeling of forgiveness he have feel more happiness than now when he be think every instant that christ be in his heart and that in sign official paper he be do his will but for alexey alexandrovitch it be a necessity to think in that way it be such a necessity for he in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint however imaginary from which look down upon you all he could look down on other that he cling as to his one salvation to his delusion of salvation the countess lidia ivanovna have as a very young and sentimental girl be marry to a wealthy man of high rank an extremely goodnatured jovial and extremely dissipated rake two month after marriage her husband abandon she and her impassioned protestation of affection he meet with a sarcasm and even hostility that people know the count ’s good heart and see no defect in the sentimental lidia be at a loss to explain though they be divorce and live apart yet whenever the husband meet the wife he invariably behave to she with the same malignant irony the cause of which be incomprehensible countess lidia ivanovna have long give up be in love with her husband but from that time she have never give up be in love with someone she be in love with several people at once both man and woman she have be in love with almost everyone who have be particularly distinguished in any way she be in love with all the new prince and princess who marry into the imperial family she have be in love with a high dignitary of the church a vicar and a parish priest she have be in love with a journalist three slavophile with komissarov with a minister a doctor an english missionary and karenin all these passion constantly wane or grow more ardent do not prevent she from keep up the most extended and complicated relation with the court and fashionable society but from the time that after karenin ’s trouble she take he under her special protection from the time that she set to work in karenin ’s household look after his welfare she feel that all her other attachment be not the real thing and that she be now genuinely in love and with no one but karenin the feeling she now experience for he seem to she strong than any of her former feeling analyze her feeling and compare it with former passion she distinctly perceive that she would not have be in love with komissarov if he have not save the life of the tsar that she would not have be in love with ristitchkudzhitsky if there have be no slavonic question but that she love karenin for himself for his lofty uncomprehended soul for the sweet — to she — high note of his voice for his drawling intonation his weary eye his character and his soft white hand with their swollen vein she be not simply overjoyed at meet he but she seek in his face sign of the impression she be make on he she try to please he not by her word only but in her whole person for his sake it be that she now lavish more care on her dress than before she catch herself in reverie on what might have be if she have not be marry and he have be free she blush with emotion when he come into the room she could not repress a smile of rapture when he say anything amiable to she for several day now countess lidia ivanovna have be in a state of intense excitement she have learn that anna and vronsky be in petersburg alexey alexandrovitch must be save from see she he must be save even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman be in the same town with he and that he might meet she any minute lidia ivanovna make inquiry through her friend as to what those infamous people as she call anna and vronsky intend do and she endeavor so to guide every movement of her friend during those day that he could not come across they the young adjutant an acquaintance of vronsky through whom she obtain her information and who hope through countess lidia ivanovna to obtain a concession tell she that they have finish their business and be go away next day lidia ivanovna have already begin to calm down when the next morning a note be bring she the handwriting of which she recognize with horror it be the handwriting of anna karenina the envelope be of paper as thick as bark on the oblong yellow paper there be a huge monogram and the letter smell of agreeable scent " who bring it " " a commissionaire from the hotel " it be some time before countess lidia ivanovna could sit down to read the letter her excitement bring on an attack of asthma to which she be subject when she have recover her composure she read the following letter in french " madame la comtesse " the christian feeling with which your heart be fill give I the I feel unpardonable boldness to write to you I be miserable at be separate from my son I entreat permission to see he once before my departure forgive I for recall myself to your memory I apply to you and not to alexey alexandrovitch simply because I do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remember I know your friendship for he I know you will understand I could you send seryozha to I or should I come to the house at some fixed hour or will you let I know when and where I could see he away from home I do not anticipate a refusal know the magnanimity of he with whom it rest you can not conceive the craving I have to see he and so can not conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in I " anna " everything in this letter exasperate countess lidia ivanovna its content and the allusion to magnanimity and especially its free and easy — as she consider — tone " say that there be no answer " say countess lidia ivanovna and immediately open her blottingbook she write to alexey alexandrovitch that she hope to see he at one o’clock at the levee " I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject there we will arrange where to meet well of all at my house where I will order tea as you like it urgent he lay the cross but he give the strength to bear it " she add so as to give he some slight preparation countess lidia ivanovna usually write some two or three letter a day to alexey alexandrovitch she enjoy that form of communication which give opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afford by their personal interview the levee be draw to a close people meet as they be go away and gossip of the late news of the newly bestow honor and the change in the position of the high functionary " if only countess marya borissovna be minister of war and princess vatkovskaya be commanderinchief " say a grayheaded

appointment already you ’re over the ecclesiastical department and your assistant ’s karenin " " goodday prince " say the little old man to a man who come up to he " what be you say of karenin " say the prince " he and putyatov have receive the alexander nevsky " " I think he have it already " " no just look at he " say the little old man point with his embroider hat to karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulder stand in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the imperial council " pleased and happy as a brass farthing " he add stop to shake hand with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportion " no he ’ look old " say the gentleman of the bedchamber " from overwork he ’ always draw up project nowadays he will not let a poor devil go nowadays till he ’ explain it all to he under head " " look old do you say il fait des passions I believe countess lidia ivanovna ’ jealous now of his wife " " oh come now please do not say any harm of countess lidia ivanovna " " why be there any harm in she be in love with karenin " " but be it true madame karenina ’ here " " well not here in the palace but in petersburg I meet she

imperial family to pass thus people talk incessantly of alexey alexandrovitch find fault with he and laugh at he while he block up the way of the member of the imperial council he have capture be explain to he point by point his new financial project never interrupt his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape almost at the same time that his wife leave alexey alexandrovitch there have come to he that bitter moment in the life of an official — the moment when his upward career come to a full stop this full stop have arrive and everyone perceive it but alexey alexandrovitch himself be not yet aware that his career be over whether it be due to his feud with stremov or his misfortune with his wife or simply that alexey alexandrovitch have reach his destine limit it have become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career be at an end he still fill a position of consequence he sit on many commission and committee but he be a man whose day be over and from whom nothing be expect whatever he say whatever he propose be hear as though it be something long familiar and the very thing that be not need but alexey alexandrovitch be not aware of this and on the contrary be cut off from direct participation in governmental activity he see more clearly than ever the error and defect in the action of other and think it his duty to point out mean for their correction shortly after his separation from his wife he begin write his first note on the new judicial procedure the first of the endless series of note he be destine to write in the future alexey alexandrovitch do not merely fail to observe his hopeless position in the official world he be not merely free from anxiety on this head he be positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity " he that be unmarried careth for the thing that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that be married careth for the thing that be of the world how he may please his wife " say the apostle paul and alexey alexandrovitch who be now guide in every action by scripture often recall this text it seem to he that ever since he have be leave without a wife he have in these very project of reform be serve the lord more zealously than before the unmistakable impatience of the member of the council try to get away from he do not trouble alexey alexandrovitch he give up his exposition only when the member of the council seize his chance when one of the imperial family be pass slip away from he leave alone alexey alexandrovitch look down collect his thought then look casually about he and walk towards the door where he hope to meet countess lidia ivanovna " and how strong you all be how sound physically " think alexey alexandrovitch look at the powerfully build gentleman of the bedchamber with his wellcombed perfumed whisker and at the red neck of the prince pinch by his tight uniform he have to pass they on his way " truly be it say that all the world be evil " he think with another sidelong glance at the calf of the gentleman of the bedchamber move forward deliberately alexey alexandrovitch bow with his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who have be talk about he and look towards the door his eye seek countess lidia ivanovna " ah alexey alexandrovitch " say the little old man with a malicious light in his eye at the moment when karenin be on a level with they and be nod with a frigid gesture " I have not congratulate you yet " say the old man point to his newly receive ribbon " thank you " answer alexey alexandrovitch " what an exquisite day today " he add lay emphasis in his peculiar way on the word exquisite that they laugh at he he be well aware but he do not expect anything but hostility from they he be used to that by now catch sight of the yellow shoulder of lidia ivanovna jut out above her corset and her fine pensive eye bid he to she alexey alexandrovitch smile reveal untarnished white tooth and go towards she lidia ivanovna ’s dress have cost she great pain as indeed all her dress have do of late her aim in dress be now quite the reverse of that she have pursue thirty year before then her desire have be to adorn herself with something and the more adorn the well now on the contrary she be perforce deck out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure that her one anxiety be to contrive that the contrast between these adornment and her own exterior should not be too appalling and as far as alexey alexandrovitch be concern she succeed and be in his eye attractive for he she be the one island not only of goodwill to he but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surround he pass through row of ironical eye he be draw as naturally to her loving glance as a plant to the sun " I congratulate you " she say to he her eye on his ribbon suppress a smile of pleasure he shrug his shoulder close his eye as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to he countess lidia ivanovna be very well aware that it be one of his chief source of satisfaction though he never admit it " how be our angel " say countess lidia ivanovna mean seryozha " I can not say I be quite pleased with he " say alexey alexandrovitch raise his eyebrow and open his eye " and sitnikov be not satisfied with he " sitnikov be the tutor to whom seryozha ’s secular education have be intrust " as I have mention to you there ’ a sort of coldness in he towards the most important question which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child " alexey alexandrovitch

on return home from lidia ivanovna ’s could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual pursuit and find that spiritual peace of one save and believe which he have feel of late the thought of his wife who have so greatly sin against he and towards whom he have be so saintly as countess lidia ivanovna have so justly tell he ought not to have trouble he but he be not easy he could not understand the book he be read he could not drive away harassing recollection of his relation with she of the mistake which as it now seem he have make in regard to she the memory of how he have receive her confession of infidelity on their way home from the race especially that he have insist only on the observance of external decorum and have not send a challenge torture he like a remorse he be torture too by the thought of the letter he have write she and most of all his forgiveness which nobody want and his care of the other man ’s child make his heart burn with shame and remorse and just the same feeling of shame and regret he feel now as he review all his past with she recall the awkward word in which after long waver he have make she an offer " but how have I be to blame " he say to himself and this question always excite another question in he — whether they feel differently do their love and marry differently these vronskys and oblonskys   these gentleman of the bedchamber with their fine calf and there pass before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome vigorous selfconfident man who always and everywhere draw his inquisitive attention in spite of himself he try to dispel these thought he try to persuade himself that he be not live for this transient life but for the life of eternity and that there be peace and love in his heart but the fact that he have in this transient trivial life make as it seem to he a few trivial mistake torture he as though the eternal salvation in which he believe have no existence but this temptation do not last long and soon there be reestablish once more in alexey alexandrovitch ’s soul the peace and the elevation by virtue of which he could forget what he do not want to remember " well kapitonitch " say seryozha come back rosy and goodhumored from his walk the day before his birthday and give his overcoat to the tall old hallporter who smile down at the little person from the height of his long figure " well have the bandaged clerk be here today do papa see he " " he see he the minute the chief secretary come out I announce he " say the hallporter with a goodhumored wink " here I ’ll take it off " " seryozha " say the tutor stop in the doorway lead to the inner room " take it off yourself " but seryozha though he hear his tutor ’s feeble voice do not pay attention to it he stand keep hold of the hallporter ’s belt and gaze into his face " well and do papa do what he want for he " the hallporter nod his head affirmatively the clerk with his face tie up who have already be seven time to ask some favor of alexey alexandrovitch interest both seryozha and the hallporter seryozha have come upon he in the hall and have hear he plaintively beg the hallporter to announce he say that he and his child have death stare they in the face since then seryozha have meet he a second time in the hall take great interest in he " well be he very glad " he ask " glad I should think so almost dance as he walk away " " and have anything be leave " ask seryozha after a pause " come sir " say the hallporter then with a shake of his head he whisper " something from the countess " seryozha understand at once that what the hallporter be speak of be a present from countess lidia ivanovna for his birthday " what do you say where " " korney take it to your papa a fine plaything it must be too " " how big like this " " rather small but a fine thing " " a book " " no a thing run along run along vassily lukitch be call you " say the porter hear the tutor ’s step approach and carefully take away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pull off he sign with his head towards the tutor " vassily lukitch in a tiny minute " answer seryozha with that gay and loving smile which always win over the conscientious vassily lukitch seryozha be too happy everything be too delightful for he to be able to help share with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he have hear during his walk in the public garden from lidia ivanovna ’s niece this piece of good news seem to he particularly important from its come at the same time with the gladness of the bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toy have come for he it seem to seryozha that this be a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy " you know papa ’ receive the alexander nevsky today " " to be sure I do people have be already to congratulate he " " and be he glad " " glad at the tsar ’s gracious favor I should think so it ’ a proof he ’ deserve it " say the porter severely and seriously seryozha fall to dream gaze up at the face of the porter which he have thoroughly study in every detail especially the chin that hung down between the gray whisker never see by anyone but seryozha who see he only from below " well and have your daughter be to see you lately " the porter ’s daughter be a ballet dancer " when be she to come on weekday they ’ve their lesson to learn too and you ’ve your lesson sir run along " on come into the room seryozha instead of sit down to his lesson tell his tutor of his supposition that what have be bring he must be a machine " what do you think " he inquire but vassily lukitch be think of nothing but the necessity of learn the grammar lesson for the teacher who be come at two " no do just tell I vassily lukitch " he ask suddenly when he be seat at their work table with the book in his hand " what be great than the alexander nevsky you know papa ’ receive the alexander nevsky " vassily lukitch reply that the vladimir be great than the alexander nevsky " and high still " " well high of all be the andrey pervozvanny " " and high than the andrey " " I do not know " " what you do not know " and seryozha lean on his elbow sink into deep meditation his meditation be of the most complex and diverse character he imagine his father ’s have suddenly be present with both the vladimir and the andrey today and in consequence be much well tempered at his lesson and dream how when he be grow up he would himself receive all the order and what they might invent higher than the andrey directly any high order be invent he would win it they would make a high one still and he would immediately win that too the time pass in such meditation and when the teacher come the lesson about the adverb of place and time and manner of action be not ready and the teacher be not only displeased but hurt this touch seryozha he feel he be not to blame for not have learn the lesson however much he try he be utterly unable to do that as long as the teacher be explain to he he believe he and seem to comprehend but as soon as he be leave alone he be positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word " suddenly " be an adverb of manner of action still he be sorry that he have disappoint the teacher he choose a moment when the teacher be look in silence at the book " mihail ivanitch when be your birthday " he ask all of a sudden " you ’d much well be think about your work birthday be of no importance to a rational being it ’ a day like any other on which one have to do one ’s work " seryozha look intently at the teacher at his scanty beard at his spectacle which have slip down below the ridge on his nose and fall into so deep a reverie that he hear nothing of what the teacher be explain to he he know that the teacher do not think what he say he feel it from the tone in which it be say " but why have you all agree to speak just in the same manner always the dreary and most useless stuff why do he keep I off why do not he love I " he ask himself mournfully and could not think of an answer after the lesson with the grammar teacher come his father ’s lesson while wait for his father seryozha sit at the table play with a penknife and fall to dream among seryozha ’s favorite occupation be search for his mother during his walk he do not believe in death generally and in her death in particular in spite of what lidia ivanovna have tell he and his father have confirm and it be just because of that and after he have be tell she be dead that he have begin look for she when out for a walk every woman of full graceful figure with dark hair be his mother at the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness be stir within he that his breath fail he and tear come into his eye and he be on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to he would lift her veil all her face would be visible she would smile she would hug he he would sniff her fragrance feel the softness of her arm and cry with happiness just as he have one evening lie on her lap while she tickle he and he laugh and bite her white ringcovered finger later when he accidentally learn from his old nurse that his mother be not dead and his father and lidia ivanovna have explain to he that she be dead to he because she be wicked which he could not possibly believe because he love she he go on seek she and expect she in the same way that day in the public garden there have be a lady in a lilac veil whom he have watch with a throb heart believe it to be she as she come towards they along the path the lady have not come up to they but have disappear somewhere that day more intensely than ever seryozha feel a rush of love for she and now wait for his father he forget everything and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife stare straight before he with sparkle eye and dream of she " here be your papa " say vassily lukitch rouse he seryozha jump up and go up to his father and kiss his hand look at he intently try to discover sign of his joy at receive the alexander nevsky " do you have a nice walk " say alexey alexandrovitch sit down in his easy chair pull the volume of the old testament to he and open it although alexey alexandrovitch have more than once tell seryozha that every christian ought to know scripture history thoroughly he often refer to the bible himself during the lesson and seryozha observe this " yes it be very nice indeed papa " say seryozha sit sideways on his chair and rock it which be forbid " I see nadinka " nadinka be a niece of lidia ivanovna ’s who be be bring up in her house " she tell I you ’d be give a new star be you glad papa " " first of all do not rock your chair please " say alexey alexandrovitch " and secondly it ’ not the reward that ’ precious but the work itself and I could have wish you understand that if you now be go to work to study in order to win a reward then the work will seem hard to you but when you work " alexey alexandrovitch as he speak think of how he have be sustain by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning consist of sign one hundred and eighty paper " love your work you will find your reward in it " seryozha ’s eye that have be shine with gaiety and tenderness grow dull and drop before his father ’s gaze this be the same longfamiliar tone his father always take with he and seryozha have learn by now to fall in with it his father always talk to he — so seryozha feel — as though he be address some boy of his own imagination one of those boy that exist in book utterly unlike himself and seryozha always try with his father to act be the storybook boy " you understand that I hope " say his father " yes papa " answer seryozha act the part of the imaginary boy the lesson consist of learn by heart several verse out of the gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the old testament the verse from the gospel seryozha know fairly well but at the moment when he be say they he become so absorbed in watch the sharply protrude bony knobbiness of his father ’s forehead that he lose the thread and he transpose the end of one verse and the beginning of another so it be evident to alexey alexandrovitch that he do not understand what he be say and that irritate he he frown and begin explain what seryozha have hear many time before and never could remember because he understand it too well just as that " suddenly " be an adverb of manner of action seryozha look with scared eye at his father and could think of nothing but whether his father would make he repeat what he have say as he sometimes do and this thought so alarm seryozha that he now understand nothing but his father do not make he repeat it and pass on to the lesson out of the old testament seryozha recount the event themselves well enough but when he have to answer question as to what certain event prefigure he know nothing though he have already be punish over this lesson the passage at which he be utterly unable to say anything and begin fidget and cut the table and swinge his chair be where he have to repeat the patriarch before the flood he do not know one of they except enoch who have be take up alive to heaven last time he have remember their name but now he have forget they utterly chiefly because enoch be the personage he like well in the whole of the old testament and enoch ’s translation to heaven be connect in his mind with a whole long train of thought in which he become absorb now while he gaze with fascinated eye at his father ’s watchchain and a halfunbuttoned button on his waistcoat in death of which they talk to he so often seryozha disbelieve entirely he do not believe that those he love could die above all that he himself would die that be to he something utterly inconceivable and impossible but he have be tell that all man die he have ask people indeed whom he trust and they too have confirm it his old nurse too say the same though reluctantly but enoch have not die and so it follow that everyone do not die " and why can not anyone else so serve god and be take alive to heaven " think seryozha bad people that is those seryozha do not like they might die but the good might all be like enoch " well what be the name of the patriarch " " enoch enos — " " but you have say that already this be bad seryozha very bad if you do not try to learn what be more necessary than anything for a christian " say his father get up " whatever can interest you I be displeased with you and piotr ignatitch " this be the most important of his teacher " be displeased with you I shall have to punish you " his father and his teacher be both displeased with seryozha and he certainly do learn his lesson very badly but still it could not be say he be a stupid boy on the contrary he be far clever than the boy his teacher hold up as example to seryozha in his father ’s opinion he do not want to learn what he be teach in reality he could not learn that he could not because the claim of his own soul be more binding on he than those claim his father and his teacher make upon he those claim be in opposition and he be in direct conflict with his education he be nine year old he be a child but he know his own soul it be precious to he he guard it as the eyelid guard the eye and without the key of love he let no one into his soul his teacher complain that he would not learn while his soul be brim over with thirst for knowledge and he learn from kapitonitch from his nurse from nadinka from vassily lukitch but not from his teacher the spring his father and his teacher reckon upon to turn their millwheel have long dry up at the source but its water do their work in another channel his father punish seryozha by not let he go to see nadinka lidia ivanovna ’s niece but this punishment turn out happily for seryozha vassily lukitch be in a good humor and show he how to make windmill the whole evening pass over this work and in dream how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself — clutch at the sail or tie himself on and whirl round of his mother seryozha do not think all the evening but when he have go to bed he suddenly remember she and pray in his own word that his mother tomorrow for his birthday might leave off hide herself and come to he " vassily lukitch do you know what I pray for tonight extra besides the regular thing " " that you might learn your lesson well " " no " " toy " " no you ’ll never guess a splendid thing but it ’ a secret when it come to pass I ’ll tell you can not you guess " " no I can not guess you tell I " say vassily lukitch with a smile which be rare with he " come lie down I ’m put out the candle " " without the candle I can see well what I see and what I pray for there I be almost tell the secret " say seryozha laugh gaily when the candle be take away seryozha hear and feel his mother she stand over he and with loving eye caress he but then come windmills a knife everything begin to be mix up and he fall asleep on arrive in petersburg vronsky and anna stay at one of the good hotel vronsky apart in a low story anna above with her child its nurse and her maid in a large suite of four room on the day of his arrival vronsky go to his brother ’s there he find his mother who have come from moscow on business his mother and sisterinlaw greet he as usual they ask he about his stay abroad and talk of their common acquaintance but do not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with anna his brother come the next morning to see vronsky and of his own accord ask he about she and alexey vronsky tell he directly that he look upon his connection with madame karenina as marriage that he hope to arrange a divorce and then to marry she and until then he consider she as much a wife as any other wife and he beg he to tell their mother and his wife so " if the world disapprove I do not care " say vronsky " but if my relation want to be on term of relationship with I they will have to be on the same term with my wife " the eld brother who have always a respect for his young brother ’s judgment could not well tell whether he be right or not till the world have decide the question for his part he have nothing against it and with alexey he go up to see anna before his brother as before everyone vronsky address anna with a certain formality treat she as he might a very intimate friend but it be understand that his brother know their real relation and they talk about anna ’s go to vronsky ’s estate in spite of all his social experience vronsky be in consequence of the new position in which he be place labor under a strange misapprehension one would have think he must have understand that society be closed for he and anna but now some vague idea have spring up in his brain that this be only the case in oldfashioned day and that now with the rapidity of modern progress he have unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress the view of society have change and that the question whether they would be receive in society be not a foregone conclusion " of course " he think " she would not be receive at court but intimate friend can and must look at it in the proper light " one may sit for several hour at a stretch with one ’s leg cross in the same position if one know that there ’ nothing to prevent one ’s change one ’s position but if a man know that he must remain sit so with cross leg then cramp come on the leg begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw they this be what vronsky be experience in regard to the world though at the bottom of his heart he know that the world be shut on they he put it to the test whether the world have not change by now and would not receive they but he very quickly perceive that though the world be open for he personally it be closed for anna just as in the game of cat and mouse the hand raise for he be drop to bar the way for anna one of the first lady of petersburg society whom vronsky see be his cousin betsy " at last " she greet he joyfully " and anna how glad I be where be you stop I can fancy after your delightful travel you must find our poor petersburg horrid I can fancy your honeymoon in rome how about the divorce be that all over " vronsky notice that betsy ’s enthusiasm wane when she learn that no divorce have as yet take place " people will throw stone at I I know " she say " but I shall come and see anna yes I shall certainly come you will not be here long I suppose " and she do certainly come to see anna the same day but her tone be not at all the same as in former day she unmistakably pride herself on her courage and wish anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship she only stay ten minute talk of society gossip and on leave she say " you ’ve never tell I when the divorce be to be suppose I ’m ready to fling my cap over the mill other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until you ’re marry and that ’ so simple nowadays ça se fait so you ’re go on friday sorry we shall not see each other again " from betsy ’s tone vronsky might have grasp what he have to expect from the world but he make another effort in his own family his mother he do not reckon upon he know that his mother who have be so enthusiastic over anna at their first acquaintance would have no mercy on she now for have ruin her son ’s career but he have more hope of varya his brother ’s wife he fancy she would not throw stone and would go simply and directly to see anna and would receive she in her own house the day after his arrival vronsky go to she and find she alone express his wish directly " you know alexey " she say after hear he " how fond I be of you and how ready I be to do anything for you but I have not speak because I know I could be of no use to you and to anna arkadyevna " she say articulate the name " anna arkadyevna " with particular care " do not suppose please that I judge she never perhaps in her place I should have do the same I do not and can not enter into that " she say glance timidly at his gloomy face " but one must call thing by their name you want I to go and see she to ask she here and to rehabilitate she in society but do understand that I can not do so I have daughter grow up and I must live in the world for my husband ’s sake well I ’m ready to come and see anna arkadyevna she will understand that I can not ask she here or I should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at thing differently that would offend she I can not raise she " " oh I do not regard she as fall more than hundred of woman you do receive " vronsky interrupt she still more gloomily and he get up in silence understand that his sisterinlaw ’s decision be not to be shake " alexey do not be angry with I please understand that I ’m not to blame " begin varya look at he with a timid smile " I ’m not angry with you " he say still as gloomily " but I ’m sorry in two way I ’m sorry too that this mean break up our friendship — if not break up at least weaken it you will understand that for I too it can not be otherwise " and with that he leave she vronsky know that further effort be useless and that he have to spend these few day in petersburg as though in a strange town avoid every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be expose to the annoyance and humiliation which be so intolerable to he one of the most unpleasant feature of his position in petersburg be that alexey alexandrovitch and his name seem to meet he everywhere he could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turn on alexey alexandrovitch he could not go anywhere without risk of meet he so at least it seem to vronsky just as it seem to a man with a sore finger that he be continually as though on purpose graze his sore finger on everything their stay in petersburg be the more painful to vronsky that he perceive all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand in anna at one time she would seem in love with he and then she would become cold irritable and impenetrable she be worry over something and keep something back from he and do not seem to notice the humiliation which poison his existence and for she with her delicate intuition must have be still more unbearable one of anna ’s object in come back to russia have be to see her son from the day she leave italy the thought of it have never cease to agitate she and as she get near to petersburg the delight and importance of this meeting grow ever great in her imagination she do not even put to herself the question how to arrange it it seem to she natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with he but on her arrival in petersburg she be suddenly make distinctly aware of her present position in society and she grasp the fact that to arrange this meeting be no easy matter she have now be two day in petersburg the thought of her son never leave she for a single instant but she have not yet see he to go straight to the house where she might meet alexey alexandrovitch that she feel she have no right to do she might be refuse admittance and insult to write and so enter into relation with her husband — that it make she miserable to think of do she could only be at peace when she do not think of her husband to get a glimpse of her son out walk find out where and when he go out be not enough for she she have so look forward to this meeting she have so much she must say to he she so long to embrace he to kiss he seryozha ’s old nurse might be a help to she and show she what to do but the nurse be not now live in alexey alexandrovitch ’s house in this uncertainty and in effort to find the nurse two day have slip by hear of the close intimacy between alexey alexandrovitch and countess lidia ivanovna anna decide on the third day to write to she a letter which cost she great pain and in which she intentionally say that permission to see her son must depend on her husband ’s generosity she know that if the letter be show to her husband he would keep up his character of magnanimity and would not refuse her request the commissionaire who take the letter have bring she back the most cruel and unexpected answer that there be no answer she have never feel so humiliated as at the moment when send for the commissionaire she hear from he the exact account of how he have wait and how afterwards he have be tell there be no answer anna feel humiliated insulted but she see that from her point of view countess lidia ivanovna be right her suffering be the more poignant that she have to bear it in solitude she could not and would not share it with vronsky she know that to he although he be the primary cause of her distress the question of she see her son would seem a matter of very little consequence she know that he would never be capable of understand all the depth of her suffering that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate he and she dread that more than anything in the world and so she hide from he everything that relate to her son spend the whole day at home she consider way of see her son and have reach a decision to write to her husband she be just compose this letter when she be hand the letter from lidia ivanovna the countess ’s silence have subdue and depress she but the letter all that she read between the line in it so exasperate she this malice be so revolting beside she passionate legitimate tenderness for her son that she turn against other people and leave off blame herself " this coldness — this pretense of feeling " she say to herself " they must needs insult I and torture the child and I be to submit to it not on any consideration she be bad than I be I do not lie anyway " and she decide on the spot that next day seryozha ’s birthday she would go straight to her husband ’s house bribe or deceive the servant but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they be encompass the unhappy child she go to a toy shop buy toy and think over a plan of action she would go early in the morning at eight o’clock when alexey alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up she would have money in her hand to give the hallporter and the footman so that they should let she in and not raise her veil she would say that she have come from seryozha ’s godfather to congratulate he and that she have be charge to leave the toy at his bedside she have prepare everything but the word she should say to her son often as she have dream of it she could never think of anything the next day at eight o’clock in the morning anna get out of a hire sledge and ring at the front entrance of her former home " run and see what ’ want some lady " say kapitonitch who not yet dress in his overcoat and galosh have peep out of the window and see a lady in a veil stand close up to the door his assistant a lad anna do not know have no soon open the door to she than she come in and pull a threerouble note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand " seryozha — sergey alexeitch " she say and be go on scrutinize the note the porter ’s assistant stop she at the second glass door " whom do you want " he ask she do not hear his word and make no answer notice the embarrassment of the unknown lady kapitonitch go out to she open the second door for she and ask she what she be pleased to want " from prince skorodumov for sergey alexeitch " she say " his honor ’ not up yet " say the porter look at she attentively anna have not anticipate that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she have live for nine year would so greatly affect her memory sweet and painful rise one after another in her heart and for a moment she forget what she be here for " would you kindly wait " say kapitonitch take off her fur cloak as he take off the cloak kapitonitch glance at her face recognize she and make she a low bow in silence " please walk in your excellency " he say to she she try to say something but her voice refuse to utter any sound with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she go with light swift step up the stair bend double and his galosh catch in the step kapitonitch run after she try to overtake she " the tutor ’ there maybe he ’ not dress I ’ll let he know " anna still mount the familiar staircase not understand what the old man be say " this way to the left if you please excuse its not be tidy his honor ’ in the old parlor now " the hallporter say pant " excuse I wait a little your excellency I ’ll just see " he say and overtake she he open the high door and disappear behind it anna stand still wait " he ’ only just awake " say the hallporter come out and at the very instant the porter say this anna catch the sound of a childish yawn from the sound of this yawn alone she know her son and seem to see he live before her eye " let I in go away " she say and

bow his head although she have just say he be well and kind than she in the rapid glance she fling at he take in his whole figure in all its detail feeling of repulsion and hatred for he and jealousy over her son take possession of she with a swift gesture she put down her veil and quicken her pace almost run out of the room she have not time to undo and so carry back with she the parcel of toy she have choose the day before in a toy shop with such love and sorrow as intensely as anna have long to see her son and long as she have be think of it and prepare herself for it she have not in the least expect that see he would affect she so deeply on get back to her lonely room in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she be there " yes it ’ all over and I be again alone " she say to herself and without take off her hat she sit down in a low chair by the hearth fix her eye on a bronze clock stand on a table between the window she try to think the french maid bring from abroad come in to suggest she should dress she gaze at she wonderingly and say " presently " a footman offer she coffee " later on " she say the italian nurse after have take the baby out in her good come in with she and bring she to anna the plump wellfed little baby on see her mother as she always do hold out her fat little hand and with a smile on her toothless mouth begin like a fish with a float bob her finger up and down the starched fold of her embroider skirt make they rustle it be impossible not to smile not to kiss the baby impossible not to hold out a finger for she to clutch crow and prance all over impossible not to offer she a lip which she suck into her little mouth by way of a kiss and all this anna do and take she in her arm and make she dance and kiss her fresh little cheek and bare little elbow but at the sight of this child it be plain than ever to she that the feeling she have for she could not be call love in comparison with what she feel for seryozha everything in this baby be charming but for some reason all this do not go deep to her heart on her first child though the child of an unloved father have be concentrate all the love that have never find satisfaction her baby girl have be bear in the most painful circumstance and have not have a hundredth part of the care and thought which have be concentrate on her first child besides in the little girl everything be still in the future while seryozha be by now almost a personality and a personality dearly love in he there be a conflict of thought and feeling he understand she he love she he judge she she think recall his word and his eye and she be forever — not physically only but spiritually — divided from he and it be impossible to set this right she give the baby back to the nurse let she go and open the locket in which there be seryozha ’s portrait when he be almost of the same age as the girl she get up and take off her hat take up from a little table an album in which there be photograph of her son at different age she want to compare they and begin take they out of the album she take they all out except one the late and good photograph in it he be in a white smock sit astride a chair with frown eye and smile lip it be his well most characteristic expression with her little supple hand her white delicate finger that move with a peculiar intensity today she pull at a corner of the photograph but the photograph have catch somewhere and she could not get it out there be no paperknife on the table and so pull out the photograph that be next to her son ’s it be a photograph of vronsky take at rome in a round hat and with long hair she use it to push out her son ’s photograph " oh here be he " she say glance at the portrait of vronsky and she suddenly recall that he be the cause of her present misery she have not once think of he all the morning but now come all at once upon that manly noble face so familiar and so dear to she she feel a sudden rush of love for he " but where be he how be it he leave I alone in my misery " she think all at once with a feeling of reproach forget she have herself keep from he everything concern her son she send to ask he to come to she immediately with a throb heart she await he rehearse to herself the word in which she would tell he all and the expression of love with which he would console she the messenger return with the answer that he have a visitor with he but that he would come immediately and that he ask whether she would let he bring with he prince yashvin who have just arrive in petersburg " he ’ not come alone and since dinner yesterday he have not see I " she think " he ’ not come so that I could tell he everything but come with yashvin " and all at once a strange idea come to she what if he have cease to love she and go over the event of the last few day it seem to she that she see in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea the fact that he have not dine at home yesterday and the fact that he have insist on their take separate set of room in petersburg and that even now he be not come to she alone as though he be try to avoid meet she face to face " but he ought to tell I so I must know that it be so if I know it then I know what I should do " she say to herself utterly unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she be convince of his not care for she she think he have cease to love she she feel close upon despair and consequently she feel exceptionally alert she ring for her maid and go to her dressingroom as she dress she take more care over her appearance than she have do all those day as though he might if he have grow cold to she fall in love with she again because she have dress and arrange her hair in the way most become to she she hear the bell ring before she be ready when she go into the drawingroom it be not he but yashvin who meet her eye vronsky be look through the photograph of her son which she have forget on the table and he

face " we meet last year at the race give they to I " she say with a rapid movement snatch from vronsky the photograph of her son and glance significantly at he with flash eye " be the race good this year instead of they I see the race in the corso in rome but you do not care for life abroad " she say with a cordial smile " I know you and all your taste though I have see so little of you " " I ’m

with she that she have go out without leave word where she be go that she have not yet come back and that all the morning she have be go about somewhere without a word to he — all this together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she have before yashvin almost snatch her son ’s photograph out of his hand make he serious he decide he absolutely must speak openly with she and he wait for she in her drawingroom but anna do not return alone but bring with she her old unmarried aunt princess oblonskaya this be the lady who have come in the morning and with whom anna have go out shop anna appear not to notice vronsky ’s worried and inquiring expression and begin a lively account of her morning ’s shopping he see that there be something work within she in her flash eye when they rest for a moment on he there be an intense concentration and in her word and movement there be that nervous rapidity and grace which during the early period of their intimacy have so fascinate he but which now so disturb and alarm he the dinner be lay for four all be gather together and about to go into the little diningroom when tushkevitch make his appearance with a message from princess betsy princess betsy beg she to excuse she not have come to say goodbye she have be indisposed but beg anna to come to she between halfpast

idea to I I would go if it be possible to get a box " " I can get one " tushkevitch offer his service " I should be very very grateful to you " say anna " but will not you dine with we " vronsky give a hardly perceptible shrug he be at a complete loss to understand what anna be about what have she bring the old princess oblonskaya home for what have she make tushkevitch stay to dinner for and most amazing of all why be she send he for a box could she possibly think in her position of go to patti ’s benefit where all the circle of her acquaintance would be he look at she with serious eye but she respond with that defiant halfmirthful halfdesperate look the meaning of which he could not comprehend at dinner anna be in aggressively high spirit — she almost flirt both with tushkevitch and with yashvin when they get up from dinner and tushkevitch have go to get a box at the opera yashvin go to smoke and vronsky go down with he to his own room after sit there for some time he run upstairs anna be already dress in a lownecked gown of light silk and velvet that she have have make in paris and with costly white lace on her head frame her face and particularly become show up her dazzling beauty " be you really go to the theater " he say try not to look at she " why do you ask with such alarm " she say wounded again at his not look at she " why should not I go " she appear not to understand the motive of his word " oh of course there ’ no reason whatever " he say frown " that ’ just what I say " she say willfully refuse to see the irony of his tone and quietly turn back her long perfumed glove " anna for god ’s sake what be the matter with you " he say appeal to she exactly as once her husband have do " I do not understand what you be ask " " you know that it ’ out of the question to go " " why so I ’m not go alone princess varvara have go to dress she be go with I " he shrug his shoulder with an air of perplexity and despair " but do you mean to say you do not

and for I there be only one thing that matter whether we love each other other people we need not consider why be we live here apart and not see each other why can not I go I love you and I do not care for anything " she say in russian glance at he with a peculiar gleam in her eye that he could not understand " if you have not change to I why do not you look at I " he look at she he see all the beauty of her face and full dress always so become to she but now her beauty and elegance be just what irritate he " my feeling can not change you know but I beg you I entreat you " he say again in french with a note of tender supplication in his voice but with coldness in his eye she do not hear his word but she see the coldness of his eye and answer with irritation " and I beg you to explain why I should not go " " because it might cause you " he hesitate " I do not understand yashvin n’est pas compromettant and princess varvara be no bad than other oh here she be " vronsky for the first time experience a feeling of anger against anna almost a hatred for she willfully refuse to understand her own position this feeling be aggravate by his be unable to tell she plainly the cause of his anger if he have tell she directly what he be think he would have say " in that dress with a princess only too well known to everyone to show yourself at the theater be equivalent not merely to acknowledge your position as a fallen woman but be fling down a challenge to society that be to say cut yourself off from it forever " he could not say that to she " but how can she fail to see it and what be go on in she " he say to himself he feel at the same time that his respect for she be diminish while his sense of her beauty be intensify he go back scowl to his room and sit down beside yashvin who with his long leg stretch out on a chair be drink brandy and seltzer water he order a glass of the same for himself " you be talk of lankovsky ’s powerful that ’ a fine horse and I would advise you to buy he " say yashvin glance at his comrade ’s gloomy face " his hindquarter be not quite firstrate but the leg and head — one could not wish for anything well " " I think I will take he " answer vronsky their conversation about horse interest he but he do not for an instant forget anna and could not help listen to the sound of step in the corridor and look at the clock on the chimney piece " anna arkadyevna give order to announce that she have go to the theater " yashvin tip another glass of brandy into the bubble water drink it and get up button his coat " well let ’s go " he say faintly smile under his mustache and show by this smile that he know the cause of vronsky ’s gloominess and do not attach any significance to it " I ’m not go " vronsky answer gloomily " well I must I promise to goodbye then if you do come to the stall you can take kruzin ’s stall " add yashvin as he go out " no I ’m busy " " a wife be a care but it ’ bad when she ’ not a wife " think yashvin as he walk out of the hotel vronsky leave alone get up from his chair and begin pace up and down the room " and what ’ today the fourth night yegor and his wife be there and my mother most likely of course all petersburg ’ there now she ’ go in take off her cloak and come into the light tushkevitch yashvin princess varvara " he picture they to himself " what about I either that I ’m frightened or have give up to tushkevitch the right to protect she from every point of view — stupid stupid and why be she put I in such a position " he say with a gesture of despair with that gesture he knock against the table on which there be stand the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy and almost upset it he try to catch it let it slip and angrily kick the table over and ring " if you care to be in my service " he say to the valet who come in " you have well remember your duty this should not be here you ought to have clear away " the valet conscious of his own innocence would have defend himself but glance at his master he see from his face that the only thing to do be to be silent and hurriedly thread his way in and out drop down on the carpet and begin gather up the whole and broken glass and bottle " that ’ not your duty send the waiter to clear away and get my dress coat out " vronsky go into the theater at halfpast eight the performance be in full swing the little old boxkeeper

voice render distinctly a musical phrase the door open to let the boxopener slip through and the phrase draw to the end reach vronsky ’s hearing clearly but the door be close again at once and vronsky do not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment though he know from the thunder of applause that it be over when he enter the hall brilliantly light with chandelier and gas jet

stove look darkly at the raspberry and devoutly hope they would stick and not cook properly the princess conscious that agafea mihalovna ’s wrath must be chiefly direct against she as the person responsible for the raspberry jammaking try to appear to be absorb in other thing and not interested in the jam talk of other matter but cast stealthy glance in the direction of the stove " I always buy my maid ' dress myself of some cheap material " the princess say continue the previous conversation " be not it time to skim it my dear " she add address agafea mihalovna " there ’ not the slight need for you to do it and it ’ hot for you " she say stop kitty " I ’ll do it " say dolly and get up she carefully pass the spoon over the froth sugar and from time to time shake off the cling jam from the spoon by knock it on a plate that be cover with yellowred scum and bloodcolored syrup " how they ’ll enjoy this at teatime " she think of her child remember how she herself as a child have wonder how it be the grownup people do not eat what be good of all — the scum of the jam " stiva say it ’ much well to give money " dolly take up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion what

but how be it you love he anyway before you be allow to speak " kitty feel a peculiar pleasure in be able now to talk to her mother on equal term about those question of such paramount interest in a

remember vronsky eh that ’ true be not it " " yes " kitty answer a pensive smile in her eye " but I really do not know " the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter " what there be in your past that could worry he that vronsky pay you attention — that happen to every girl " " oh yes but we do not mean that " kitty say flush a little " no let I speak " her mother go on " why you yourself would not let I have a talk to vronsky do not you remember " " oh mamma " say kitty with an expression of suffering " there ’ no keep you young people in check nowadays your friendship could not have go beyond what be suitable I should myself have call upon he to explain himself but my darling it ’ not right for you to be agitated please remember that and calm yourself " " I ’m perfectly calm maman " " how happy it be for kitty that anna come then " say dolly " and how unhappy for she it turn out quite the opposite " she say strike by her own idea " then anna be so happy and kitty think herself unhappy now it be just the opposite I often think of she " " a nice person to think about horrid repulsive woman — no heart " say her mother who could not forget that kitty have marry not vronsky but levin " what do you want to talk of it for " kitty say with annoyance " I never think about it and I do not want to think of it and I do not want to think of it " she say catch the sound of her husband ’s wellknown step on the step of the terrace " what ’ that you do not want to think about " inquire levin come onto the terrace but no one answer he and he do not repeat the question " I ’m sorry I ’ve break in on your feminine parliament " he say look round on everyone discontentedly and perceive that they have be talk of something which they would not talk about before he for a second he feel that he be share the feeling of agafea mihalovna vexation at their make jam without water and altogether at the outside shtcherbatsky element he smile however and go up to kitty " well how be you " he ask she look at she with the expression with which everyone look at she now " oh very well " say kitty smile " and how have thing go with you " " the wagon hold three time as much as the old cart do well be we go for the child I ’ve order the horse to be put in " " what you want to take kitty in the wagonette " her mother say reproachfully " yes at a walk pace princess " levin never call the princess " maman " as man often do call their mothersinlaw and the princess dislike his not do so but though he like and respect the princess levin could not call she so without a sense of profane his feeling for his dead mother " come with we maman " say kitty " I do not like to see such imprudence " " well I ’ll walk then I ’m so well " kitty get up and go to her husband and take his hand " you may be well but everything in moderation " say the princess " well agafea mihalovna be the jam do " say levin smile to agafea mihalovna and try to cheer she up " be it all right in the new way " " I suppose it ’ all right for our notion it ’ boil too long " " it ’ll be all the well agafea mihalovna it will not mildew even though our ice have begin to thaw already so that we ’ve no cool cellar to store it " say kitty at once divine her husband ’s motive and address the old housekeeper with the same feeling " but your pickle ’ so good that mamma say she never taste any like it " she add smile and put her kerchief straight agafea mihalovna look angrily at kitty " you need not try to console I mistress I need only to look at you with he and I feel happy " she say and something in the rough familiarity of that with he touch kitty " come along with we to look for mushroom you will show we the good place " agafea mihalovna smile and shake her head as though to say " I should like to be angry with you too but I can not " " do it please by my receipt " say the princess " put some paper over the jam and moisten it with a little rum and without even ice it will never go mildewy " kitty be particularly glad of a chance of be alone with her husband for she have notice the shade of mortification that have pass over his face — always so quick to reflect every feeling — at the moment when he have come onto the terrace and ask what they be talk of and have get no answer when they have set off on foot ahead of the other and have come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road mark with rusty wheel and sprinkle with grain of corn she cling fast to his arm and press it close to she he have quite forget the momentary unpleasant impression and alone with she he feel now that the thought of she approach motherhood be never for a moment absent from his mind a new and delicious bliss quite pure from all alloy of sense in the being near to the woman he love there be no need of speech yet he long to hear the sound of her voice which like her eye have change since she have be with child in her voice as in her eye there be that softness and gravity which be find in people continually concentrate on some cherish pursuit " so you ’re not tired lean more on I " say he " no I ’m so glad of a chance of be alone with you and I must own though I ’m happy with they I do regret our winter evening alone " " that be good but this be even well both be well " he say squeeze her hand " do you know what we be talk about when you come in " " about jam " " oh yes about jam too but afterwards about how man make offer " " ah " say levin listen more to the sound of her voice than to the word she be say and all the while pay attention to the road which pass now through the forest and avoid place where she might make a false step " and about sergey ivanovitch and varenka you ’ve notice I ’m very anxious for it " she go on " what do you think about it " and she peep into his face " I do not know what to think " levin answer smile " sergey seem very strange to I in that way I tell you you know " " yes that he be in love with that girl who die " " that be when I be a child I know about it from hearsay and tradition I remember he then he be wonderfully sweet but I ’ve watch he since with woman he be friendly some of they he like but one feel that to he they ’re simply people not woman " " yes but now with varenka   I fancy there ’ something " " perhaps there be but one have to know he he ’ a peculiar wonderful person he live a spiritual life only he ’ too pure too exalted a nature " " why would this lower he then " " no but he ’ so used to a spiritual life that he can not reconcile himself with actual fact and varenka be after all fact " levin have grow used by now to utter his thought boldly without take the trouble of clothe it in exact language he know that his wife in such moment of love tenderness as now would understand what he mean to say from a hint and she do understand he " yes but there ’ not so much of that actual fact about she as about I I can see that he would never have care for I she be altogether spiritual " " oh no he be so fond of you and I be always so glad when my people like you " " yes he ’ very nice to I but " " it ’ not as it be with poor nikolay   you really care for each other " levin finish " why not speak of he " he add " I sometimes blame myself for not it end in one ’s forget ah how terrible and dear he be yes what be we talk about " levin say after a pause " you think he can not fall in love " say kitty translate into her own language " it ’ not so much that he can not fall in love " levin say smile " but he have not the weakness necessary I ’ve always envy he and even now when I ’m so happy I still envy he " " you envy he for not be able to fall in love " " I envy he for be well than I " say levin " he do not live for himself his whole life be subordinate to his duty and that ’ why he can be calm and contented " " and you " kitty ask with an ironical and loving smile she could never have explain the chain of thought that make she smile but the last link in it be that her husband in exalt his brother and abase himself be not quite sincere kitty know that this insincerity come from his love for his brother from his sense of shame at be too happy and above all from his unflagging craving to be well — she love it in he and so she smile " and you what be you dissatisfied with " she ask with the same smile her disbelief in his selfdissatisfaction delight he and unconsciously he try to draw she into give utterance to the ground of her disbelief " I be happy but dissatisfied with myself " he say " why how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you be happy " " well how shall I say in my heart I really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble — see oh but really you must not skip about like that " he cry break off to scold she for too agile a movement in step over a branch that lie in the path " but when I think about myself and compare myself with other especially with my brother I feel I ’m a poor creature " " but in what way " kitty pursue with the same smile " do not you too work for other what about your cooperative settlement and your work on the estate and your book " " oh but I feel and particularly just now — it ’ your fault " he say press her hand—“that all that do not count I do it in a way halfheartedly if I could care for all that as I care for you instead of that I do it in these day like a task that be set I " " well what would you say about papa " ask kitty " be he a poor creature then as he do nothing for the public good " " he — no but then one must have the simplicity the straightforwardness the goodness of your father and I have not get that I do nothing and I fret about it it ’ all your doing before there be you — and this too " he add with a glance towards her waist that she understood—“i put all my energy into work now I can not and I ’m ashamed I do it just as though it be a task set I I ’m pretend " " well but would you like to change this minute with sergey ivanovitch " say kitty " would you like to do this work for the general good and to love the task set you as he do and nothing else " " of course not " say levin " but I ’m so happy that I do not understand anything so you think he ’ll make she an offer today " he add after a brief silence " I think so and I do not think so only I ’m awfully anxious for it here wait a minute " she stoop down and pick a wild camomile at the edge of the path " come count he do propose he do not " she say give he the flower " he do he do not " say levin tear off the white petal " no no " kitty snatch at his hand stop he she have be watch his finger with interest " you pick off two " " oh but see this little one sha not count to make up " say levin tear off a little halfgrown petal " here ’ the wagonette overtake we " " be not you tired kitty " call the princess " not in the least " " if you be you can get in as the horse be quiet and walk " but it be not worth while to get in they be quite near the place and all walk on together varenka with her white kerchief on her black hair surround by the child gaily and goodhumoredly look after they and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receive a declaration from the man she care for be very attractive sergey ivanovitch walk beside she and never leave off admire she look at she he recall all the delightful thing he have hear from her lip all the good he know about she and become more and more conscious that the feeling he have for she be something special that he have feel long long ago and only once in his early youth the feeling of happiness in be near she continually grow and at last reach such a point that as he put a huge slenderstalked agaric fungus in her basket he look straight into her face and notice the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face he be confuse himself and smile to she in silence a smile that say too much " if so " he say to himself " I ought to think it over and make up my mind and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment " " I ’m go to pick by myself apart from all the rest or else my effort will make no show " he say and he leave the edge of the forest where they be walk on low silky grass between old birch tree stand far apart and go more into the heart of the wood where between the white birch trunk there be gray trunk of aspen and dark bush of hazel walk some forty pace away sergey ivanovitch know he be out of sight stand still behind a bushy spindletree in full flower with its rosy red catkin it be perfectly still all round he only overhead in the birch under which he stand the fly like a swarm of bee buzz unceasingly and from time to time the child ’s voice be float across to he all at once he hear not far from the edge of the wood the sound of varenka ’s contralto voice call grisha and a smile of delight pass over sergey ivanovitch ’s face conscious of this smile he shake his head disapprovingly at his own condition and take out a cigar he begin light it for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree the soft scale of the white bark rub off the phosphorus and the light go out at last one of the match burn and the fragrant cigar smoke hover uncertainly in flat wide coil stretch away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhang branch of a birch tree watch the streak of smoke sergey ivanovitch walk gently on deliberate on his position " why not " he think " if it be only a passing fancy or a passion if it be only this attraction — this mutual attraction I can call it a mutual attraction but if I feel that it be in contradiction with the whole bent of my life — if I feel that in give way to this attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty   but it ’ not so the only thing I can say against it be that when I lose marie I say to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory that ’ the only thing I can say against my feeling that ’ a great thing " sergey ivanovitch say to himself feel at the same time that this consideration have not the slight importance for he personally but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eye of other " but apart from that however much I search I should never find anything to say against my feeling if I be choose by consideration of suitability alone I could not have find anything well " however many woman and girl he think of whom he know he could not think of a girl who unite to such a degree all you all the quality he would wish to see in his wife she have all the charm and freshness of youth but she be not a child and if she love he she love he consciously as a woman ought to love that be one thing another point she be not only far from be worldly but have an unmistakable distaste for worldly society and at the same time she know the world and have all the way of a woman of the good society which be absolutely essential to sergey ivanovitch ’s conception of the woman who be to share his life thirdly she be religious and not like a child unconsciously religious and good as kitty for example be but her life be found on religious principle even in trifling matter sergey ivanovitch find in she all that he want in his wife she be poor and alone in the world so she would not bring with she a mass of relation and their influence into her husband ’s house as he see now in kitty ’s case she would owe everything to her husband which be what he have always desire too for his future family life and this girl who unite all these quality love he he be a modest man but he could not help see it and he love she there be one consideration against it — his age but he come of a longlived family he have not a single gray hair no one would have take he for forty and he remember varenka ’s say that it be only in russia that man of fifty think themselves old and that in france a man of fifty consider himself dans la force de l’âge while a man of forty be un jeune homme but what do the mere reckoning of year matter when he feel as young in heart as he have be twenty year ago be it not youth to feel as he feel now when come from the other side to the edge of the wood he see in the glow light of the slant sunbeam the gracious figure of varenka in her yellow gown with her basket walk lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree and when this impression of the sight of varenka blend so harmoniously with the beauty of the view of the yellow oatfield lie bathe in the slant sunshine and beyond it the distant ancient forest fleck with yellow and melt into the blue of the distance his heart throb joyously a softened feeling come over he he feel that he have make up his mind varenka who have just crouch down to pick a mushroom rose with a supple movement and look round fling away the cigar sergey ivanovitch advance with resolute step towards she " varvara andreevna when I be very young I set before myself the ideal of the woman I love and should be happy to call my wife I have live through a long life and now for the first time I have meet what I seek — in you I love you and offer you my hand " sergey ivanovitch be say this to himself while he be ten pace from varvara kneel down with her hand over the mushroom to guard they from grisha she be call little masha " come here little one there be so many " she be say in her sweet deep voice see sergey ivanovitch approach she do not get up and do not change her position but everything tell he that she feel his presence and be glad of it " well do you find some " she ask from under the white kerchief turn her handsome gently smile face to he " not one " say sergey ivanovitch " do you " she do not answer busy with the child who throng about she " that one too near the twig " she point out to little masha a little fungus split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself varenka get up while masha pick the fungus break it into two white half " this bring back my childhood " she add move apart from the child beside sergey ivanovitch they walk on for some step in silence varenka see that he want to speak she guess of what and feel faint with joy and panic they have walk so far away that no one could hear they now but still he do not begin to speak it would have be well for varenka to be silent after a silence it would have be easy for they to say what they want to say than after talk about mushroom but against her own will as it be accidentally varenka say " so you find nothing in the middle of the wood there be always few though " sergey ivanovitch sigh and make no answer he be annoyed that she have speak about the mushroom he want to bring she back to the first word she have utter about her childhood but after a pause of some length as though against his own will he make an observation in response to her last word " I have hear that the white edible fungus be find principally at the edge of the wood though I can not tell they apart " some minute more pass they move still far away from the child and be quite alone varenka ’s heart throb so that she hear it beat and feel that she be turn red and pale and red again to be the wife of a man like koznishev after her position with madame stahl be to her imagination the height of happiness besides she be almost certain that she be in love with he and this moment it would have to be decide she feel frightened she dread both his speak and his not speak now or never it must be say — that sergey ivanovitch feel too everything in the expression the flushed cheek and the downcast eye of varenka betray a painful suspense sergey ivanovitch see it and feel sorry for she he feel even that to say nothing now would be a slight to she rapidly in his own mind he run over all the argument in support of his decision he even say over to himself the word in which he mean to put his offer but instead of those word some utterly unexpected reflection that occur to he make he ask " what be the difference between the ' birch ' mushroom and the ' white ' mushroom " varenka ’s lip quiver with emotion as she answer " in the top part there be scarcely any difference it ’ in the stalk " and as soon as these word be utter both he and she feel that it be over that what be to have be say would not be say and their emotion which have up to then be continually grow more intense begin to subside " the birch mushroom ’s stalk suggest a dark man ’s chin after two day without shave " say sergey ivanovitch speak quite calmly now " yes that ’ true " answer varenka smile and unconsciously the direction of their walk change they begin to turn towards the child varenka feel both sore and ashamed at the same time she have a sense of relief when he have get home again and go over the whole subject sergey ivanovitch think his previous decision have be a mistaken one he could not be false to the memory of marie " gently child gently " levin shout quite angrily to the child stand before his wife to protect she when the crowd of child fly with shriek of delight to meet they behind the child sergey ivanovitch and varenka walk out of the wood kitty have no need to ask varenka she see from the calm and somewhat crestfallen face of both that her plan have not come off " well " her husband question she as they be go home again " it do not bite " say kitty her smile and manner of speak recall her father a likeness levin often notice with pleasure " how do not bite " " I ’ll show you " she say take her husband ’s hand lift it to her mouth and just faintly brush it with closed lip " like a kiss on a priest ’s hand " " which do not it bite with " he say laugh " both but it should have be like this " " there be some peasant come " " oh they do not see " during the time of the child ’s tea the grownup people sit in the balcony and talk as though nothing have happen though you all especially sergey ivanovitch and varenka be very well aware that there have happen an event which though negative be of very great importance they both have the same feeling rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination which have leave he in the same class or shut he out of the school forever everyone present feel too that something have happen talk eagerly about extraneous subject levin and kitty be particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening and their happiness in their love seem to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have like to feel the same and could not — and they feel a prick of conscience " mark my word alexander will not come " say the old princess that evening they be expect stepan arkadyevitch to come down by train and the old prince have write that possibly he might come too " and I know why " the princess go on " he say that

suddenly there be an unexpected quiver in the princess ’s voice her daughter be silent and look at one another " maman always find something to be miserable about " they say in that glance they do not know that happy as the princess be in her daughter ’s house and useful as she feel herself to be there she have be extremely miserable both on her own account and her husband ’s ever since they have marry their last and favorite daughter and the old home have be leave empty " what be it agafea mihalovna " kitty ask suddenly of agafea mihalovna who be stand with a mysterious air and a face full of

strictly to the book as the teacher have do and that she have well undertake it again herself levin be amazed both at stepan arkadyevitch who by neglect his duty throw upon the mother the supervision of study of which she have no comprehension and at the teacher for teach the child so badly but he promise his sisterinlaw to give the lesson exactly as she wish and he go on teach grisha not in his own way but by the book and so take little interest in it and often forget the hour of the lesson so it have be today " no I ’m go dolly you sit still " he say " we ’ll do it all properly like the

indicate kitty " to stay here that she positively must come to moscow he talk of get a doctor down " " maman he ’ll do everything he have agree to everything " kitty say angry with her mother for appeal to sergey ivanovitch to judge in such a matter in the middle of their conversation they hear the snorting of horse and the sound of wheel on the gravel dolly have not time to get up to go and meet her husband when from the window of the room below where grisha be have his lesson levin leap out and help grisha out after he " it ’ stiva " levin shout from under the balcony " we ’ve finish dolly do not be afraid " he add and start run like a boy to meet the carriage " be ea i d ejus ejus ejus " shout grisha skip along the avenue " and someone else too papa of course " cry levin stop at the entrance of the avenue " kitty do not come down the steep staircase go round " but levin have be mistaken in take the person sit in the carriage for the old prince as he get near to the carriage he see beside stepan arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome stout young man in a scotch cap with long end of ribbon behind this be vassenka veslovsky a distant cousin of the shtcherbatskys a brilliant young gentleman in petersburg and moscow society " a capital fellow and a keen sportsman " as stepan arkadyevitch say introduce he not a whit abashed by the disappointment cause by his have come in place of the old prince veslovsky greet levin gaily claim acquaintance with he in the past and snatch up grisha into the carriage lift he over the pointer that stepan arkadyevitch have bring with he levin do not get into the carriage but walk behind he be rather vexed at the nonarrival of the old prince whom he like more and more the more he see of he and also at the arrival of this vassenka veslovsky a quite uncongenial and superfluous person he seem to he still more uncongenial and superfluous when on approach the step where the whole party child and grownup be gather together in much excitement levin see vassenka veslovsky with a particularly warm and gallant air kiss kitty ’s hand " your wife and I be cousin and very old friend " say vassenka veslovsky once more shake levin ’s hand with great warmth " well be there plenty of bird " stepan arkadyevitch say to levin hardly leave time for everyone to utter their greeting " we ’ve come with the most savage intention

once more kiss her hand hold it in one of his and pat it with the other levin who a minute before have be in the happy frame of mind now look darkly at everyone and everything displease he " who be it he kiss yesterday with those lip " he think look at stepan arkadyevitch ’s tender demonstration to his wife he look at dolly and he do not like she either " she do not believe in his love so what be she so pleased about revolting " think levin he look at the princess who have be so dear to he a minute before and he do not like the manner in which she welcome this vassenka with his ribbon just as though she be in her own house even sergey ivanovitch who have come out too onto the step seem to he unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he meet stepan arkadyevitch though levin know that his brother neither like nor respect oblonsky and varenka even she seem hateful with her air sainte nitouche make the acquaintance of this gentleman while all the while she be think of nothing but get marry and more hateful than anyone be kitty for fall in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regard his visit in the country as though it be a holiday for himself and everyone else and above all unpleasant be that particular smile with which she respond to his smile noisily talk you all go into the house but as soon as they be all seat levin turn and go out kitty see something be wrong with her husband she try to seize a moment to speak to he alone but he make haste to get away from she say he be want at the countinghouse it be long since his own work on the estate have seem to he so important as at that moment " it ’ all holiday for they " he think " but these be no holiday matter they will not wait and there ’ no living without they " levin come back to the house only when they send to summon he to supper on the stair be stand kitty and agafea mihalovna consult about wine for supper " but why be you make all this fuss have what we usually do " " no stiva do not drink   kostya stop what ’ the matter " kitty begin hurry after he but he stride ruthlessly away to the diningroom without wait for she and at once join in the lively general conversation which be be maintain there by vassenka veslovsky and stepan arkadyevitch " well what do you say be we go shooting tomorrow " say stepan arkadyevitch " please do let ’s go " say veslovsky move to another chair where he sit down sideways with one fat leg cross under he " I shall be delighted we will go and have you have any shooting yet this year " say levin to veslovsky look intently at his leg but speak with that forced amiability that kitty know so well in he and that be so out of keeping with he " I can not answer for our finding grouse but there be plenty of snipe only we ought to start early you ’re not tired be not you tired stiva " " I tired I ’ve never be tired yet suppose we stay up all night let ’s go for a walk " " yes really let ’s not go to bed at all capital " veslovsky chime in " oh we all know you can do without sleep and keep other people up too " dolly say to her husband with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always have now with her husband " but to my thinking it ’ time for bed now I ’m go I do not want supper " " no do stay a little dolly " say stepan arkadyevitch go round to her side behind the table where they be have supper " I ’ve so much still to tell you " " nothing really I suppose " " do you know veslovsky have be at anna ’s and he ’ go to they again you know they ’re hardly fifty mile from you and I too must certainly go over there veslovsky come here " vassenka cross over to the lady and sit down beside kitty " ah do tell I please you have stay with she how be she " darya alexandrovna appeal to he levin be leave at the other end of the table and though never pause in his conversation with the princess and varenka he see that there be an eager and mysterious conversation go on between stepan arkadyevitch dolly kitty and veslovsky and that be not all he see on his wife ’s face an expression of real feeling as she gaze with fixed eye on the handsome face of vassenka who be tell they something with great animation " it ’ exceedingly nice at their place " veslovsky be tell they about vronsky and anna " I can not of course take it upon myself to judge but in their house you feel the real feeling of home " " what do they intend do " " I believe they think of go to moscow " " how jolly it would be for we all to go over to they together when be you go there " stepan arkadyevitch ask vassenka " I ’m spend july there " " will you go " stepan arkadyevitch say to his wife " I ’ve be want to a long while I shall certainly go " say dolly " I be sorry for she and I know she she ’ a splendid woman I will go alone when you go back and then I shall be in no one ’s way and it will be well indeed without you " " to be sure " say stepan arkadyevitch " and you kitty " " I why should I go " kitty say flush all over and she glance round at her husband " do you know anna arkadyevna then " veslovsky ask she " she ’ a very fascinating woman " " yes " she answer veslovsky crimson still more she get up and walk across to her husband " are you go shoot then tomorrow " she say his jealousy have in these few moment especially at the flush that have overspread her cheek while she be talk to veslovsky go far indeed now as he hear her word he construe they in his own fashion strange as it be to he afterwards to recall it it seem to he at the moment clear that in ask whether he be go shoot all she care to know be whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka veslovsky with whom as he fancy she be in love " yes I ’m go " he answer she in an unnatural voice disagreeable to himself " no well spend the day here tomorrow or dolly will not see anything of her husband and set off the day after " say kitty the motive of kitty ’s word be interpret by levin thus " do not separate I from he I do not care about your go but do let I enjoy the society of this delightful young man " " oh if you wish we ’ll stay here tomorrow " levin answer with peculiar amiability vassenka meanwhile utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence have occasion get up from the table after kitty and watch she with smile and admiring eye he follow she levin see that look he turn white and for a minute he could hardly breathe " how dare he look at my wife like that " be the feeling that boil within he " tomorrow then do please let we go " say vassenka sit down on a chair and again cross his leg as his habit be levin ’s jealousy go far still already he see himself a deceive husband look upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide they with the convenience and pleasure of life but in spite of that he make polite and hospitable inquiry of vassenka about his shoot his gun and his boot and agree to go shoot next day happily for levin the old princess cut short his agony by get up herself and advise kitty to go to bed but even at this point levin could not escape another agony as he say goodnight to his hostess vassenka would again have kiss her hand but kitty reddening draw back her hand and say with a naïve bluntness for which the old princess scold she afterwards " we do not like that fashion " in levin ’s eye she be to blame for have allow such relation to arise and still more to blame for show so awkwardly that she do not like they " why how can one want to go to bed " say stepan arkadyevitch who after drink several glass of wine at supper be now in his most charming and sentimental humor " look kitty " he say point to the moon which have just rise behind the lime trees—“how exquisite veslovsky this be the time for a serenade you know he have a splendid voice we practice song together along the road he have bring some lovely song with he two new one varvara andreevna and he must sing some duet " when the party have break up stepan arkadyevitch walk a long while about the avenue with veslovsky their voice could be hear singe one of the new song levin hear these voice sit scowl in an easychair in his wife ’s bedroom and maintain an obstinate silence when she ask he what be wrong but when at last with a timid glance she hazard the question " be there perhaps something you dislike about you all burst out and he tell she all he be humiliate himself at what he be say and that exasperate he all the more he stand face she with his eye glitter menacingly under his scowl brow and he squeeze his strong arm across his chest as though he be strain every nerve to hold himself in the expression of his face would have be grim and even cruel if it have not at the same time have a look of suffering which touch she his jaw be twitch and his voice keep break " you must understand that I ’m not jealous that ’ a nasty word I can not be jealous and believe that I can not say what I feel but this be awful I ’m not jealous but I ’m wound humiliated that anybody dare think that anybody dare look at you with eye like that " " eye like what " say kitty try as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade imply in they at the very bottom of her heart she do think there have be something precisely at the moment when he have cross over after she to the other end of the table but she dare not own it even to herself and would have be even more unable to bring herself to say so to he and so increase his suffering " and what can there possibly be attractive about I as I be now " " ah " he cry clutch at his head " you should not say that if you have be attractive then " " oh no kostya oh wait a minute oh do listen " she say look at he with an expression of pained commiseration " why what can you be think about when for I there ’ no one in the world no one no one would you like I never to see anyone " for the first minute she have be offend at his jealousy she be angry that the slight amusement even the most innocent should be forbid she but now she would readily have sacrifice not merely such trifle but everything for his peace of mind to save he from the agony he be suffer " you must understand the horror and comedy of my position " he go on in a desperate whisper " that he ’ in my house that he ’ do nothing improper positively except his free and easy air and the way he sit on his leg he think it ’ the well possible form and so I ’m oblige to be civil to he " " but kostya you ’re exaggerate " say kitty at the bottom of her heart rejoice at the depth of his love for she show now in his jealousy " the most awful part of it all be that you ’re just as you always be and especially now when to I you ’re something sacred and we ’re so happy so particularly happy — and all of a sudden a little wretch he ’ not a little wretch why should I abuse he I have nothing to do with he but why should my and your happiness " " do you know I understand now what it ’ all come from " kitty be begin " well what what " " I see how you look while we be talk at supper " " well well " levin say in dismay she tell he what they have be talk about and as she tell he she be breathless with emotion levin be silent for a space then he scan her pale and distressed face and suddenly he clutch at his head " katya I ’ve be worry you darling forgive I it ’ madness katya I ’m a criminal and how could you be so distressed at such idiocy " " oh I be sorry for you " " for I for I how mad I be but why make you miserable it ’ awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness " " it ’ humiliating too of course " " oh then I ’ll keep he here all the summer and will overwhelm he with civility " say levin kiss her hand " you shall see tomorrow oh yes we be go tomorrow " next day before the lady be up the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party be at the door and laska aware since early morning that they be go shoot after much whining and darting to and fro have sit herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman and disapproving of the delay be excitedly watch the door from which the sportsman still do not come out the first to come out be vassenka veslovsky in new high boot that reach halfway up his thick thigh in a green blouse with a new russian leather cartridgebelt and in his scotch cap with ribbon with a brandnew english gun without a sling laska fly up to he welcome he and jump up ask he in her own way whether the other be come soon but get no answer from he she return to her post of observation and sink into repose again her head on one side and one ear prick up to listen at last the door open with a creak and stepan arkadyevitch ’s spotandtan pointer krak fly out run round and round and turn over in the air stepan arkadyevitch himself follow with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth " good dog good dog krak " he cry encouragingly to the dog who put his paw up on his chest catch at his game bag stepan arkadyevitch be dress in rough legging and spat in torn trouser and a short coat on his head there be a wreck of a hat of indefinite form but his gun of a new patent be a perfect gem and his game bag and cartridge belt though wear be of the very good quality vassenka veslovsky have have no notion before that it be truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatter but to have his shooting outfit of the good quality he see it now as he look at stepan arkadyevitch radiant in his rag graceful wellfed and joyous a typical russian nobleman and he make up his mind that next time he go shoot he would certainly adopt the same getup " well and what about our host " he ask " a young wife " say stepan arkadyevitch smile " yes and such a charming one " " he come down dressed no doubt he ’ run up to she again " stepan arkadyevitch guess right levin have run up again to his wife to ask she once more if she forgive he for his idiocy yesterday and moreover to beg she for christ ’s sake to be more careful the great thing be for she to keep away from the child — they might any minute push against she then he have once more to hear she declare that she be not angry with he for go away for two day and to beg she to be sure to send he a note next morning by a servant on horseback to write he if it be but two word only to let he know that all be well with her kitty be distressed as she always be at parting for a couple of day from her husband but when she see his eager figure look big and strong in his shootingboot and his white blouse and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to she she forget her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure and say goodbye to he cheerfully " pardon gentleman " he say run out onto the step " have you put the lunch in why be the chestnut on the right well it do not matter laska down go and lie down " " put it with the herd of oxen " he say to the herdsman who be wait for he at the step with some question " excuse I here come another villain " levin jump out of the wagonette in which he have already take his seat to meet the carpenter who come towards the step with a rule in his hand " you do not come to the counting house yesterday and now you ’re detain I well what be it " " would your honor let I make another turning it ’ only three step to add and we make it just fit at the same time it will be much more convenient " " you should have listen to I " levin answer with annoyance " I say put the line and then fit in the step now there ’ no set it right do as I tell you and make a new staircase " the point be that in the lodge that be be build the carpenter have spoil the staircase fit it together without calculate the space it be to fill so that the step be all slope when it be put in place now the carpenter want keep the same staircase to add three step " it will be much well " " but where ’ your staircase come out with its three step " " why upon my word sir " the carpenter say with a contemptuous smile " it come out right at the very spot it start so to speak " he say with a persuasive gesture " it come down and come down and come out " " but three step will add to the length too   where be it to come out " " why to be sure it ’ll start from the bottom and go up and go up and come out so " the carpenter say obstinately and convincingly " it ’ll reach the ceiling and the wall " " upon my word why it ’ll go up and up and come out like this " levin take out a ramrod and begin sketch he the staircase in the dust " there do you see " " as your honor like " say the carpenter with a sudden gleam in his eye obviously understand the thing at last " it seem it ’ll be good to make a new one " " well then do it as you ’re tell " levin shout seat himself in the wagonette " down hold the dog philip " levin feel now at leave behind all his family and household care such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he be not disposed to talk besides that he have that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experience as he approach the scene of action if he have anything on his mind at that moment it be only the doubt whether they would start anything in the kolpensky marsh whether laska would show to advantage in comparison with krak and whether he would shoot well that day himself not to disgrace himself before a new spectator — not to be outdo by oblonsky — that too be a thought that cross his brain oblonsky be feel the same and he too be not talkative vassenka veslovsky keep up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter as he listen to he now levin feel ashamed to think how unfair he have be to he the day before vassenka be really a nice fellow simple goodhearted and very goodhumored if levin have meet he before he be marry he would have make friend with he levin rather dislike his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance it be as though he assume a high degree of importance in himself that could not be dispute because he have long nail and a stylish cap and everything else to correspond but this could be forgive for the sake of his good nature and good breeding levin like he for his good education for speak french and english with such an excellent accent and for be a man of his world vassenka be extremely delighted with the left horse a horse of the don steppes he keep praise he enthusiastically " how fine it must be gallop over the steppes on a steppe horse eh be not it " he say he have imagine ride on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic and it turn out nothing of the sort but his simplicity particularly in conjunction with his good look his amiable smile and the grace of his movement be very attractive either because his nature be sympathetic to levin or because levin be try to atone for his sin of the previous evening by see nothing but what be good in he anyway he like his society after they have drive over two mile from home you all at once feel for a cigar and his pocketbook and do not know whether he have lose they or leave they on the table in the pocketbook there be thirtyseven pound and so the matter could not be leave in uncertainty " do you know what levin I ’ll gallop home on that left tracehorse that will be splendid eh " he say prepare to get out " no why should you " answer levin calculate that vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone " I ’ll send the coachman " the coachman ride back on the tracehorse and levin himself drive the remain pair " well now what ’ our plan of campaign tell we all about it " say stepan arkadyevitch " our plan be this now we ’re drive to gvozdyov in gvozdyov there ’ a grouse marsh on this side and beyond gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marsh where there be grouse too it ’ hot now and we ’ll get there — it ’ fifteen mile or so — towards evening and have some evening shooting we ’ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the big moor " " and be there nothing on the way " " yes but we ’ll reserve ourselves besides it ’ hot there be two nice little place but I doubt there be anything to shoot " levin would himself have like to go into these little place but they be near home he could shoot they over any time and they be only little place — there would hardly be room for three to shoot and so with some insincerity he say that he doubt there be anything to shoot when they reach a little marsh levin would have drive by but stepan arkadyevitch with the experienced eye of a sportsman at once detect reed visible from the road " shall not we try that " he say point to the little marsh " levin do please how delightful " vassenka veslovsky begin beg and levin could but consent before they have time to stop the dog have fly one before the other into the marsh " krak laska " the dog come back " there will not be room for three I ’ll stay here " say levin hope they would find nothing but peewit who have be startle by the dog and turn over in their flight be plaintively wail over the marsh " no come along levin let ’s go together " veslovsky call " really there ’ not room laska back laska you will not want another dog will you " levin remain with the wagonette and look enviously at the sportsman they walk right across the marsh except little bird and peewit of which vassenka kill one there be nothing in the marsh " come you see now that it be not that I grudge the marsh " say levin " only it ’ waste time " " oh no it be you all the same do you see we " say vassenka veslovsky clamber awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hand " how splendidly I shoot this bird do not I well shall we soon be get to the real place " the horse start off suddenly levin knock his head against the stock of someone ’s gun and there be the report of a shot the gun do actually go off first but that be how it seem to levin it appear that vassenka veslovsky have pull only one trigger and have leave the other hammer still cock the charge fly into the ground without do harm to anyone stepan arkadyevitch shake his head and laugh reprovingly at veslovsky but levin have not the heart to reprove he in the first place any reproach would have seem to be call forth by the danger he have incur and the bump that have come up on levin ’s forehead and besides veslovsky be at first so naïvely distressed and then laugh so goodhumoredly and infectiously at their general dismay that one could not but laugh with he when they reach the second marsh which be fairly large and would inevitably take some time to shoot over levin try to persuade they to pass it by but veslovsky again overpersuade he again as the marsh be narrow levin like a good host remain with the carriage krak make straight for some clump of sedge vassenka veslovsky be the first to run after the dog before stepan arkadyevitch have time to come up a grouse fly out veslovsky miss it and it fly into an unmown meadow this grouse be leave for veslovsky to follow up krak find it again and point and veslovsky shoot it and go back to the carriage " now you go and I ’ll stay with the horse " he say levin have begin to feel the pang of a sportsman ’s envy he hand the rein to veslovsky and walk into the marsh laska who have be plaintively whine and fret against the injustice of her treatment fly straight ahead to a hopeful place that levin know well and that krak have not yet come upon " why do n’t you stop she " shout stepan arkadyevitch " she will not scare they " answer levin sympathize with his bitch ’s pleasure and hurry after she as she come near and near to the familiar breeding place there be more and more earnestness in laska ’s exploration a little marsh bird do not divert her attention for more than an instant she make one circuit round the clump of reed be begin a second and suddenly quiver with excitement and become motionless " come come stiva " shout levin feel his heart begin to beat more violently and all of a sudden as though some sort of shutter have be draw back from his strain ear all sound confused but loud begin to beat on his hearing lose all sense of distance he hear the step of stepan arkadyevitch mistake they for the tramp of the horse in the distance he hear the brittle sound of the twig on which he have tread take this sound for the flying of a grouse he hear too not far behind he a splashing in the water which he could not explain to himself pick his step he move up to the dog " fetch it " not a grouse but a snipe fly up from beside the dog levin have lift his gun but at the very instant when he be take aim the sound of splashing grow loud come close and be join with the sound of veslovsky ’s voice shout something with strange loudness levin see he have his gun point behind the snipe but still he fire when he have make sure he have miss levin look round and see the horse and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh veslovsky eager to see the shooting have drive into the marsh and get the horse stick in the mud " damn the fellow " levin say to himself as he go back to the carriage that have sink in the mire " what do you drive in for " he say to he dryly and call the coachman he begin pull the horse out levin be vex both at be hinder from shoot and at his horse get stick in the mud and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevitch nor veslovsky help he and the coachman to unharness the horse and get they out since neither of they have the slight notion of harnessing without vouchsafe a syllable in reply to vassenka ’s protestation that it have be quite dry there levin work in silence with the coachman at extricate the horse but then as he get warm at the work and see how assiduously veslovsky be tug at the wagonette by one of the mudguard so that he break it indeed levin blame himself for have under the influence of yesterday ’s feeling be too cold to veslovsky and try to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness when everything have be put right and the carriage have be bring back to the road levin have the lunch serve " bon appétit — bonne conscience ce poulet va tomber jusqu’au fond de mes bottes " vassenka who have recover his spirit quote the french say as he finish his second chicken " well now our trouble be over now everything ’ go to go well only to atone for my sin I ’m bind to sit on the box that ’ so eh no no I ’ll be your automedon you shall see how I ’ll get you along " he answer not let go the rein when levin beg he to let the coachman drive " no I must atone for my sin and I ’m very comfortable on the box " and he drive levin be a little afraid he would exhaust the horse especially the chestnut whom he do not know how to hold in but unconsciously he fall under the influence of his gaiety and listen to the song he sing all the way on the box or the description and representation he give of drive in the english fashion fourinhand and it be in the very good of spirit that after lunch they drive to the gvozdyov marsh vassenka drive the horse so smartly that they reach the marsh too early while it be still hot as they draw near this more important marsh the chief aim of their expedition levin could not help consider how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movement stepan arkadyevitch evidently have the same desire and on his face levin see the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when begin shoot together with a certain goodhumored slyness peculiar to he " how shall we go it ’ a splendid marsh I see and there be hawk " say stepan arkadyevitch point to two great bird hover over the reed " where there be hawk there be sure to be game " " now gentleman " say levin pull up his boot and examine the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression " do you see those reed " he point to an oasis of blackish green in the huge halfmown wet meadow that stretch along the right bank of the river " the marsh begin here straight in front of we do you see — where it be green from here it run to the right where the horse be there be breeding place there and grouse and all round those reed as far as that alder and right up to the mill over there do you see where the pool be that ’ the good place there I once shoot seventeen snipe we ’ll separate with the dog and go in different direction and then meet over there at the mill " " well which shall go to left and which to right " ask stepan arkadyevitch " it ’ wide to the right you two go that way and I ’ll take the left " he say with apparent carelessness " capital we ’ll make the big bag yes come along come along " vassenka exclaim levin could do nothing but agree and they divide as soon as they enter the marsh the two dog begin hunt about together and make towards the green slimecovered pool levin know laska ’s method wary and indefinite he know the place too and expect a whole covey of snipe " veslovsky beside I walk beside I " he say in a faint voice to his companion splash in the water behind he levin could not help feel an interest in the direction his gun be point after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh " oh I will not get in your way do not trouble about I " but levin could not help trouble and recall kitty ’s word at parting " mind you do not shoot one another " the dog come near and near pass each other each pursue its own scent the expectation of snipe be so intense that to levin the squelch sound of his own heel as he draw it up out of the mire seem to be the call of a snipe and he clutch and press the lock of his gun " bang bang " sound almost in his ear vassenka have fire at a flock of duck which be hover over the marsh and fly at that moment towards the sportsman far out of range before levin have time to look round there be the whir of one snipe another a third and some eight more rise one after another stepan arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it be begin its zigzag movement and the snipe fall in a heap into the mud oblonsky aim deliberately at another still fly low in the reed and together with the report of the shot that snipe too fall and it could be see flutter out where the sedge have be cut its unhurt wing show white beneath levin be not so lucky he aim at his first bird too low and miss he aim at it again just as it be rise but at that instant another snipe fly up at his very foot distract he so that he miss again while they be load their gun another snipe rise and veslovsky who have have time to load again send two charge of smallshot into the water stepan arkadyevitch pick up his snipe and with sparkling eye look at levin " well now let we separate " say stepan arkadyevitch and limp on his left foot hold his gun in readiness and whistle to his dog he walk off in one direction levin and veslovsky walk in the other it always happen with levin that when his first shot be a failure he get hot and out of temper and shoot badly the whole day so it be that day the snipe show themselves in number they keep fly up from just under the dog from under the sportsman ’s leg and levin might have retrieve his ill luck but the more he shoot the more he feel disgraced in the eye of veslovsky who keep pop away merrily and indiscriminately kill nothing and not in the slight abash by his ill success levin in feverish haste could not restrain himself get more and more out of temper and end by shoot almost without a hope of hit laska indeed seem to understand this she begin look more languidly and gaze back at the sportsman as it be with perplexity or reproach in her eye shot follow shot in rapid succession the smoke of the powder hang about the sportsman while in the great roomy net of the game bag there be only three light little snipe and of these one have be kill by veslovsky alone and one by both of they together meanwhile from the other side of the marsh come the sound of stepan arkadyevitch ’s shot not frequent but as levin fancy welldirected for almost after each they hear " krak krak apporte " this excite levin still more the snipe be float continually in the air over the reed their whir wing close to the earth and their harsh cry high in the air could be hear on all side the snipe that have rise first and fly up into the air settle again before the sportsman instead of two hawk there be now dozen of they hover with shrill cry over the marsh after walk through the large half of the marsh levin and veslovsky reach the place where the peasant ' mowinggrass be divide into long strip reach to the reed mark off in one place by the trample grass in another by a path mow through it half of these strip have already be mow though there be not so much hope of find bird in the uncut part as the cut part levin have promise stepan arkadyevitch to meet he and so he walk on with his companion through the cut and uncut patch " hi sportsman " shout one of a group of peasant sit on an unharnessed cart " come and have some lunch with we have a drop of wine " levin look round " come along it ’ all right " shout a goodhumoredlooking bearded peasant with a red face show his white tooth in a grin and hold up a greenish bottle that flash in the sunlight " qu’estce qu’ils disent " ask veslovsky " they invite you to have some vodka most likely they ’ve be divide the meadow into lot I should have some " say levin not without some guile hope veslovsky would be tempt by the vodka and would go away to they " why do they offer it " " oh they ’re merrymake really you should join they you would be interested " " allons c’est curieux " " you go you go you ’ll find the way to the mill " cry levin and look round he perceive with satisfaction that veslovsky bend and stumble with weariness hold his gun out at arm ’s length be make his way out of the marsh towards the peasant " you come too " the peasant shout to levin " never fear you taste our cake " levin feel a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread he be exhausted and feel it a great effort to drag his stagger leg out of the mire and for a minute he hesitate but laska be set and you all his weariness vanish and he walk lightly through the swamp towards the dog a snipe fly up at his foot he fire and kill it laska still pointed—“fetch it " another bird fly up close to the dog levin fire but it be an unlucky day for he he miss it and when he go to look for the one he have shoot he could not find that either he wander all about the reed but laska do not believe he have shoot it and when he send she to find it she pretend to hunt for it but do not really and in the absence of vassenka on whom levin throw the blame of his failure thing go no well there be plenty of snipe still but levin make one miss after another the slant ray of the sun be still hot his clothe soak through with perspiration stick to his body his left boot full of water weigh heavily on his leg and squeak at every step the sweat run in drop down his powdergrimed face his mouth be full of the bitter taste his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water his ear be ring with the incessant whir of the snipe he could not touch the stock of his gun it be so hot his heart beat with short rapid throb his hand shake with excitement and his weary leg stumble and stagger over the hillock and in the swamp but still he walk on and still he shoot at last after a disgraceful miss he fling his gun and his hat on the ground " no I must control myself " he say to himself pick up his gun and his hat he call laska and go out of the swamp when he get on to dry ground he sit down pull off his boot and empty it then walk to the marsh drink some stagnanttasting water moisten his burn hot gun and wash his face and hand feel refreshed he go back to the spot where a snipe have settle firmly resolve to keep cool he try to be calm but it be the same again his finger press the cock before he have take a good aim at the bird it get bad and bad he have only five bird in his gamebag when he walk out of the marsh towards the alders where he be to rejoin stepan arkadyevitch before he catch sight of stepan arkadyevitch he see his dog krak dart out from behind the twisted root of an alder black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh and with the air of a conqueror sniff at laska behind krak there come into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of stepan arkadyevitch he come to meet he red and perspire with unbuttoned neckband still limp in the same way " well you have be pop away " he say smile goodhumoredly " how have you get on " query levin but there be no need to ask for he have already see the full game bag " oh pretty fair " he have fourteen bird " a splendid marsh I ’ve no doubt veslovsky get in your way it ’ awkward too shoot with one dog " say stepan arkadyevitch to soften his triumph when levin and stepan arkadyevitch reach the peasant ’s hut where levin always use to stay veslovsky be already there he be sit in the middle of the hut cling with both hand to the bench from which he be be pull by a soldier the brother of the peasant ’s wife who be help he off with his miry boot veslovsky be laugh his infectious goodhumored laugh " I ’ve only just come ils ont été charmants just fancy they give I drink feed I such bread it be exquisite délicieux and the vodka I never taste any well and they would not take a penny for anything and they keep say ' excuse our homely way ' " " what should they take anything for they be entertain you to be sure do you suppose they keep vodka for sale " say the soldier succeed at last in pull the soak boot off the blacken stocking in spite of the dirtiness of the hut which be all muddy by their boot and the filthy dog lick themselves clean and the smell of marsh mud and powder that fill the room and the absence of knife and fork the party drink their tea and eat their supper with a relish only know to sportsman wash and clean they go into a haybarn sweep ready for they where the coachman have be make up bed for the gentleman though it be dusk not one of they want to go to sleep after waver among reminiscence and anecdote of gun of dog and of former shooting party the conversation rest on a topic that interest all of they after vassenka have several time over express his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay this delightful broken cart he suppose it to be break because the shaft have be take out of the good nature of the peasant that have treat he to vodka of the dog who lie at the foot of their respective master oblonsky begin tell they of a delightful shooting party at malthus ’s where he have stay the previous summer malthus be a wellknown capitalist who have make his money by speculation in railway share stepan arkadyevitch describe what grouse moor this malthus have buy in the tver province and how they be preserve and of the carriage and dogcart in which the shooting party have be drive and the luncheon pavilion that have be rig up at the marsh " I do not understand you " say levin sit up in the hay " how be it such people do not disgust you I can understand a lunch with lafitte be all very pleasant but do not you dislike just that very sumptuousness all these people just like our spirit monopolist in old day get their money in a way that gain they the contempt of everyone they do not care for their contempt and then they use their dishonest gain to buy off the contempt they have deserve " " perfectly true " chime in vassenka veslovsky " perfectly oblonsky of course go out of bonhomie but other people say ' well oblonsky stay with they ' " " not a bit of it " levin could hear that oblonsky be smile as he speak " I simply do not consider he more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman they ’ve all make their money alike — by their work and their intelligence " " oh by what work do you call it work to get hold of concession and speculate with they " " of course it ’ work work in this sense that if it be not for he and other like he there would have be no railway " " but that ’ not work like the work of a peasant or a learned profession " " grant but it ’ work in the sense that his activity produce a result — the railway but of course you think the railway useless " " no that ’ another question I be prepared to admit that they ’re useful but all profit that be out of proportion to the labor expend be dishonest " " but who be to define what be proportionate " " make profit by dishonest mean by trickery " say levin conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty " such as banking for instance " he go on " it ’ an evil — the amassing of huge fortune without labor just the same thing as with the spirit monopoly it ’ only the form that ’ change le roi est mort vive le roi no soon be the spirit monopoly abolish than the railway come up and banking company that too be profit without work " " yes that you all be very true and clever lie down krak " stepan arkadyevitch call to his dog who be scratch and turn over all the hay he be obviously convince of the correctness of his position and so talk serenely and without haste " but you have not draw the line between honest and dishonest work that I receive a big salary than my chief clerk though he know more about the work than I do — that ’ dishonest I suppose " " I can not say " " well but I can tell you your receive some five thousand let ’s say for your work on the land while our host the peasant here however hard he work can never get more than fifty rouble be just as dishonest as my earn more than my chief clerk and malthus get more than a stationmaster no quite the contrary I see that society take up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people which be utterly baseless and I fancy there ’ envy at the bottom of it " " no that ’ unfair " say veslovsky " how could envy come in there be something not nice about that sort of business " " you say " levin go on " that it ’ unjust for I to receive five thousand while the peasant have fifty that ’ true it be unfair and I feel it but " " it really be why be it we spend our time ride drinking shoot do nothing while they be forever at work " say vassenka veslovsky obviously for the first time in his life reflect on the question and consequently consider it with perfect sincerity " yes you feel it but you do not give he your property " say stepan arkadyevitch intentionally as it seem provoke levin there have arise of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothersinlaw as though since they have marry sister a kind of rivalry have spring up between they as to which be order his life well and now this hostility show itself in the conversation as it begin to take a personal note " I do not give it away because no one demand that from I and if I want to I could not give it away " answer levin " and have no one to give it to " " give it to this peasant he would not refuse it " " yes but how be I to give it up be I to go to he and make a deed of conveyance " " I do not know but if you be convince that you have no right " " I ’m not at all convinced on the contrary I feel I have no right to give it up that I have duty both to the land and to my family " " no excuse I but if you consider this inequality be unjust why be it you do not act accordingly " " well I do act negatively on that idea so far as not try to increase the difference of position exist between he and I " " no excuse I that ’ a paradox " " yes there ’ something of a sophistry about that " veslovsky agree " ah our host so you ’re not asleep yet " he say to the peasant who come into the barn open the creak door " how be it you ’re not asleep " " no how ’ one to sleep I think our gentleman would be asleep but I hear they chatter I want to get a hook from here she will not bite " he add step cautiously with his bare foot " and where be you go to sleep " " we be go out for the night with the beast " " ah what a night " say veslovsky look out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be see in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open door " but listen there be woman ’s voice singe and on my word not badly too who ’ that singing my friend " " that ’ the maid from hard by here " " let ’s go let ’s have a walk we shall not go to sleep you know oblonsky come along " " if one could only do both lie here and go " answer oblonsky stretch " it ’ capital lie here " " well I shall go by myself " say veslovsky get up eagerly and put on his shoe and stocking " goodbye gentleman if it ’ fun I ’ll fetch you you ’ve treat I to some good sport and I will not forget you " " he really be a capital fellow be not he " say stepan arkadyevitch when veslovsky have go out and the peasant have close the door after he " yes capital " answer levin still think of the subject of their conversation just before it seem to he that he have clearly express his thought and feeling to the good of his capacity and yet both of they straightforward man and not fool have say with one voice that he be comfort himself with sophistry this disconcert he " it ’ just this my dear boy one must do one of two thing either admit that the exist order of society be just and then stick up for one ’s right in it or acknowledge that you be enjoy unjust privilege as I do and then enjoy they and be satisfied " " no if it be unjust you could not enjoy these advantage and be satisfied — at least I could not the great thing for I be to feel that I ’m not to blame " " what do you say why not go after all " say stepan arkadyevitch evidently weary of the strain of thought " we sha not go to sleep you know come let ’s go " levin do not answer what they have say in the conversation that he act justly only in a negative sense absorb his thought " can it be that it ’ only possible to be just negatively " he be ask himself " how strong the smell of the fresh hay be though " say stepan arkadyevitch get up " there ’ not a chance of sleep vassenka have be get up some fun there do you hear the laughing and his voice have not we well go come along " " no I ’m not come " answer levin " surely that ’ not a matter of principle too " say stepan arkadyevitch smile as he feel about in the dark for his cap " it ’ not a matter of principle but why should I go " " but do you know you be prepare trouble for yourself " say stepan arkadyevitch find his cap and get up " how so " " do you suppose I do not see the line you ’ve take up with your wife I hear how it ’ a question of the great consequence whether or not you ’re to be away for a couple of day ' shooting that ’ all very well as an idyllic episode but for your whole life that will not answer a man must be independent he have his masculine interest a man have to be manly " say oblonsky open the door " in what way to go run after servant girl " say levin " why not if it amuse he ça ne tire pas à conséquence it will not do my wife any harm and it ’ll amuse I the great thing be to respect the sanctity of the home there should be nothing in the home but do not tie your own hand " " perhaps so " say levin dryly and he turn on his side " tomorrow early I want to go shoot and I will not wake anyone and shall set off at daybreak " " messieurs venez vite " they hear the voice of veslovsky come back " charmante I ’ve make such a discovery charmante a perfect gretchen and I ’ve already make friend with she really exceedingly pretty " he declare in a tone of approval as though she have be make pretty entirely on his account and he be express his satisfaction with the entertainment that have be provide for he levin pretend to be asleep while oblonsky put on his slipper and light a cigar walk out of the barn and soon their voice be lose for a long while levin could not get to sleep he hear the horse munch hay then he hear the peasant and his eld boy get ready for the night and go off for the night watch with the beast then he hear the soldier arrange his bed on the other side of the barn with his nephew the young son of their peasant host he hear the boy in his shrill little voice tell his uncle what he think about the dog who seem to he huge and terrible creature and ask what the dog be go to hunt next day and the soldier in a husky sleepy voice tell he the sportsman be go in the morning to the marsh and would shoot with their gun and then to check the boy ’s question he say " go to sleep vaska go to sleep or you ’ll catch it " and soon after he begin snore himself and everything be still he could only hear the snort of the horse and the guttural cry of a snipe " be it really only negative " he repeat to himself " well what of it it ’ not my fault " and he begin think about the next day " tomorrow I ’ll go out early and I ’ll make a point of keep cool there be lot of snipe and there be grouse too when I come back there ’ll be the note from kitty yes stiva may be right I ’m not manly with she I ’m tie to her apronstrings well it can not be help negative again " half asleep he hear the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and stepan arkadyevitch for an instant he open his eye the moon be up and in the open doorway brightly light up by the moonlight they be stand talk stepan arkadyevitch be say something of the freshness of one girl compare she to a freshly peel nut and veslovsky with his infectious laugh be repeat some word probably say to he by a peasant " ah you do your good to get round she " levin half asleep say " gentleman tomorrow before daylight " and fall asleep wake up at early dawn levin try to wake his companion vassenka lie on his stomach with one leg in a stocking thrust out be sleep so soundly that he could elicit no response oblonsky half asleep decline to get up so early even laska who be asleep curl up in the hay get up unwillingly and lazily stretch out and straighten her hind leg one after the other get on his boot and stocking take his gun and carefully open the creak door of the barn levin go out into the road the coachman be sleep in their carriage the horse be doze only one be lazily eat oats dip its nose into the manger it be still gray outofdoors " why be you up so early my dear " the old woman their hostess say come out of the hut and address he affectionately as an old friend " go shoot granny do I go this way to the marsh " " straight out at the back by our threshing floor my dear and hemp patch there ’ a little footpath " step carefully with her sunburnt bare foot the old woman conduct levin and move back the fence for he by the threshing floor " straight on and you ’ll come to the marsh our lad drive the cattle there yesterday evening " laska run eagerly forward along the little path levin follow she with a light rapid step continually look at the sky he hope the sun would not be up before he reach the marsh but the sun do not delay the moon which have be bright when he go out by now shine only like a crescent of quicksilver the pink flush of dawn which one could not help see before now have to be seek to be discern at all what be before undefined vague blur in the distant countryside could now be distinctly see they be sheaf of rye the dew not visible till the sun be up wet levin ’s leg and his blouse above his belt in the high grow fragrant hemp patch from which the pollen have already fall out in the transparent stillness of morning the small sound be audible a bee fly by levin ’s ear with the whiz sound of a bullet he look carefully and see a second and a third they be all fly from the beehive behind the hedge and they disappear over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh the path lead straight to the marsh the marsh could be recognize by the mist which rise from it thick in one place and thin in another so that the reed and willow bush sway like island in this mist at the edge of the marsh and the road peasant boy and man who have be herd for the night be lie and in the dawn all be asleep under their coat not far from they be three hobbled horse one of they clank a chain laska walk beside her master press a little forward and look round pass the sleep peasant and reach the first reed levin examine his pistol and let his dog off one of the horse a sleek darkbrown threeyearold see the dog start away switch its tail and snort the other horse too be frightened and splash through the water with their hobbled leg and draw their hoof out of the thick mud with a squelch sound they bound out of the marsh laska stop look ironically at the horse and inquiringly at levin levin pat laska and whistle as a sign that she might begin laska run joyfully and anxiously through the slush that sway under she run into the marsh among the familiar scent of root marsh plant and slime and the extraneous smell of horse dung laska detect at once a smell that pervade the whole marsh the scent of that strongsmelle bird that always excite she more than any other here and there among the moss and marsh plant this scent be very strong but it be impossible to determine in which direction it grow strong or faint to find the direction she have to go far away from the wind not feel the motion of her leg laska bound with a stiff gallop so that at each bind she could stop short to the right away from the wind that blow from the east before sunrise and turn face the wind sniff in the air with dilated nostril she feel at once that not their track only but they themselves be here before she and not one but many laska slacken her speed they be here but where precisely she could not yet determine to find the very spot she begin to make a circle when suddenly her master ’s voice draw she off " laska here " he ask point she to a different direction she stop ask he if she have well not go on do as she have begin but he repeat his command in an angry voice point to a spot cover with water where there could not be anything she obey he pretend she be look so as to please he go round it and go back to her former position and be at once aware of the scent again now when he be not hinder she she know what to do and without look at what be under her foot and to her vexation stumble over a high stump into the water but right herself with her strong supple leg she begin make the circle which be to make all clear to she the scent of they reach she strong and strong and more and more defined and all at once it become perfectly clear to she that one of they be here behind this tuft of reed five pace in front of she she stop and her whole body be still and rigid on her short leg she could see nothing in front of she but by the scent she know it be sit not more than five pace off she stand still feel more and more conscious of it and enjoy it in anticipation her tail be stretch straight and tense and only wag at the extreme end her mouth be slightly open her ear raise one ear have be turn wrong side out as she run up and she breathe heavily but warily and still more warily look round but more with her eye than her head to her master he be come along with the face she know so well though the eye be always terrible to she he stumble over the stump as he come and move as she think extraordinarily slowly she think he come slowly but he be run notice laska ’s special attitude as she crouch on the ground as it be scratch big print with her hind paw and with her mouth slightly open levin know she be point at grouse and with an inward prayer for luck especially with the first bird he run up to she come quite close up to she he could from his height look beyond she and he see with his eye what she be see with her nose in a space between two little thicket at a couple of yard ' distance he could see a grouse turn its head it be listen then lightly preen and fold its wing it disappear round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail " fetch it fetch it " shout levin give laska a shove from behind " but I can not go " think laska " where be I to go from here I feel they but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they be or who they be " but then he shove she with his knee and in an excited whisper say " fetch it laska " " well if that ’ what he wish I ’ll do it but I can not answer for myself now " she think and dart forward as fast as her leg would carry she between the thick bush she scent nothing now she could only see and hear without understand anything ten pace from her former place a grouse rise with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wing and immediately after the shot it splash heavily with its white breast on the wet mire another bird do not linger but rise behind levin without the dog when levin turn towards it it be already some way off but his shot catch it fly twenty pace far the second grouse rise upwards and whirl round like a ball drop heavily on a dry place " come this be go to be some good " think levin pack the warm and fat grouse into his game bag " eh laska will it be good " when levin after load his gun move on the sun have fully rise though unseen behind the stormcloud the moon have lose all of its luster and be like a white cloud in the sky not a single star could be see the sedge silvery with dew before now shine like gold the stagnant pool be all like amber the blue of the grass have change to yellowgreen the marsh bird twitter and swarm about the brook and upon the bush that glitter with dew and cast long shadow a hawk wake up and settle on a haycock turn its head from side to side and look discontentedly at the marsh crow be fly about the field and a barelegged boy be drive the horse to an old man who have get up from under his long coat and be comb his hair the smoke from the gun be white as milk over the green of the grass one of the boy run up to levin " uncle there be duck here yesterday " he shout to he and he walk a little way off behind he and levin be doubly pleased in sight of the boy who express his approval at kill three snipe one after another straight off the sportsman ’s say that if the first beast or the first bird be not miss the day will be lucky turn out correct at ten o’clock levin weary hungry and happy after a tramp of twenty mile return to his night ’s lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck which he tie to his belt as it would not go into the game bag his companion have long be awake and have have time to get hungry and have breakfast " wait a bit wait a bit I know there be nineteen " say levin count a second time over the grouse and snipe that look so much less important now bent and dry and bloodstained with head crooked aside than they do when they be fly the number be verify and stepan arkadyevitch ’s envy please levin he be pleased too on return to find the man send by kitty with a note be already there " I be perfectly well and happy if you be uneasy about I you can feel easy than ever I ’ve a new bodyguard marya vlasyevna”—this be the midwife a new and important personage in levin ’s domestic life " she have come to have a look at I she find I perfectly well and we have keep she till you be back all be happy and well and please do not be in a hurry to come back but if the sport be good stay another day " these two pleasure his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife be so great that two slightly disagreeable incident pass lightly over levin one be that the chestnut trace horse who have be unmistakably overwork on the previous day be off his feed and out of sort the coachman say he be " overdrive yesterday konstantin dmitrievitch yes indeed drive ten mile with no sense " the other unpleasant incident which for the first minute destroy his good humor though later he laugh at it a great deal be to find that of all the provision kitty have provide in such abundance that one would have think there be enough for a week nothing be leave on his way back tired and hungry from shoot levin have so distinct a vision of meatpie that as he approach the hut he seem to smell and taste they as laska have smell the game and he immediately tell philip to give he some it appear that there be no pie leave nor even any chicken " well this fellow ’s appetite " say stepan arkadyevitch laugh and point at vassenka veslovsky " I never suffer from loss of appetite but he ’ really marvelous " " well it can not be help " say levin look gloomily at veslovsky " well philip give I some beef then " " the beef ’ be eat and the bone give to the dog " answer philip levin be so hurt that he say in a tone of vexation " you might have leave I something " and he feel ready to cry " then put away the game " he say in a shaking voice to philip try not to look at vassenka " and cover they with some nettle and you might at least ask for some milk for I " but when he have drink some milk he feel ashamed immediately at have show his annoyance to a stranger and he begin to laugh at his hungry mortification in the evening they go shoot again and veslovsky have several successful shot and in the night they drive home their homeward journey be as lively as their drive out have be veslovsky sing song and relate with enjoyment his adventure with the peasant who have regale he with vodka and say to he " excuse our homely way " and his night ’s adventure with kissinthering and the servantgirl and the peasant who have ask he be he married and on learn that he be not say to he " well mind you do not run after other man ’s wife — you’d well get one of your own " these word have particularly amuse veslovsky " altogether I ’ve enjoy our outing awfully and you levin " " I have very much " levin say quite sincerely it be particularly delightful to he to have get rid of the hostility he have be feel towards vassenka veslovsky at home and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to he next day at ten o’clock levin who have already go his round knock at the room where vassenka have be put for the night " entrez " veslovsky call to he " excuse I I ’ve only just finish my ablution " he say smile stand before he in his underclothe only " do not mind I please " levin sit down in the window " have you sleep well " " like the dead what sort of day be it for shooting " " what will you take tea or coffee " " neither I ’ll wait till lunch I ’m really ashamed I suppose the lady be down a walk now would be capital you show I your horse " after walk about the garden visit the stable and even do some gymnastic exercise together on the parallel bar levin return to the house with his guest and go with he into the drawingroom " we have splendid shooting and so many delightful experience " say veslovsky go up to kitty who be sit at the samovar " what a pity lady be cut off from these delight " " well I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house " levin say to himself again he fancy something in the smile in the allconquering air with which their guest address kitty the princess sit on the other side of the table with marya vlasyevna and stepan arkadyevitch call levin to her side and begin to talk to he about move to moscow for kitty ’s confinement and get ready room for they just as levin have dislike all the trivial preparation for his wedding as derogatory to the grandeur of the event now he feel still more offensive the preparation for the approach birth the date of which they reckon it seem on their finger he try to turn a deaf ear to these discussion of the good pattern of long clothe for the come baby try to turn away and avoid see the mysterious endless strip of knit the triangle of linen and so on to which dolly attach special importance the birth of a son he be certain it would be a son which be promise he but which he still could not believe in — so marvelous it seem — present itself to his mind on one hand as a happiness so immense and therefore so incredible on the other as an event so mysterious that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be and consequent preparation for it as for something ordinary that do happen to people jar on he as confusing and humiliating but the princess do not understand his feeling and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference and so she give he no peace she have commission stepan arkadyevitch to look at a flat and now she call levin up " I know nothing about it princess do as you think fit " he say " you must decide when you will move " " I really do not know I know million of child be bear away from moscow and doctor   why " " but if so " " oh no as kitty wish " " we can not talk to kitty about it do you want I to frighten she why this spring natalia golitzina die from have an ignorant doctor " " I will do just what you say " he say gloomily the princess begin talk to he but he do not hear she though the conversation with the princess have indeed jar upon he he be gloomy not on account of that conversation but from what he see at the samovar " no it ’ impossible " he think glance now and then at vassenka bend over kitty tell she something with his charming smile and at she flushed and disturbed there be something not nice in vassenka ’s attitude in his eye in his smile levin even see something not nice in kitty ’s attitude and look and again the light die away in his eye again as before all of a sudden without the slight transition he feel cast down from a pinnacle of happiness peace and dignity into an abyss of despair rage and humiliation again everything and everyone have become hateful to he " you do just as you think good princess " he say again look round " heavy be the cap of monomach " stepan arkadyevitch say playfully hint evidently not simply at the princess ’s conversation but at the cause of levin ’s agitation which he have notice " how late you be today dolly " everyone get up to greet darya alexandrovna vassenka only rise for an instant and with the lack of courtesy to lady characteristic of the modern young man he scarcely bow and resume his conversation again laugh at something " I ’ve be worried about masha she do not sleep well and be dreadfully tiresome today " say dolly the conversation vassenka have start with kitty be run on the same line as on the previous even discuss anna and whether love be to be put higher than worldly consideration kitty dislike the conversation and she be disturb both by the subject and the tone in which it be conduct and also by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband but she be too simple and innocent to know how to cut short this conversation or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afford she by the young man ’s very obvious admiration she want to stop it but she do not know what to do whatever she do she know would be observe by her husband and the bad interpretation put on it and in fact when she ask dolly what be wrong with masha and vassenka wait till this uninteresting conversation be over begin to gaze indifferently at dolly the question strike levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy " what do you say shall we go and look for mushroom today " say dolly " you all mean please and I shall come too " say kitty and she blush she want from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would come and she do not ask he " where be you go kostya " she ask her husband with a guilty face as he pass by she with a resolute step this guilty air confirm all his suspicion " the mechanician come when I be away I have not see he yet " he say not look at she he go downstairs but before he have time to leave his study he hear his wife ’s familiar footstep run with reckless speed to he " what do you want " he say to she shortly " we be busy " " I beg your pardon " she say to the german mechanician " I want a few word with my husband " the german would have leave the room but levin say to he " do not disturb yourself " " the train be at three " query the german " I must not be late " levin do not answer he but walk out himself with his wife " well what have you to say to I " he say to she in french he do not look she in the face and do not care to see that she in her condition be tremble all over and have a piteous crushed look " I   I want to say that we can not go on like this that this be misery " she say " the servant be here at the sideboard " he say angrily " do not make a scene " " well let ’s go in here " they be stand in the passage kitty would have go into the next room but there the english governess be give tanya a lesson " well come into the garden " in the garden they come upon a peasant weed the path and no long consider that the peasant could see she tearstained and his agitated face that they look like people flee from some disaster they go on with rapid step feel that they must speak out and clear up misunderstanding must be alone together and so get rid of the misery they be both feel " we can not go on like this it ’ misery I be wretched you be wretched what for " she say when they have at last reach a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue " but tell I one thing be there in his tone anything unseemly not nice humiliatingly horrible " he say stand before she again in the same position with his clench fist on his chest as he have stand before she that night " yes " she say in a shake voice " but kostya surely you see I ’m not to blame all the morning I ’ve be try to take a tone   but such people why do he come how happy we be " she say breathless with the sob that shake she although nothing have be pursue they and there be nothing to run away from and they could not possibly have find anything very delightful on that garden seat the gardener see with astonishment that they pass he on their way home with comforted and radiant face after escort his wife upstairs levin go to dolly ’s part of the house darya alexandrovna for her part be in great distress too that day she be walk about the room talk angrily to a little girl who stand in the corner roar " and you shall stand all day in the corner and have your dinner all alone and not see one of your doll and I will not make you a new frock " she say not know how to punish she " oh she be a disgusting child " she turn to levin " where do she get such wicked propensity " " why what have she do " levin say without much interest for he have want to ask she advice and so be annoyed that he have come at an unlucky moment " grisha and she go into the raspberry and there   I can not tell you really what she do it ’ a thousand pity miss elliot ’ not with we this one see to nothing — she ’ a machine figurezvous que la petite " and darya alexandrovna describe masha ’s crime " that prove nothing it ’ not a question of evil propensity at all it ’ simply mischief " levin assure she " but you be upset about something what have you come for " ask dolly " what ’ go on there " and in the tone of her question levin hear that it would be easy for he to say what he have mean to say " I ’ve not be in there I ’ve be alone in the garden with kitty we ’ve have a quarrel for the second time since   stiva come " dolly look at he with her shrewd comprehend eye " come tell I honor bright have there be   not in kitty but in that gentleman ’s behavior a tone which might be unpleasant — not unpleasant but horrible offensive to a husband " " you mean how shall I say stay stay in the corner " she say to masha who detect a faint smile in her mother ’s face have be turn round " the opinion of the world would be that he be behave as young man do behave il fait la cour à une jeune et jolie femme and a husband who ’ a man of the world should only be flatter by it " " yes yes " say levin gloomily " but you notice it " " not only I but stiva notice it just after breakfast he say to I in so many word je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à kitty " " well that ’ all right then now I ’m satisfied I ’ll send he away " say levin " what do you mean be you crazy " dolly cry in horror " nonsense kostya only think " she say laugh " you can go now to fanny " she say to masha " no if you wish it I ’ll speak to stiva he ’ll take he away he can say you ’re expect visitor altogether he do not fit into the house " " no no I ’ll do it myself " " but you ’ll quarrel with he " " not a bit I shall so enjoy it " levin say his eye flash with real enjoyment " come forgive she dolly she will not do it again " he say of the little sinner who have not go to fanny but be stand irresolutely before her mother wait and look up from under her brow to catch her mother ’s eye the mother glance at she the child break into sob hide her face on her mother ’s lap and dolly lay her thin tender hand on her head " and what be there in common between we and he " think levin and he go off to look for veslovsky as he pass through the passage he give order for the carriage to be get ready to drive to the station " the spring be break yesterday " say the footman " well the cover trap then and make haste where ’ the visitor " " the gentleman ’ go to his room " levin come upon veslovsky at the moment when the latter have unpack his thing from his trunk and lay out some new song be put on his gaiter to go out ride whether there be something exceptional in levin ’s face or that vassenka be himself conscious that ce petit brin de cour he be make be out of place in this family but he be somewhat as much as a young man in society can be disconcerted at levin ’s entrance " you ride in gaiter " " yes it ’ much clean " say vassenka put his fat leg on a chair fasten the bottom hook and smile with simplehearted good humor he be undoubtedly a goodnatured fellow and levin feel sorry for he and ashamed of himself as his host when he see the shy look on vassenka ’s face on the table lie a piece of stick which they have break together that morning try their strength levin take the fragment in his hand and begin smash it up break bit off the stick not know how to begin " I want " he pause but suddenly remember kitty and everything that have happen he say look he resolutely in the face " I have order the horse to be putto for you " " how so " vassenka begin in surprise " to drive where " " for you to drive to the station " levin say gloomily " be you go away or have something happen " " it happen that I expect visitor " say levin his strong finger more and more rapidly break off the end of the split stick " and I ’m not expect visitor and nothing have happen but I beg you to go away you can explain my rudeness as you like " vassenka draw himself up " I beg you to explain " he say with dignity understand at last " I can not explain " levin say softly and deliberately try to control the trembling of his jaw " and you ’d well not ask " and as the split end be all break off levin clutch the thick end in his finger break the stick in two and carefully catch the end as it fall probably the sight of those nervous finger of the muscle he have prove that morning at gymnastic of the glittering eye the soft voice and quiver jaw convince vassenka well than any word he bow shrug his shoulder and smile contemptuously " can I not see oblonsky " the shrug and the smile do not irritate levin " what else be there for he to do " he think " I ’ll send he to you at once " " what madness be this " stepan arkadyevitch say when after hear from his friend that he be be turn out of the house he find levin in the garden where he be walk about wait for his guest ’s departure " mais c’est ridicule what fly have sting you mais c’est du dernier ridicule what do you think if a young man " but the place where levin have be sting be evidently still sore for he turn pale again when stepan arkadyevitch would have enlarge on the reason and he himself cut he short " please do not go into it I can not help it I feel ashamed of how I ’m treat you and he but it will not be I imagine a great grief to he to go and his presence be distasteful to I and to my wife " " but it ’ insulting to he et puis c’est ridicule " " and to I it ’ both insulting and distressing and I ’m not at fault in any way and there ’ no need for I to suffer " " well this I do not expect of you on peut être jaloux mais à ce point c’est du dernier ridicule " levin turn quickly and walk away from he into the depth of the avenue and he go on walk up and down alone soon he hear the rumble of the trap and see from behind the tree how vassenka sit in the hay unluckily there be no seat in the trap in his scotch cap be drive along the avenue jolt up and down over the rut " what ’ this " levin think when a footman run out of the house and stop the trap it be the mechanician whom levin have totally forget the mechanician bow low say something to veslovsky then clamber into the trap and they drive off together stepan arkadyevitch and the princess be much upset by levin ’s action and he himself feel not only in the high degree ridicule but also utterly guilty and disgraced but remember what suffering he and his wife have be through when he ask himself how he should act another time he answer that he should do just the same again in spite of all this towards the end of that day everyone except the princess who could not pardon levin ’s action become extraordinarily lively and goodhumored like child after a punishment or grownup people after a dreary ceremonious reception so that by the evening vassenka ’s dismissal be speak of in the absence of the princess as though it be some remote event and dolly who have inherit her father ’s gift of humorous storytelling make varenka helpless with laughter as she relate for the third and fourth time always with fresh humorous addition how she have only just put on her new shoe for the benefit of the visitor and on go into the drawingroom hear suddenly the rumble of the trap and who should be in the trap but vassenka himself with his scotch cap and his song and his gaiter and all sit in the hay " if only you ’d order out the carriage but no and then I hear ' stop ' oh I think they ’ve relent I look out and behold a fat german be sit down by he and drive away and my new shoe all for nothing " darya alexandrovna carry out her intention and go to see anna she be sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything levin dislike she quite understand how right the levins be in not wish to have anything to do with vronsky but she feel she must go and see anna and show she that her feeling could not be change in spite of the change in her position that she might be independent of the levins in this expedition darya alexandrovna send to the village to hire horse for the drive but levin learn of it go to she to protest " what make you suppose that I dislike your go but even if I do dislike it I should still more dislike your not take my horse " he say " you never tell I that you be go for certain hire horse in the village be disagreeable to I and what ’ of more importance they ’ll undertake the job and never get you there I have horse and if you do not want to wound I you ’ll take mine " darya alexandrovna have to consent and on the day fix levin have ready for his sisterinlaw a set of four horse and relay get they together from the farm and saddlehorse — not at all a smartlooking set but capable of take darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day at that moment when horse be want for the princess who be go and for the midwife it be a difficult matter for levin to make up the number but the duty of hospitality would not let he allow darya alexandrovna to hire horse when stay in his house moreover he be well aware that the twenty rouble that would be ask for the journey be a serious matter for her darya alexandrovna ’s pecuniary affair which be in a very unsatisfactory state be take to heart by the levins as if they be their own darya alexandrovna by levin ’s advice start before daybreak the road be good the carriage comfortable the horse trot along merrily and on the box besides the coachman sit the countinghouse clerk whom levin be send instead of a groom for great security darya alexandrovna doze and wake up only on reach the inn where the horse be to be change after drink tea at the same welltodo peasant ’s with whom levin have stay on the way to sviazhsky ’s and chat with the woman about their child and with the old man about count vronsky whom the latter praise very highly darya alexandrovna at ten o’clock go on again at home look after her child she have no time to think so now after this journey of four hour all the thought she have suppress before rush swarm into her brain and she think over all her life as she never have before and from the most different point of view her thought seem strange even to herself at first she think about the child about whom she be uneasy although the princess and kitty she reckon more upon she have promise to look after they " if only masha do not begin her naughty trick if grisha be not kick by a horse and lily ’s stomach be not upset again " she think but these question of the present be succeed by question of the immediate future she begin think how she have to get a new flat in moscow for the come winter to renew the drawingroom furniture and to make her eld girl a cloak then question of the more remote future occur to she how she be to place her child in the world " the girl be all right " she think " but the boy " " it ’ very well that I ’m teach grisha but of course that ’ only because I be free myself now I ’m not with child stiva of course there ’ no count on and with the help of goodnatured friend I can bring they up but if there ’ another baby come " and the thought strike she how untruly it be say that the curse lay on woman be that in sorrow she should bring forth child " the birth itself that ’ nothing but the month of carry the child — that ’ what ’ so intolerable " she think picture to herself her last pregnancy and the death of the last baby and she recall the conversation she have just have with the young woman at the inn on be ask whether she have any child the handsome young woman have answer cheerfully " I have a girl baby but god set I free I bury she last lent " " well do you grieve very much for she " ask darya alexandrovna " why grieve the old man have grandchild enough as it be it be only a trouble no working nor nothing only a tie " this answer have strike darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the goodnatured and pleasing face of the young woman but now she could not help recall these word in those cynical word there be indeed a grain of truth " yes altogether " think darya alexandrovna look back over her whole existence during those fifteen year of her married life " pregnancy sickness mental incapacity indifference to everything and most of all — hideousness kitty young and pretty as she be even kitty have lose her look and I when I ’m with child become hideous I know it the birth the agony the hideous agony that last moment   then the nursing the sleepless night the fearful pain " darya alexandrovna shudder at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breast which she have suffer with almost every child " then the child ’s illness that everlasting apprehension then bring they up evil propensity " she think of little masha ’s crime among the raspberry " education latin — it ’ all so incomprehensible and difficult and on the top of it all the death of these child " and there rise again before her imagination the cruel memory that always tear her mother ’s heart of the death of her last little baby who have die of croup his funeral the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin and her own tear heart and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its project temple and the open wondering little mouth see in the coffin at the moment when it be be cover with the little pink lid with a cross braid on it " and all this what ’ it for what be to come of it all that I ’m waste my life never have a moment ’s peace either with child or nurse a child forever irritable peevish wretched myself and worry other repulsive to my husband while the child be grow up unhappy badly educated and penniless even now if it be not for spend the summer at the levins ' I do not know how we should be manage to live of course kostya and kitty have so much tact that we do not feel it but it can not go on they ’ll have child they will not be able to keep we it ’ a drag on they as it be how be papa who have hardly anything leave for himself to help we so that I can not even bring the child up by myself and may find it hard with the help of other people at the cost of humiliation why even if we suppose the great good luck that the child do not die and I bring they up somehow at the very good they ’ll simply be decent people that ’ all I can hope for and to gain simply that — what agony what toil one ’s whole life ruin " again she recall what the young peasant woman have say and again she be revolt at the thought but she could not help admit that there be a grain of brutal truth in the word " be it far now mihail " darya alexandrovna ask the countinghouse clerk to turn her mind from thought that be frighten she " from this village they say it ’ five mile " the carriage drive along the village street and onto a bridge on the bridge be a crowd of peasant woman with coil of tie for the sheaf on their shoulder gaily and noisily chatter they stand still on the bridge stare inquisitively at the carriage all the face turn to darya alexandrovna look to she healthy and happy make she envious of their enjoyment of life " they ’re all live they ’re all enjoy life " darya alexandrovna still muse when she have pass the peasant woman and be drive uphill again at a trot seat comfortably on the soft spring of the old carriage " while I let out as it be from prison from the world of worry that fret I to death be only look about I now for an instant you all live those peasant woman and my sister natalia and varenka and anna whom I be go to see — all but not I " and they attack anna what for be I any well I have anyway a husband I love — not as I should like to love he still I do love he while anna never love hers how be she to blame she want to live god have put that in our heart very likely I should have do the same even to this day I do not feel sure I do right in listen to she at that terrible time when she come to I in moscow I ought then to have cast off my husband and have begin my life fresh I might have love and have be love in reality and be it any well as it be I do not respect he he ’ necessary to I " she think about her husband " and I put up with he be that any well at that time I could still have be admire I have beauty leave I still " darya alexandrovna pursue her thought and she would have like to look at herself in the lookingglass she have a travel lookingglass in her handbag and she want to take it out but look at the back of the coachman and the sway countinghouse clerk she feel that she would be ashamed if either of they be to look round and she do not take out the glass but without look in the glass she think that even now it be not too late and she think of sergey ivanovitch who be always particularly attentive to she of stiva ’s goodhearted friend turovtsin who have help she nurse her child through the scarlatina and be in love with she and there be someone else a quite young man who — her husband have tell she it as a joke — think she more beautiful than either of her sister and the most passionate and impossible romance rise before darya alexandrovna ’s imagination " anna do quite right and certainly I shall never reproach she for it she be happy she make another person happy and she ’ not break down as I be but most likely just as she always be bright clever open to every impression " think darya alexandrovna — and a sly smile curve her lip for as she ponder on anna ’s love affair darya alexandrovna construct on parallel line an almost identical love affair for herself with an imaginary composite figure the ideal man who be in love with she she like anna confess the whole affair to her husband and the amazement and perplexity of stepan arkadyevitch at this avowal make she smile in such daydream she reach the turning of the highroad that lead to vozdvizhenskoe the coachman pull up his four horse and look round to the right to a field of rye where some peasant be sit on a cart the countinghouse clerk be just go to jump down but on second thought he shout peremptorily to the peasant instead and beckon to they to come up the wind that seem to blow as they drive drop when the carriage stand still gadfly settle on the steam horse that angrily shake they off the metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe that come to they from the cart cease one of the peasant get up and come towards the carriage " well you be slow " the countinghouse clerk shout angrily to the peasant who be step slowly with his bare foot over the rut of the rough dry road " come along do " a curlyheaded old man with a bit of bast tie round his hair and his bend back dark with perspiration come towards the carriage quicken his step and take hold of the mudguard with his sunburnt hand " vozdvizhenskoe the manor house the count ’s " he repeat " go on to the end of this track then turn to the left straight along the avenue and you ’ll come right upon it but whom do you want the count himself " " well be they at home my good man " darya alexandrovna say vaguely not know how to ask about anna even of this peasant " at home for sure " say the peasant shift from one bare foot to the other and leave a distinct print of five toe and a heel in the dust " sure to be at home " he repeat evidently eager to talk " only yesterday visitor arrive there ’ a sight of visitor come what do you want " he turn round and call to a lad who be shout something to he from the cart " oh you all ride by here not long since to look at a reaping machine they ’ll be home by now and who will you be belong to " " we ’ve come a long way " say the coachman climb onto the box " so it ’ not far " " I tell you it ’ just here as soon as you get out " he say keep hold all the while of the carriage a healthylooking broadshouldered young fellow come up too " what be it laborer they want for the harvest " he ask " I do not know my boy " " so you keep to the left and you ’ll come right on it " say the peasant unmistakably loth to let the traveler go and eager to converse the coachman start the horse but they be only just turn off when the peasant shout " stop hi friend stop " call the two voice the coachman stop " they ’re come they ’re yonder " shout the peasant " see what a turnout " he say point to four person on horseback and two in a charàbanc come along the road they be vronsky with a jockey veslovsky and anna on horseback and princess varvara and sviazhsky in the charàbanc they have go out to look at the working of a new reaping machine when the carriage stop the party on horseback be come at a walking pace anna be in front beside veslovsky anna quietly walk her horse a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail her beautiful head with her black hair stray loose under her high hat her full shoulder her slender waist in her black riding habit and all the ease and grace of her deportment impress dolly for the first minute it seem to she unsuitable for anna to be on horseback the conception of ride on horseback for a lady be in darya alexandrovna ’s mind associate with idea of youthful flirtation and frivolity which in her opinion be unbecoming in anna ’s position but when she have scrutinize she see she close she be at once reconcile to her ride in spite of her elegance everything be so simple quiet and dignified in the attitude the dress and the movement of anna that nothing could have be more natural beside anna on a hotlooking gray cavalry horse be vassenka veslovsky in his scotch cap with float ribbon his stout leg stretch out in front obviously pleased with his own appearance darya alexandrovna could not suppress a goodhumored smile as she recognize he behind ride vronsky on a dark bay mare obviously heated from gallop he be hold she in pull at the rein after he ride a little man in the dress of a jockey sviazhsky and princess varvara in a new charàbanc with a big ravenblack trot horse overtake the party on horseback anna ’s face suddenly beam with a joyful smile at the instant when in the little figure huddle in a corner of the old carriage she recognize dolly she utter a cry start in the saddle and set her horse into a gallop on reach the carriage she jump off without assistance and hold up her riding habit she run up to greet dolly " I think it be you and dare not think it how delightful you can not fancy how glad I be " she say at one moment press her face against dolly and kiss she and at the next hold she off and examine she with a smile " here ’ a delightful surprise alexey " she say look round at vronsky who have dismount and be walk towards they vronsky take off his tall gray hat go up to dolly " you would not believe how glad we be to see you " he say give peculiar significance to the word and show his strong white tooth in a smile vassenka veslovsky without get off his horse take off his cap and greet the visitor by gleefully wave the ribbon over his head " that ’ princess varvara " anna say in reply to a glance of inquiry from dolly as the charàbanc drive up " ah " say darya alexandrovna and unconsciously her face betray her dissatisfaction princess varvara be her husband ’s aunt and she have long know she and do not respect she she know that princess varvara have pass her whole life toady on her rich relation but that she should now be sponge on vronsky a man who be nothing to her mortify dolly on account of her kinship with her husband anna notice dolly ’s expression and be disconcerted by it she blush drop her riding habit and stumble over it darya alexandrovna go up to the charàbanc and coldly greet princess varvara sviazhsky too she know he inquire how his queer friend with the young wife be and run his eye over the illmatched horse and the carriage with its patched mudguard propose to the lady that they should get into the charàbanc " and I ’ll get into this vehicle " he say " the horse be quiet and the princess drive capitally " " no stay as you be " say anna come up " and we ’ll go in the carriage " and take dolly ’s arm she draw she away darya alexandrovna ’s eye be fairly dazzle by the elegant carriage of a pattern she have never see before the splendid horse and the elegant and gorgeous people surround she but what strike she most of all be the change that have take place in anna whom she know so well and love any other woman a less close observer not know anna before or not have think as darya alexandrovna have be think on the road would not have notice anything special in anna but now dolly be strike by that temporary beauty which be only find in woman during the moment of love and which she see now in anna ’s face everything in her face the clearly mark dimple in her cheek and chin the line of her lip the smile which as it be flutter about her face the brilliance of her eye the grace and rapidity of her movement the fulness of the note of her voice even the manner in which with a sort of angry friendliness she answer veslovsky when he ask permission to get on her cob so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost — it be all peculiarly fascinating and it seem as if she be herself aware of it and rejoice in it when both the woman be seat in the carriage a sudden embarrassment come over both of they anna be disconcert by the intent look of inquiry dolly fix upon she dolly be embarrassed because after sviazhsky ’s phrase about " this vehicle " she could not help feel ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which anna be sit with she the coachman philip and the countinghouse clerk be experience the same sensation the countinghouse clerk to conceal his confusion busy himself settle the lady but philip the coachman become sullen and be brace himself not to be overawe in future by this external superiority he smile ironically look at the raven horse and be already decide in his own mind that this smart trotter in the charàbanc be only good for promenage and would not do thirty mile straight off in the heat the peasant have all get up from the cart and be inquisitively and mirthfully stare at the meeting of the friend make their comment on it " they ’re pleased too have not see each other for a long while " say the curlyheaded old man with the bast round his hair " I say uncle gerasim if we could take that raven horse now to cart the corn that ' ud be quick work " " lookee be that a woman in breech " say one of they point to vassenka veslovsky sit in a side saddle " nay a man see how smartly he ’ go it " " eh lad seem we ’re not go to sleep then " " what chance of sleep today " say the old man with a sidelong look at the sun " midday ’s past lookee get your hook and come along " anna look at dolly ’s thin careworn face with its wrinkle fill with dust from the road and she be on the point of say what she be think that be that dolly have get thin but conscious that she herself have grow handsome and that dolly ’s eye be tell she so she sigh and begin to speak about herself " you be look at I " she say " and wonder how I can be happy in my position well it ’ shameful to confess but I   I ’m inexcusably happy something magical have happen to I like a dream when you ’re frightened panicstricken and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horror be no more I

later what ’ this what be all these building " she ask want to change the conversation and point to the red and green roof that come into view behind the green hedge of acacia and lilac " quite a little town " but anna do not answer " no no how do you look at my position what do you think of it " she ask " I consider " darya alexandrovna be begin but at that instant vassenka veslovsky have bring the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost gallop past they bump heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle " he ’ do it anna arkadyevna " he shout anna do not even glance at he but again it seem to darya alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage and so she cut short her thought " I do not think anything " she say " but I always love you and if one love anyone one love the whole person just as they be and not as one would like they to be " anna take her eye off her friend ’s face and drop her eyelid this be a new habit dolly have not see in she before ponder try to penetrate the full significance of the word and obviously interpret they as she would have wish she glance at dolly " if you have any sin " she say " they would all be forgive you for your come to see I and these word " and dolly see that tear stand in her eye she press anna ’s hand in silence " well what be these building how many there

peasant ask he for some meadowland I think it be at a cheap rate and he refuse and I accuse he of be miserly of course it be not really because of that but everything together he begin this hospital

have have nothing change outside " " how beautiful " say dolly look with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with column stand out among the differentcolored green of the old tree in the garden " be not it fine and from the house from the top the view be wonderful " they drive into a courtyard strew with gravel and bright with flower in which two laborer be at work put an edging of

be need be more full of luxury than any in which dolly have ever stay a luxury that remind she of the good hotel abroad " well darling how happy I be " anna say sit down in her riding habit for a moment beside dolly " tell I about all of you stiva I have only a glimpse of and he can not tell one about the child how be my favorite tanya quite a big girl I expect " " yes she ’ very tall " darya

glad you will see I as I be the chief thing I should not like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything I do not want to prove anything I merely want to live to do no one harm but myself I have the right to do that have not I but it be a big subject and we ’ll talk over everything properly later now I ’ll go and dress and send a maid to you " leave alone darya alexandrovna with a good housewife ’s eye scan her room all she have see in enter the house and walk through it and all she see now in her room give she an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern european luxury of which she have only read in english novel but have never see in russia and in the country everything be new from the new french hanging on the wall to the carpet which cover the whole floor the bed have a spring mattress and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcase on the little pillow the marble washstand the dressing table the little sofa the table the bronze clock on the chimney piece the window curtain and the portière be all new and expensive the smart maid who come in to offer her service with her hair do up high and a gown more fashionable than dolly ’s be as new and expensive as the whole room darya alexandrovna like her neatness her deferential and obliging manner but she feel ill at ease with she she feel ashamed of she see the patched dressing jacket that have unluckily be pack by mistake for she she be ashamed of the very patch and darned place of which she have be so proud at home at home it have be so clear that for six dressing jacket there would be need twentyfour yard of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard which be a matter of thirty shilling besides the cuttingout and making and these thirty shilling have be save but before the maid she feel if not exactly ashamed at least uncomfortable darya alexandrovna have a great sense of relief when annushka whom she have know for year walk in the smart maid be send for to go to her mistress and annushka remain with darya alexandrovna annushka be obviously much pleased at that lady ’s arrival and begin to chatter away without a pause dolly observe that she be long to express her opinion in regard to her mistress ’s position especially as to the love and devotion of the count to anna arkadyevna but dolly carefully interrupt she whenever she begin to speak about this " I grow up with anna arkadyevna my lady ’s dear to I than anything well it ’ not for we to judge and to be sure there seem so much love " " kindly pour out the water for I to wash now please " darya alexandrovna cut she short " certainly we ’ve two woman keep specially for wash small thing but most of the linen ’ do by machinery the count go into everything himself ah what a husband " dolly be glad when anna come in and by her entrance put a stop to annushka ’s gossip anna have put on a very simple batiste gown dolly scrutinize that simple gown attentively she know what it mean and the price at which such simplicity be obtain " an old friend " say anna of annushka anna be not embarrassed now she be perfectly composed and at ease dolly see that she have now completely recover from the impression her arrival have make on she and have assume that superficial careless tone which as it be close the door on that compartment in which her deep feeling and idea be keep " well anna and how be your little girl " ask dolly " annie " this be what she call her little daughter anna " very well she have get on wonderfully would you like to see she come I ’ll show she to you we have a terrible bother " she begin tell she " over nurse we have an italian wetnurse a good creature but so stupid we want to get rid of she but the baby be so used to she that we ’ve go on keep she still " " but how have you manage " dolly be begin a question as to what name the little girl would have but notice a sudden frown on anna ’s face she change the drift of her question " how do you manage have you wean she yet " but anna have understand " you do not mean to ask that you mean to ask about her surname yes that worry alexey she have no name — that is she ’ a karenina " say anna drop her eyelid till nothing could be see but the eyelash meet " but we ’ll talk about all that later " her face suddenly brighten " come I ’ll show you she elle est très gentille she crawl now " in the nursery the luxury which have impress dolly in the whole house strike she still more there be little gocart order from england and appliance for learn to walk and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table purposely construct for crawling and swing and bath all of special pattern and modern they be all english solid and of good make and obviously very expensive the room be large and very light and lofty when they go in the baby with nothing on but her little smock be sit in a little elbow chair at the table have her dinner of broth which she be spill all over her little chest the baby be be feed and the russian nursery maid be evidently share her meal neither the wetnurse nor the headnurse be there they be in the next room from which come the sound of their conversation in the queer french which be their only means of communication hear anna ’s voice a smart tall english nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walk in at the door hurriedly shake her fair curl and immediately begin to defend herself though anna have not find fault with she at every word anna say the english nurse say hurriedly several time " yes my lady " the rosy baby with her black eyebrow and hair her sturdy red little body with tight gooseflesh skin delight darya alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stare at the stranger she positively envy the baby ’s healthy appearance she be delighted too at the baby ’s crawl not one of her own child have crawl like that when the baby be put on the carpet and its little dress tuck up behind it be wonderfully charming look round like some little wild animal at the grownup big people with her bright black eye she smile unmistakably pleased at their admire she and hold her leg sideways she press vigorously on her arm and rapidly draw her whole back up after and then make another step forward with her little arm but the whole atmosphere of the nursery and especially the english nurse darya alexandrovna do not like at all it be only on the supposition that no good nurse would have enter so irregular a household as anna ’s that darya alexandrovna could explain to herself how anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing disreputablelooking woman as nurse to her child besides from a few word that be drop darya alexandrovna see at once that anna the two nurse and the child have no common existence and that the mother ’s visit be something exceptional anna want to get the baby her plaything and could not find it most amazing of all be the fact that on be ask how many tooth the baby have anna answer wrong and know nothing about the two last tooth " I sometimes feel sorry I ’m so superfluous here " say anna go out of the nursery and hold up her skirt so as to escape the plaything stand in the doorway " it be very different with my first child " " I expect it to be the other way " say darya alexandrovna shyly " oh no by the way do you know I see seryozha " say anna screw up her eye as though look at something far away " but we ’ll talk about that later you would not believe it I ’m like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner be set before she and she do not know what to begin on first the dinner be you and the talk I have before I with you which I could never have with anyone else and I do not know which subject to begin upon first mais je ne vous ferai grâce de rien I must have everything out with you " " oh I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with we " she go on " I ’ll begin with the lady princess varvara — you know she and I know your opinion and stiva ’ about she stiva say the whole aim of her existence be to prove her superiority over auntie katerina pavlovna that ’ all true but she ’ a goodnatured woman and I be so grateful to she in petersburg there be a moment when a chaperon be absolutely essential for I then she turn up but really she be goodnatured she do a great deal to alleviate my position I see you do not understand all the difficulty of my position   there in petersburg " she add " here I ’m perfectly at ease and happy well of that later on though then sviazhsky — he ’ the marshal of the district and he ’ a very good sort of a man but he want to get something out of alexey you understand with his property now that we be settle in the country alexey can exercise great influence then there ’ tushkevitch — you have see he you know — betsy ’s admirer now he ’ be throw over and he ’ come to see we as alexey say he ’ one of those people who be very pleasant if one accept they for what they try to appear to be et puis il est comme il faut as princess varvara say then veslovsky   you know he a very nice boy " she say and a sly smile curve her lip " what ’ this wild story about he and the levins veslovsky tell alexey about it and we do not believe it il est très gentil et naïf " she say again with the same smile " man need occupation and alexey need a circle so I value all these people we have to have the house lively and gay so that alexey may not long for any novelty then you ’ll see the steward — a german a very good fellow and he understand his work alexey have a very high opinion of he then the doctor a young man not quite a nihilist perhaps but you know eat with his knife   but a very good doctor then the architect une petite cour " " here ’ dolly for you princess you be so anxious to see she " say anna come out with darya alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where princess varvara be sit in the shade at an embroidery frame work at a cover for count alexey kirillovitch ’s easy chair " she say she do not want anything before dinner but please order some lunch for she and I ’ll go and look for alexey and bring they all in " princess varvara give dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception and begin at once explain to she that she be live with anna because she have always care more for she than her sister katerina pavlovna the aunt that have bring anna up and that now when everyone have abandon anna she think it her duty to help she in this most difficult period of transition " her husband will give she a divorce and then I shall go back to my solitude but now I can be of use and I be do my duty however difficult it may be for I — not like some other people and how sweet it be of you how right of you to have come they live like the good of marry couple it ’ for god to judge they not for we and do not biryuzovsky and madame avenieva   and sam nikandrov and vassiliev and madame mamonova and liza neptunova do no one say anything about they and it have end by their be receive by everyone and then c’est un intérieur si joli si comme il faut toutàfait à l’anglaise on se réunit le matin au breakfast et puis on se sépare everyone do as he please till dinner time dinner at seven o’clock stiva do very rightly to send you he need their support you know that through his mother and brother he can do anything and then they do so much good he do not tell you about his hospital ce sera admirable — everything from paris " their conversation be interrupt by anna who have find the man of the party in the billiard room and return with they to the terrace there be still a long time before the dinnerhour it be exquisite weather and so several different method of spend the next two hour be propose there be very many method of pass the time at vozdvizhenskoe and these be all unlike those in use at pokrovskoe " une partie de lawntennis " veslovsky propose with his handsome smile " we ’ll be partner again anna arkadyevna " " no it ’ too hot well stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat show darya alexandrovna the river bank " vronsky propose " I agree to anything " say sviazhsky " I imagine that what dolly would like well would be a stroll — wouldn’t you and then the boat perhaps " say anna so it be decide veslovsky and tushkevitch go off to the bathing place promise to get the boat ready and to wait there for they they walk along the path in two couple anna with sviazhsky and dolly with vronsky dolly be a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surrounding in which she find herself abstractly theoretically she do not merely justify she positively approve of anna ’s conduct as be indeed not unfrequent with woman of unimpeachable virtue weary of the monotony of respectable existence at a distance she not only excuse illicit love she positively envy it besides she love anna with all her heart but see anna in actual life among these stranger with this fashionable tone that be so new to darya alexandrovna she feel ill at ease what she dislike particularly be see princess varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comfort she enjoy as a general principle abstractly dolly approve of anna ’s action but to see the man for whose sake her action have be take be disagreeable to she moreover she have never like vronsky she think he very proud and see nothing in he of which he could be proud except his wealth but against her own will here in his own house he overawe she more than ever and she could not be at ease with he she feel with he the same feeling she have have with the maid about her dressing jacket just as with the maid she have feel not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at her darns so she feel with he not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at herself dolly be ill at ease and try to find a subject of conversation even though she suppose that through his pride praise of his house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to he she do all the same tell he how much she like his house " yes it ’ a very fine building and in the good oldfashioned style " he say " I like so much the court in front of the step be that always so " " oh no " he say and his face beam with pleasure " if you could only have see that court last spring " and he begin at first rather diffidently but more and more carry away by the subject as he go on to draw her attention to the various detail of the decoration of his house and garden it be evident that have devote a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home vronsky feel a need to show off the improvement to a new person and be genuinely delighted at darya alexandrovna ’s praise " if you would care to look at the hospital and be not tired indeed it ’ not far shall we go " he say glance into her face to convince himself that she be not bored " be you come anna " he turn to she " we will come will not we " she say address sviazhsky " mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre veslovsky et tushkevitch se morfondre là dans le bateau we must send and tell they " " yes this be a monument he be set up here " say anna turn to dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she have previously talk about the hospital " oh it ’ a work of real importance " say sviazhsky but to show he be not try to ingratiate himself with vronsky he promptly add some slightly critical remark " I wonder though count " he say " that while you do so much for the health of the peasant you take so little interest in the school " " c’est devenu tellement commun les écoles " say vronsky " you understand it ’ not on that account but it just happen so my interest have be divert elsewhere this way then to the hospital " he say to darya alexandrovna point to a turning out of the avenue the lady put up their parasol and turn into the side path after go down several turning and go through a little gate darya alexandrovna see stand on rise ground before she a large pretentiouslooking red building almost finish the iron roof which be not yet paint shine with dazzling brightness in the sunshine beside the finished building another have be begin surround by scaffolding workman in apron stand on scaffold be lay brick pour mortar out of vat and smooth it with trowel " how quickly work get do with you " say sviazhsky " when I be here last time the roof be not on " " by the autumn it will all be ready inside almost everything be do " say anna " and what ’ this new building " " that ’ the house for the doctor and the dispensary " answer vronsky see the architect in a short jacket come towards he and excuse himself to the lady he go to meet he go round a hole where the workman be slake lime he stand still with the architect and begin talk rather warmly " the front be still too low " he say to anna who have ask what be the matter " I say the foundation ought to be raise " say anna " yes of course it would have be much well anna arkadyevna " say the architect " but now it ’ too late " " yes I take a great interest in it " anna answer sviazhsky who be express his surprise at her knowledge of architecture " this new building ought to have be in harmony with the hospital it be an afterthought and be begin without a plan " vronsky have finish his talk with the architect join the lady and lead they inside the hospital although they be still at work on the cornice outside and be paint on the ground floor upstairs almost all the room be finish go up the broad castiron staircase to the landing they walk into the first large room the wall be stucco to look like marble the huge plateglass window be already in only the parquet floor be not yet finish and the carpenter who be plane a block of it leave their work take off the band that fasten their hair to greet the gentry " this be the reception room " say vronsky " here there will be a desk table and bench and nothing more " " this way let we go in here do not go near the window " say anna try the paint to see if it be dry " alexey the paint ’ dry already " she add from the reception room they go into the corridor here vronsky show they the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system then he show they marble bath and bed with extraordinary spring then he show they the ward one after another the storeroom the linen room then the heating stove of a new pattern then the trolley which would make no noise as they carry everything need along the corridor and many other thing sviazhsky as a connoisseur in the late mechanical improvement appreciate everything fully dolly simply wonder at all she have not see before and anxious to understand it all make minute inquiry about everything which give vronsky great satisfaction " yes I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fit hospital in russia " say sviazhsky " and will not you have a lyingin ward " ask dolly " that ’ so much need in the country I have often " in spite of his usual courtesy vronsky interrupt she " this be not a lyingin home but a hospital for the sick and be intend for all disease except infectious complaint " he say " ah look at this " and he roll up to darya alexandrovna an invalid chair that have just be order for the convalescent " look " he sit down in the chair and begin move it " the patient can not walk — still too weak perhaps or something wrong with his leg but he must have air and he move roll himself along " darya alexandrovna be interested by everything she like everything very much but most of all she like vronsky himself with his natural simplehearted eagerness " yes he ’ a very nice good man " she think several time not hear what he say but look at he and penetrate into his expression while she mentally put herself in anna ’s place she like he so much just now with his eager interest that she see how anna could be in love with he " no I think the princess be tired and horse do not interest she " vronsky say to anna who want to go on to the stable where sviazhsky wish to see the new stallion " you go on while I escort the princess home and we ’ll have a little talk " he say " if you would like that " he add turn to she " I know nothing about horse and I shall be delighted " answer darya alexandrovna rather astonish she see by vronsky ’s face that he want something from she she be not mistake as soon as they have pass through the little gate back into the garden he look in the direction anna have take and have make sure that she could neither hear nor see they he begin " you guess that I have something I want to say to you " he say look at she with laugh eye " I be not wrong in believe you to be a friend of anna ’s " he take off his hat and take out his handkerchief wipe his head which be grow bald darya alexandrovna make no answer and merely stare at he with dismay when she be leave alone with he she suddenly feel afraid his laugh eye and stern expression scare she the most diverse supposition as to what he be about to speak of to she flash into her brain " he be go to beg I to come to stay with they with the child and I shall have to refuse or to create a set that will receive anna in moscow or be not it vassenka veslovsky and his relation with anna or perhaps about kitty that he feel he be to blame " all her conjecture be unpleasant but she do not guess what he really want to talk about to she " you have so much influence with anna she be so fond of you " he say " do help I " darya alexandrovna look with timid inquiry into his energetic face which under the limetree be continually be light up in patch by the sunshine and then pass into complete shadow again she wait for he to say more but he walk in silence beside she scratch with his cane in the gravel " you have come to see we you the only woman of anna ’s former friend — I do not count princess varvara — but I know that you have do this not because you regard our position as normal but because understand all the difficulty of the position you still love she and want to be a help to she have I understand you rightly " he ask look round at she " oh yes " answer darya alexandrovna put down her sunshade " but " " no " he break in and unconsciously oblivious of the awkward position into which he be put his companion he stop abruptly so that she have to stop short too " no one feel more deeply and intensely than I do all the difficulty of anna ’s position and that you may well understand if you do I the honor of suppose I have any heart I be to blame for that position and that be why I feel it " " I understand " say darya alexandrovna involuntarily admire the sincerity and firmness with which he say this " but just because you feel yourself responsible you exaggerate it I be afraid " she say " her position in the world be difficult I can well understand " " in the world it be hell " he bring out quickly frown darkly " you can not imagine moral suffering great than what she go through in petersburg in that fortnight   and I beg you to believe it " " yes but here so long as neither anna   nor you miss society " " society " he say contemptuously " how could I miss society " " so far — and it may be so always — you be happy and at peace I see in anna that she be happy perfectly happy she have have time to tell I so much already " say darya alexandrovna smile and involuntarily as she say this at the same moment a doubt enter her mind whether anna really be happy but vronsky it appear have no doubt on that score " yes yes " he say " I know that she have revive after all her suffering she be happy she be happy in the present but I I be afraid of what be before we   I beg your pardon you would like to walk on " " no I do not mind " " well then let we sit here " darya alexandrovna sit down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue he stand up face she " I see that she be happy " he repeat and the doubt whether she be happy sink more deeply into darya alexandrovna ’s mind " but can it last whether we have act rightly or wrongly be another question but the die be cast " he say pass from russian to french " and we be bind together for life we be unite you all the tie of love that we hold most sacred we have a child we may have other child but the law and all the condition of our position be such that thousand of complication arise which she do not see and do not want to see and that one can well understand but I can not help see they my daughter be by law not my daughter but karenin ’s I can not bear this falsity " he say with a vigorous gesture of refusal and he look with gloomy inquiry towards darya alexandrovna she make no answer but simply gaze at he he go on " one day a son may be bear my son and he will be legally a karenin he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property and however happy we may be in our home life and however many child we may have there will be no real tie between we they will be karenins you can understand the bitterness and horror of this position I have try to speak of this to anna it irritate she she do not understand and to she I can not speak plainly of all this now look at another side I be happy happy in her love but I must have occupation I have find occupation and be proud of what I be do and consider it noble than the pursuit of my former companion at court and in the army and most certainly I would not change the work I be do for theirs I be work here settle in my own place and I be happy and contented and we need nothing more to make we happy I love my work here ce n’est pas un pisaller on the contrary " darya alexandrovna notice that at this point in his explanation he grow confused and she do not quite understand this digression but she feel that have once begin to speak of matter near his heart of which he could not speak to anna he be now make a clean breast of everything and that the question of his pursuit in the country fall into the same category of matter near his heart as the question of his relation with anna " well I will go on " he say collect himself " the great thing be that as I work I want to have a conviction that what I be do will not die with I that I shall have heir to come after I — and this I have not conceive the position of a man who know that his child the child of the woman he love will not be his but will belong to someone who hate they and care nothing about they it be awful " he pause evidently much move " yes indeed I see that but what can anna do " query darya alexandrovna " yes that bring I to the object of my conversation " he say calm himself with an effort " anna can it depend on she even to petition the tsar for legitimization a divorce be essential and that depend on anna her husband agree to a divorce — at that time your husband have arrange it completely and now I know he would not refuse it it be only a matter of write to he he say plainly at that time that if she express the desire he would not refuse of course " he say gloomily " it be one of those pharisaical cruelty of which only such heartless man be capable he know what agony any recollection of he must give she and know she he must have a letter from she I can understand that it be agony to she but the matter be of such importance that one must passer pardessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment il y va du bonheur et de l’existence d’anne et de ses enfants I will not speak of myself though it ’ hard for I very hard " he say with an expression as though he be threaten someone for its be hard for he " and so it be princess that I be shamelessly clutch at you as an anchor of salvation help I to persuade she to write to he and ask for a divorce " " yes of course " darya alexandrovna say dreamily as she vividly recall her last interview with alexey alexandrovitch " yes of course " she repeat with decision thinking of anna " use your influence with she make she write I do not like — i’m almost unable to speak about this to she " " very well I will talk to she but how be it she do not think of it herself " say darya alexandrovna and for some reason she suddenly at that point recall anna ’s strange new habit of halfclose her eye and she remember that anna droop her eyelid just when the deep question of life be touch upon " just as though she halfshut her eye to her own life so as not to see everything " think dolly " yes indeed for my own sake and for hers I will talk to she " dolly say in reply to his look of gratitude they get up and walk to the house when anna find dolly at home before she she look intently in her eye as though question she about the talk she have have with vronsky but she make no inquiry in word " I believe it ’ dinner time " she say " we ’ve not see each other at all yet I be reckon on the evening now I want to go and dress I expect you do too we all get splash at the building " dolly go to her room and she feel amused to change her dress be impossible for she have already put on her good dress but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner she ask the maid to brush her dress change her cuff and tie and put some lace on her head " this be all I can do " she say with a smile to anna who come in to she in a third dress again of extreme simplicity " yes we be too formal here " she say as it be apologize for her magnificence " alexey be delighted at your visit as he rarely be at anything he have completely lose his heart to you " she add " you ’re not tired " there be no time for talk about anything before dinner go into the drawingroom they find princess varvara already there and the gentleman of the party in black frockcoat the architect wear a swallowtail coat vronsky present the doctor and the steward to his guest the architect he have already introduce to she at the hospital a stout butler resplendent with a smoothly shave round chin and a starched white cravat announce that dinner be ready and the lady get up vronsky ask sviazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna and himself offer his arm to dolly veslovsky be before tushkevitch in offer his arm to princess varvara so that tushkevitch with the steward and the doctor walk in alone the dinner the diningroom the service the waiting at table the wine and the food be not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout all the house but seem even more sumptuous and modern darya alexandrovna watch this luxury which be novel to she and as a good housekeeper use to manage a household — although she never dream of adapt anything she see to her own household as it be all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living — she could not help scrutinize every detail and wonder how and by whom it be all do vassenka veslovsky her husband and even sviazhsky and many other people she know would never have consider this question and would have readily believe what every wellbred host try to make his guest feel that be that all that be wellordered in his house have cost he the host no trouble whatever but come of itself darya alexandrovna be well aware that even porridge for the child ’s breakfast do not come of itself and that therefore where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury be maintain someone must give earnest attention to its organization and from the glance with which alexey kirillovitch scan the table from the way he nod to the butler and offer darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup she see that it be all organize and maintain by the care of the master of the house himself it be evident that it all rest no more upon anna than upon veslovsky she sviazhsky the princess and veslovsky be equally guest with light heart enjoy what have be arrange for they anna be the hostess only in conduct the conversation the conversation be a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with person present like the steward and the architect belong to a completely different world struggle not to be overawe by an elegance to which they be unaccustomed and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation but this difficult conversation anna direct with her usual tact and naturalness and indeed she do so with actual enjoyment as darya alexandrovna observe the conversation begin about the row tushkevitch and veslovsky have take alone together in the boat and tushkevitch begin describe the last boat race in petersburg at the yacht club but anna seize the first pause at once turn to the architect to draw he out of his silence " nikolay ivanitch be strike " she say mean sviazhsky " at the progress the new building have make since he be here last but I be there every day and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grow " " it ’ firstrate work with his excellency " say the architect with a smile he be respectful and composed though with a sense of his own dignity " it ’ a very different matter to have to do with the district authority where one would have to write out sheaf of paper here I call upon the count and in three word we settle the business " " the american way of do business " say sviazhsky with a smile " yes there they build in a rational fashion " the conversation pass to the misuse of political power in the united states but anna quickly bring it round to another topic so as to draw the steward into talk " have you ever see a reap machine " she say address darya alexandrovna " we have just ride over to look at one when we meet it ’ the first time I ever see one " " how do they work " ask dolly " exactly like little scissor a plank and a lot of little scissor like this " anna take a knife and fork in her beautiful white hand cover with ring and begin show how the machine work it be clear that she see nothing would be understand from her explanation but aware that her talk be pleasant and her hand beautiful she go on explain " more like little penknife " veslovsky say playfully never take his eye off she anna give a just perceptible smile but make no answer " be not it true karl fedoritch that it ’ just like little scissor " she say to the steward " oh ja " answer the german " es ist ein ganz einfaches ding " and he begin to explain the construction of the machine " it ’ a pity it do not bind too I see one at the vienna exhibition which bind with a wire " say sviazhsky " they would be more profitable in use " " es kommt drauf an der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden " and the german rouse from his taciturnity turn to vronsky " das lässt sich ausrechnen erlaucht " the german be just feel in the pocket where be his pencil and the notebook he always write in but recollect that he be at a dinner and observe vronsky ’s chilly glance he check himself " zu compliziert macht zu viel klopot " he conclude " wünscht man dochots so hat man auch klopots " say vassenka veslovsky mimic the german " j’adore l’allemand " he address anna again with the same smile " cessez " she say with playful severity " we expect to find you in the field vassily semyonitch " she say to the doctor a sicklylooking man " have you be there " " I go there but I have take flight " the doctor answer with gloomy jocoseness " then you ’ve take a good constitutional " " splendid " " well and how be the old woman I hope it ’ not typhus " " typhus it be not but it ’ take a bad turn " " what a pity " say anna and have thus pay the due of civility to her domestic circle she turn to her own friend " it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna " sviazhsky say jestingly " oh no why so " say anna with a smile that betray that she know there be something charming in her disquisition upon the machine that have be notice by sviazhsky this new trait of girlish coquettishness make an unpleasant impression on dolly " but anna arkadyevna ’s knowledge of architecture be marvelous " say tushkevitch " to be sure I hear anna arkadyevna talk yesterday about plinth and dampcourse " say veslovsky " have I get it right " " there ’ nothing marvelous about it when one see and hear so much of it " say anna " but I dare say you do not even know what house be make of " darya alexandrovna see that anna dislike the tone of raillery that exist between she and veslovsky but fall in with it against her will vronsky act in this matter quite differently from levin he obviously attach no significance to veslovsky ’s chattering on the contrary he encourage his jest " come now tell we veslovsky how be the stone hold together " " by cement of course " " bravo and what be cement " " oh some sort of paste   no putty " say veslovsky raise a general laugh the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remain plunge in gloomy silence keep up a conversation that never pause glance off one subject fasten on another and at time sting one or the other to the quick once darya alexandrovna feel wounded to the quick and get so hot that she positively flush and wonder afterwards whether she have say anything extreme or unpleasant sviazhsky begin talk of levin describe his strange view that machinery be simply pernicious in its effect on russian agriculture " I have not the pleasure of know this m levin " vronsky say smile " but most likely he have never see the machine he condemn or if he have see and try any it must have be after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of view can anyone have on such a subject " " turkish view in general " veslovsky say turn to anna with a smile " I can not defend his opinion " darya alexandrovna say fire up " but I can say that he ’ a highly cultivate man and if he be here he would know very well how to answer you though I be not capable of do so " " I like he extremely and we be great friend " sviazhsky say smile goodnaturedly " mais pardon il est un petit peu toqué he maintain for instance that district council and arbitration board be all of no use and he be unwilling to take part in anything " " it ’ our russian apathy " say vronsky pour water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem " we ’ve no sense of the duty our privilege impose upon we and so we refuse to recognize these duty " " I know no man more strict in the performance of his duty " say darya alexandrovna irritated by vronsky ’s tone of superiority " for my part " pursue vronsky who be evidently for some reason or other keenly affect by this conversation " such as I be I be on the contrary extremely grateful for the honor they have do I thank to nikolay ivanitch " he indicate sviazhsky " in elect I a justice of the peace I consider that for I the duty of be present at the session of judge some peasant ' quarrel about a horse be as important as anything I can do and I shall regard it as an honor if they elect I for the district council it ’ only in that way I can pay for the advantage I enjoy as a landowner unluckily they do not understand the weight that the big landowner ought to have in the state " it be strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he be of be right at his own table she think how levin who believe the opposite be just as positive in his opinion at his own table but she love levin and so she be on his side " so we can reckon upon you count for the come election " say sviazhsky " but you must come a little beforehand so as to be on the spot by the eighth if you would do I the honor to stop with I " " I rather agree with your beaufrère " say anna " though not quite on the same ground as he " she add with a smile " I ’m afraid that we have too many of these public duty in these latter day just as in old day there be so many government functionary that one have to call in a functionary for every single thing so now everyone ’ do some sort of public duty alexey have be here now six month and he ’ a member I do believe of five or six different public body du train que cela va the whole time will be waste on it and I ’m afraid that with such a multiplicity of these body they ’ll end in be a mere form how many be you a member of nikolay ivanitch " she turn to sviazhsky—“over twenty I fancy " anna speak lightly but irritation could be discern in her tone darya alexandrovna watch anna and vronsky attentively detect it instantly she notice too that as she speak vronsky ’s face have immediately take a serious and obstinate expression notice this and that princess varvara at once make haste to change the conversation by talk of petersburg acquaintance and remember what vronsky have without apparent connection say in the garden of his work in the country dolly surmise that this question of public activity be connect with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky the dinner the wine the decoration of the table be all very good but it be all like what darya alexandrovna have see at formal dinner and ball which of late year have become quite unfamiliar to she it all have the same impersonal and constrained character and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friend it make a disagreeable impression on she after dinner they sit on the terrace then they proceed to play lawn tennis the player divide into two party stand on opposite side of a tightly draw net with gilt pole on the carefully level and roll croquetground darya alexandrovna make an attempt to play but it be a long time before she could understand the game and by the time she do understand it she be so tired that she sit down with princess varvara and simply look on at the player her partner tushkevitch give up play too but the other keep the game up for a long time sviazhsky and vronsky both play very well and seriously they keep a sharp lookout on the ball serve to they and without haste or get in each other ’s way they run adroitly up to they wait for the rebound and neatly and accurately return they over the net veslovsky play worse than the other he be too eager but he keep the player lively with his high spirit his laughter and outcry never pause like the other man of the party with the lady ' permission he take off his coat and his solid comely figure in his white shirtsleeve with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movement make a picture that imprint itself vividly on the memory when darya alexandrovna lie in bed that night as soon as she close her eye she see vassenka veslovsky fly about the croquet ground during the game darya alexandrovna be not enjoy herself she do not like the light tone of raillery that be keep up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna and the unnaturalness altogether of grownup people all alone without child play at a child ’s game but to avoid break up the party and to get through the time somehow after a rest she join the game again and pretend to be enjoy it all that day it seem to she as though she be act in a theater with actor clever than she and that her bad acting be spoil the whole performance she have come with the intention of stay two day if all go well but in the evening during the game she make up her mind that she would go home next day the maternal care and worry which she have so hate on the way now after a day spend without they strike she in quite another light and tempt she back to they when after evening tea and a row by night in the boat darya alexandrovna go alone to her room take off her dress and begin arrange her thin hair for the night she have a great sense of relief it be positively disagreeable to she to think that anna be come to see she immediately she long to be alone with her own thought dolly be want to go to bed when anna come in to see she attire for the night in the course of the day anna have several time begin to speak of matter near her heart and every time after a few word she have stop " afterwards by ourselves we ’ll talk about everything I ’ve get so much I want to tell you " she say now they be by themselves and anna do not know what to talk about she sit in the window look at dolly and go over in her own mind all the store of intimate talk which have seem so inexhaustible beforehand and she find nothing at that moment it seem to she that everything have be say already " well what of kitty " she say with a heavy sigh look penitently at dolly " tell I the truth dolly be not she angry with I " " angry oh no " say darya alexandrovna smile " but she hate I despise I " " oh no but you know that sort of thing be not forgive " " yes yes " say anna turn away and look out of the open window " but I be not to blame and who be to blame what ’ the meaning of be to blame could it have be otherwise what do you think could it possibly have happen that you do not become the wife of stiva " " really I do not know but this be what I want you to tell I " " yes yes but we ’ve not finish about kitty be she happy he ’ a very nice man they say " " he ’ much more than very nice I do not know a well man " " ah how glad I be I ’m so glad much more than very nice " she repeat dolly smile " but tell I about yourself we ’ve a great deal to talk about and I ’ve have a talk with " dolly do not know what to call he she feel it awkward to call he either the count or alexey kirillovitch " with alexey " say anna " I know what you talk about but I want to ask you directly what you think of I of my life " " how be I to say like that straight off I really do not know " " no tell I all the same you see my life but you must not forget that you ’re see we in the summer when you have come to we and we be not alone but we come here early in the spring live quite alone and shall be alone again and I desire nothing well but imagine I live alone without he alone and that will be   I see by everything that it will often be repeat that he will be half the time away from home " she say get up and sit down close by dolly " of course " she interrupt dolly who would have answer " of course I will not try to keep he by force I do not keep he indeed the race be just come his horse be run he will go I ’m very glad but think of I fancy my position but what ’ the use of talk about it " she smile " well what do he talk about with you " " he speak of what I want to speak about of myself and it ’ easy for I to be his advocate of whether there be not a possibility   whether you could not " darya alexandrovna hesitate " correct improve your position you know how I look at it but all the same if possible you should get marry " " divorce you mean " say anna " do you know the only woman who come to see I in petersburg be betsy tverskaya you know she of course au fond c’est la femme la plus depravée qui existe she have an intrigue with tushkevitch deceive her husband in the base way and she tell I that she do not care to know I so long as my position be irregular do not imagine I would compare   I know you darling but I could not help remember well so what do he say to you " she repeat " he say that he be unhappy on your account and his own perhaps you will say that it ’ egoism but what a legitimate and noble egoism he want first of all to legitimize his daughter and to be your husband to have a legal right to you " " what wife what slave can be so utterly a slave as I in my position " she put in gloomily " the chief thing he desire   he desire that you should not suffer " " that ’ impossible well " " well and the most legitimate desire — he wish that your child should have a name " " what child " anna say not look at dolly and half close her eye " annie and those to come " " he need not trouble on that score I shall have no more child " " how can you tell that you will not " " I shall not because I do not wish it " and in spite of all her emotion anna smile as she catch the naïve expression of curiosity wonder and horror on dolly ’s face " the doctor tell I after my illness " " impossible " say dolly open her eye wide for she this be one of those discovery the consequence and deduction from which be so immense that all that one feel for the first instant be that it be impossible to take it all in and that one will have to reflect a great great deal upon it this discovery suddenly throw light on all those family of one or two child which have hitherto be so incomprehensible to she arouse so many idea reflection and contradictory emotion that she have nothing to say and simply gaze with wideopen eye of wonder at anna this be the very thing she have be dream of but now learn that it be possible she be horrified she feel that it be too simple a solution of too complicated a problem " n’estce pas immoral " be all she say after a brief pause " why so think I have a choice between two alternative either to be with child that be an invalid or to be the friend and companion of my husband — practically my husband " anna say in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous " yes yes " say darya alexandrovna hear the very argument she have use to herself and not find the same force in they as before " for you for other people " say anna as though divine her thought " there may be reason to hesitate but for I you must consider I be not his wife he love I as long as he love I and how be I to keep his love not like this " she move her white hand in a curve before her waist with extraordinary rapidity as happen during moment of excitement idea and memory rush into darya alexandrovna ’s head " I " she think " do not keep my attraction for stiva he leave I for other and the first woman for whom he betray I do not keep he by be always pretty and lively he desert she and take another and can anna attract and keep count vronsky in that way if that be what he look for he will find dress and manner still more attractive and charming and however white and beautiful her bare arm be however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curl he will find something well still just as my disgusting pitiful and charming husband do " dolly make no answer she merely sigh anna notice this sigh indicate dissent and she go on in her armory she have other argument so strong that no answer could be make to they " do you say that it ’ not right but you must consider " she go on " you forget my position how can I desire child I ’m not speak of the suffering I ’m not afraid of that think only what be my child to be illfate child who will have to bear a stranger ’s name for the very fact of their birth they will be force to be ashamed of their mother their father their birth " " but that be just why a divorce be necessary " but anna do not hear she she long to give utterance to all the argument with which she have so many time convince herself " what be reason give I for if I be not to use it to avoid bring unhappy being into the world " she look at dolly but without wait for a reply she go on " I should always feel I have wrong these unhappy child " she say " if they be not at any rate they be not unhappy while if they be unhappy I alone should be to blame for it " these be the very argument darya alexandrovna have use in her own reflection but she hear they without understand they " how can one wrong creature that do not exist " she think and all at once the idea strike she could it possibly under any circumstance have be well for her favorite grisha if he have never exist and this seem to she so wild so strange that she shake her head to drive away this tangle of whirl mad idea " no I do not know it ’ not right " be all she say with an expression of disgust on her face " yes but you must not forget that you and I and besides that " add anna in spite of the wealth of her argument and the poverty of dolly ’s objection seem still to admit that it be not right " do not forget the chief point that I be not now in the same position as you for you the question be do you desire not to have any more child while for I it be do I desire to have they and that ’ a great difference you must see that I can not desire it in my position " darya alexandrovna make no reply she suddenly feel that she have get far away from anna that there lie between they a barrier of question on which they could never agree and about which it be well not to speak " then there be all the more reason for you to legalize your position if possible " say dolly " yes if possible " say anna speak all at once in an utterly different tone subdued and mournful " surely you do not mean a divorce be impossible I be tell your husband have consent to it " " dolly I do not want to talk about that " " oh we will not then " darya alexandrovna hasten to say notice the expression of suffering on anna ’s face " all I see be that you take too gloomy a view of thing " " I not at all I ’m always bright and happy you see je fais des passions veslovsky " " yes to tell the truth I do not like veslovsky ’s tone " say darya alexandrovna anxious to change the subject " oh that ’ nonsense it amuse alexey and that ’ all but he ’ a boy and quite under my control you know I turn he as I please it ’ just as it might be with your grisha dolly”—she suddenly change the subject—“you say I take too gloomy a view of thing you can not understand it ’ too awful I try not to take any view of it at all " " but I think you ought to you ought to do all you can " " but what can I do nothing you tell I to marry alexey and say I do not think about it I do not think about it " she repeat and a flush rise into her face she get up straighten her chest and sigh heavily with her light step she begin pace up and down the room stop now and then " I do not think of it not a day not an hour pass that I do not think of it and blame myself for think of it   because think of that may drive I mad drive I mad " she repeat " when I think of it I can not sleep without morphine but never mind let we talk quietly they tell I divorce in the first place he will not give I a divorce he ’ under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now " darya alexandrovna sit erect on a chair turn her head follow anna with a face of sympathetic suffering " you ought to make the attempt " she say softly " suppose I make the attempt what do it mean " she say evidently give utterance to a thought a thousand time think over and learn by heart " it mean that I hate he but still recognize that I have wrong he — and I consider he magnanimous — that I humiliate myself to write to he well suppose I make the effort I do it either I receive a humiliating refusal or consent well I have receive his consent say " anna be at that moment at the furth end of the room and she stop there do something to the curtain at the window " I receive his consent but my   my son they will not give he up to I he will grow up despise I with his father whom I ’ve abandon do you see I love   equally I think but both more than myself — two creature seryozha and alexey " she come out into the middle of the room and stand face dolly with her arm press tightly across her chest in her white dressing gown her figure seem more than usually grand and broad she bend her head and with shining wet eye look from under her brow at dolly a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap shake all over with emotion " it be only those two creature that I love and one exclude the other I can not have they together and that ’ the only thing I want and since I can not have that I do not care about the rest I do not care about anything anything and it will end one way or another and so I can not I do not like to talk of it so do not blame I do not judge I for anything you can not with your pure heart understand all that I ’m suffer " she go up sit down beside dolly and with a guilty look peep into her face and take her hand " what be you think what be you think about I do not despise I I do not deserve contempt I ’m simply unhappy if anyone be unhappy I be " she articulate and turn away she burst into tear leave alone darya alexandrovna say her prayer and go to bed she have feel for anna with all her heart while she be speak to she but now she could not force herself to think of she the memory of home and of her child rise up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to she with a sort of new brilliance that world of her own seem to she now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she make up her mind that she would certainly go back next day anna meantime go back to her boudoir take a wineglass and drop into it several drop of a medicine of which the principal ingredient be morphine after drink it off and sit still a little while she go into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind when she go into the bedroom vronsky look intently at she he be look for trace of the conversation which he know that stay so long in dolly ’s room she must have have with she but in her expression of restrained excitement and of a sort of reserve he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitch he afresh though he be used to it the consciousness of it and the desire that it should affect he he do not want to ask she what they have be talk of but he hope that she would tell he something of her own accord but she only say " I be so glad you like dolly you do do not you " " oh I ’ve know she a long while you know she ’ very goodhearted I suppose mais excessivement terreàterre still I ’m very glad to see she " he take anna ’s hand and look inquiringly into her eye misinterpret the look she smile to he next morning in spite of the protest of her host darya alexandrovna prepare for her homeward journey levin ’s coachman in his by no means new coat and shabby hat with his illmatched horse and his coach with the patched mudguard drive with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach darya alexandrovna dislike take leave of princess varvara and the gentleman of the party after a day spend together both she and her host be distinctly aware that they do not get on together and that it be well for they not to meet only anna be sad she know that now from dolly ’s departure no one again would stir up within her soul the feeling that have be rouse by their conversation it hurt she to stir up these feeling but yet she know that that be the good part of her soul and that that part of her soul would quickly be smother in the life she be lead as she drive out into the open country darya alexandrovna have a delightful sense of relief and she feel tempt to ask the two man how they have like be at vronsky ’s when suddenly the coachman philip express himself unasked " roll in wealth they may be but three pot of oats be all they give we everything clear up till there be not a grain leave by cockcrow what be three pot a mere mouthful and oats now down to fortyfive kopeck at our place no fear all comer may have as much as they can eat " " the master ’ a screw " put in the countinghouse clerk " well do you like their horse " ask dolly " the horse — there ’ no two opinion about they and the food be good but it seem to I sort of dreary there darya alexandrovna I do not know what you think " he say turn his handsome goodnatured face to she " I think so too well shall we get home by evening " " eh we must " on reach home and find everyone entirely satisfactory and particularly charming darya alexandrovna begin with great liveliness tell they how she have arrive how warmly they have receive she of the luxury and good taste in which the vronskys live and of their recreation and she would not allow a word to be say against they " one have to know anna and vronsky — I have get to know he well now — to see how nice they be and how touching " she say speak now with perfect sincerity and forget the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she have experience there vronsky and anna spend the whole summer and part of the winter in the country live in just the same condition and still take no step to obtain a divorce it be an understand thing between they that they should not go away anywhere but both feel the long they live alone especially in the autumn without guest in the house that they could not stand this existence and that they would have to alter it their life be apparently such that nothing well could be desire they have the full abundance of everything they have a child and both have occupation anna devote just as much care to her appearance when they have no visitor and she do a great deal of reading both of novel and of what serious literature be in fashion she order all the book that be praise in the foreign paper and review she receive and read they with that concentrated attention which be only give to what be read in seclusion moreover every subject that be of interest to vronsky she study in book and special journal so that he often go straight to she with question relate to agriculture or architecture sometimes even with question relate to horsebreeding or sport he be amazed at her knowledge her memory and at first be disposed to doubt it to ask for confirmation of her fact and she would find what he ask for in some book and show it to he the building of the hospital too interest she she do not merely assist but plan and suggest a great deal herself but her chief thought be still of herself — how far she be dear to vronsky how far she could make up to he for all he have give up vronsky appreciate this desire not only to please but to serve he which have become the sole aim of her existence but at the same time he weary of the love snare in which she try to hold he fast as time go on and he see himself more and more often hold fast in these snare he have an ever grow desire not so much to escape from they as to try whether they hinder his freedom have it not be for this grow desire to be free not to have scene every time he want to go to the town to a meeting or a race vronsky would have be perfectly satisfied with his life the rôle he have take up the rôle of a wealthy landowner one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the russian aristocracy be entirely to his taste and now after spend six month in that character he derive even great satisfaction from it and his management of his estate which occupy and absorb he more and more be most successful in spite of the immense sum cost he by the hospital by machinery by cow order from switzerland and many other thing he be convince that he be not waste but increase his substance in all matter affect income the sale of timber wheat and wool the letting of land vronsky be hard as a rock and know well how to keep up price in all operation on a large scale on this and his other estate he keep to the simple method involve no risk and in trifle detail he be careful and exacting to an extreme degree in spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the german steward who would try to tempt he into purchase by make his original estimate always far large than really require and then represent to vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper and so make a profit vronsky do not give in he listen to his steward crossexamined he and only agree to his suggestion when the implement to be order or construct be the very new not yet know in russia and likely to excite wonder apart from such exception he resolve upon an increase outlay only where there be a surplus and in make such an outlay he go into the minute detail and insist on get the very good for his money so that by the method on which he manage his affair it be clear that he be not waste but increase his substance in october there be the provincial election in the kashinsky province where be the estate of vronsky sviazhsky koznishev oblonsky and a small part of levin ’s land these election be attract public attention from several circumstance connect with

before there have be almost a quarrel between vronsky and anna over this propose expedition it be the very dull autumn weather which be so dreary in the country and so prepare himself for a struggle vronsky with a hard and cold expression inform anna of his departure as he have never speak to she before but to his surprise anna accept the information with great composure and merely ask when he would be back he look intently at she at a loss to explain this composure she smile at his look he know that way she have of withdraw into herself and know that it only happen when she have determine upon something without let he know her plan he be afraid of this but he be so anxious to avoid a scene that he keep up appearance and half sincerely believe in what he long to believe in — her reasonableness " I hope you will not be dull " " I hope not " say anna " I get a box of book yesterday from gautier ’s no I shall not be dull " " she ’ try to take that tone and so much the well " he think " or else it would be the same thing over and over again " and he set off for the election without appeal to she for a candid explanation it be the first time since the begin of their intimacy that he have part from she without a full explanation from one point of view this trouble he but on the other side he feel that it be well so " at first there will be as this time something undefined keep back and then she will get used to it in any case I can give up anything for she but not my masculine independence " he think in september levin move to moscow for kitty ’s confinement he have spend a whole month in moscow with nothing to do when sergey ivanovitch who have property in the kashinsky province and take great interest in the question of the approach election make ready to set off to the election he invite his brother who have a vote in the seleznevsky district to come with he levin have moreover to transact in kashin some extremely important business relate to the wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister who be abroad levin still hesitate but kitty who see that he be bored in moscow and urge he to go on her own authority order he the proper nobleman ’s uniform cost seven pound and that seven pound pay for the uniform be the chief cause that finally decide levin to go he go to kashin levin have be six day in kashin visit the assembly each day and busily engage about his sister ’s business which still drag on the district marshal of nobility be all occupy with the election and it be impossible to get the simple thing do that depend upon the court of wardship the other matter the payment of the sum due be meet too by difficulty after long negotiation over the legal detail the money be at last ready to be pay but the notary a most obliging person could not hand over the order because it must have the signature of the president and the president though he have not give over his duty to a deputy be at the election all these worrying negotiation this endless go from place to place and talk with pleasant and excellent people who quite see the unpleasantness of the petitioner ’s position but be powerless to assist he — all these effort that yield no result lead to a feeling of misery in levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experience in dream when one try to use physical force he feel this frequently as he talk to his most goodnatured solicitor this solicitor do it seem everything possible and strain every nerve to get he out of his difficulty " I tell you what you might try " he say more than once " go to soandso and soandso " and the solicitor draw up a regular plan for get round the fatal point that hinder everything but he would add immediately " it ’ll mean some delay anyway but you might try it " and levin do try and do go everyone be kind and civil but the point evade seem to crop up again in the end and again to bar the way what be particularly try be that levin could not make out with whom he be struggle to whose interest it be that his business should not be do that no one seem to know the solicitor certainly do not know if levin could have understand why just as he see why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file it would not have be so vexatious and tiresome to he but with the hindrance that confront he in his business no one could explain why they exist but levin have change a good deal since his marriage he be patient and if he could not see why it be all arrange like this he tell himself that he could not judge without know all about it and that most likely it must be so and he try not to fret in attend the election too and take part in they he try now not to judge not to fall foul of they but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which be so earnestly and ardently absorb honest and excellent man whom he respect since his marriage there have be reveal to levin so many new and serious aspect of life that have previously through his frivolous attitude to they seem of no importance that in the question of the election too he assume and try to find some serious significance sergey ivanovitch explain to he the meaning and object of the propose revolution at the election the marshal of the province in whose hand the law have place the control of so many important public function — the guardianship of ward the very department which be give levin so much trouble just now the disposal of large sum subscribe by the nobility of the province the high school female male and military and popular instruction on the new model and finally the district council — the marshal of the province snetkov be a nobleman of the old school — dissipate an immense fortune a goodhearted man honest after his own fashion but utterly without any comprehension of the need of modern day he always take in every question the side of the nobility he be positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education and he succeed in give a purely party character to the district council which ought by right to be of such an immense importance what be need be to put in his place a fresh capable perfectly modern man of contemporary idea and to frame their policy so as from the right confer upon the noble not as the nobility but as an element of the district council to extract all the power of selfgovernment that could possibly be derive from they in the wealthy kashinsky province which always take the lead of other province in everything there be now such a preponderance of force that this policy once carry through properly there might serve as a model for other province for all russia and hence the whole question be of the great importance it be propose to elect as marshal in place of snetkov either sviazhsky or well still nevyedovsky a former university professor a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of sergey ivanovitch the meeting be open by the governor who make a speech to the noble urge they to elect the public functionary not from regard for person but for the service and welfare of their fatherland and hope that the honorable nobility of the kashinsky province would as at all former election hold their duty as sacred and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch when he have finish with his speech the governor walk out of the hall and the nobleman noisily and eagerly — some even enthusiastically — follow he and throng round he while he put on his fur coat and converse amicably with the marshal of the province levin anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything stand there too in the crowd and hear the governor say " please tell marya ivanovna my wife be very sorry she could not come to the home " and thereupon the noble in high goodhumor sort out their fur coat and all drive off to the cathedral in the cathedral levin lift his hand like the rest and repeat the word of the archdeacon swear with most terrible oath to do all the governor have hope they would do church service always affect levin and as he utter the word " I kiss the cross " and glance round at the crowd of young and old man repeat the same he feel touch on the second and third day there be business relate to the finance of the nobility and the female high school of no importance whatever as sergey ivanovitch explain and levin busy see after his own affair do not attend the meeting on the fourth day the auditing of the marshal ’s account take place at the high table of the marshal of the province and then there occur the first skirmish between the new party and the old the committee who have be depute to verify the account report to the meeting that all be in order the marshal of the province get up thank the nobility for their confidence and shed tear the noble give he a loud welcome and shake hand with he but at that instant a nobleman of sergey ivanovitch ’s party say that he have hear that the committee have not verify the account consider such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province one of the member of the committee incautiously admit this then a small gentleman very younglooking but very malignant begin to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditure of the public money and that the misplaced delicacy of the member of the committee be deprive he of this moral satisfaction then the member of the committee try to withdraw their admission and sergey ivanovitch begin to prove that they must logically admit either that they have verify the account or that they have not and he develop this dilemma in detail sergey ivanovitch be answer by the spokesman of the opposite party then sviazhsky speak and then the malignant gentleman again the discussion last a long time and end in nothing levin be surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long especially as when he ask sergey ivanovitch whether he suppose that money have be misappropriate sergey ivanovitch answer " oh no he ’ an honest man but those oldfashioned method of paternal family arrangement in the management of provincial affair must be break down " on the fifth day come the election of the district marshal it be rather a stormy day in several district in the seleznevsky district sviazhsky be elect unanimously without a ballot and he give a dinner that evening the sixth day be fix for the election of the marshal of the province the room large and small be full of nobleman in all sort of uniform many have come only for that day man who have not see each other for year some from the crimea some from petersburg some from abroad meet in the room of the hall of nobility there be much discussion around the governor ’s table under the portrait of the tsar the noble both in the large and the small room group themselves in camp and from their hostile and suspicious glance from the silence that fall upon they when outsider approach a group and from the way that some whisper together retreat to the farth corridor it be evident that each side have secret from the other in appearance the nobleman be sharply divide into two class the old and the new the old be for the most part either in old uniform of the nobility button up closely with spur and hat or in their own special naval cavalry infantry or official uniform the uniform of the old man be embroider in the oldfashioned way with epaulet on their shoulder they be unmistakably tight and short in the waist as though their wearer have grow out of they the young man wear the uniform of the nobility with long waist and broad shoulder unbuttoned over white waistcoat or uniform with black collar and with the embroider badge of justice of the peace to the young man belong the court uniform that here and there brighten up the crowd but the division into young and old do not correspond with the division of party some of the young man as levin observe belong to the old party and some of the very old nobleman on the contrary be whisper with sviazhsky and be evidently ardent partisan of the new party levin stand in the small room where they be smoke and take light refreshment close to his own friend and listen to what they be say he conscientiously exert all his intelligence try to understand what be say sergey ivanovitch be the center round which the other group themselves he be listen at that moment to sviazhsky and hliustov the marshal of another district who belong to their party hliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask snetkov to stand while sviazhsky be persuade he to do so and sergey ivanovitch be approve of the plan levin could not make out why the opposition be to ask the marshal to stand whom they want to supersede stepan arkadyevitch who have just be drink and take some lunch come up to they in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber wipe his lip with a perfumed handkerchief of border batiste " we be place our force " he say pull out his whisker " sergey ivanovitch " and listen to the conversation he support sviazhsky ’s contention " one district ’ enough and sviazhsky ’ obviously of the opposition " he say word evidently intelligible to all except levin " why kostya you here too I suppose you ’re convert eh " he add turn to levin and draw his arm through his levin would have be glad indeed to be convert but could not make out what the point be and retreat a few step from the speaker he explain to stepan arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be ask to stand " o sancta simplicitas " say stepan arkadyevitch and briefly and clearly he explain it to levin if as at previous election all the district ask the marshal of the province to stand then he would be elect without a ballot that must not be now eight district have agree to call upon he if two refuse to do so snetkov might decline to stand at all and then the old party might choose another of their party which would throw they completely out in their reckoning but if only one district sviazhsky ’s do not call upon he to stand snetkov would let himself be ballot for they be even some of they go to vote for he and purposely to let he get a good many vote so that the enemy might be throw off the scent and when a candidate of the other side be put up they too might give he some vote levin understand to some extent but not fully and would have put a few more question when suddenly everyone begin talk and make a noise and they move towards the big room " what be it eh whom " " no guarantee whose what " " they will not pass he " " no guarantee " " they will not let flerov in " " eh because of the charge against he " " why at this rate they will not admit anyone it ’ a swindle " " the law " levin hear exclamation on all side and he move into the big room together with the other all hurry somewhere and afraid of miss something squeeze by the crowd nobleman he draw near the high table where the marshal of the province sviazhsky and the other leader be hotly dispute about something levin be stand rather far off a nobleman breathe heavily and hoarsely at his side and another whose thick boot be creak prevent he from hear distinctly he could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman and then the voice of sviazhsky they be dispute as far as he could make out as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the word " liable to be call up for trial " the crowd part to make way for sergey ivanovitch approach the table sergey ivanovitch wait till the malignant gentleman have finish speak say that he think the good solution would be to refer to the act itself and ask the secretary to find the act the act say that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot sergey ivanovitch read the act and begin to explain its meaning but at that point a tall stout roundshouldered landowner with dye whisker in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck interrupt he he go up to the table and strike it with his finger ring he shout loudly " a ballot put it to the vote no need for more talking " then several voice begin to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the re get more and more exasperated shout more and more loudly but it be impossible to make out what he say he be shout for the very course sergey ivanovitch have propose but it be evident that he hate he and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and rouse in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side shout be raise and for a moment all be confusion so that the marshal of the province have to call for order " a ballot a ballot every nobleman see it we shed our blood for our country the confidence of the monarch no check the account of the marshal he ’ not a cashier but that ’ not the point vote please beastly " shout furious and violent voice on all side look and face be even more violent and furious than their word they express the most implacable hatred levin do not in the least understand what be the matter and he marvel at the passion with which it be dispute whether or not the decision about flerov should be put to the vote he forget as sergey ivanovitch explain to he afterwards this syllogism that it be necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it be necessary to have a majority of vote that to get a majority of vote it be necessary to secure flerov ’s right to vote that to secure the recognition of flerov ’s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act " and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one want to be of use in public life " conclude sergey ivanovitch but levin forget all that and it be painful to he to see all these excellent person for whom he have a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement to escape from this painful feeling he go away into the other room where there be nobody except the waiter at the refreshment bar see the waiter busy over wash up the crockery and set in order their plate and wineglass see their calm and cheerful face levin feel an unexpected sense of relief as though he have come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air he begin walk up and down look with pleasure at the waiter he particularly like the way one graywhiskered waiter who show his scorn for the other young one and be jeer at by they be teach they how to fold up napkin properly levin be just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter when the secretary of the court of wardship a little old man whose specialty it be to know all the nobleman of the province by name and patronymic draw he away " please come konstantin dmitrievitch " he say " your brother ’ look for you they be vote on the legal point " levin walk into the room receive a white ball and follow his brother sergey ivanovitch to the table where sviazhsky be stand with a significant and ironical face hold his beard in his fist and sniff at it sergey ivanovitch put his hand into the box put the ball somewhere and make room for levin stop levin advance but utterly forget what he be to do and much embarrass he turn to sergey ivanovitch with the question " where be I to put it " he ask this softly at a moment when there be talk go on near so that he have hope his question would not be overhear but the person speak pause and his improper question be overhear sergey ivanovitch frown " that be a matter for each man ’s own decision " he say severely several people smile levin crimson hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth and put the ball to the right as it be in his right hand have put it in he recollect that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background " a hundred and twentysix for admission ninetyeight against " sing out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r then there be a laugh a button and two nut be find in the box the nobleman be allow the right to vote and the new party have conquer but the old party do not consider themselves conquer levin hear that they be ask snetkov to stand and he see that a crowd of nobleman be surround the marshal who be say something levin go near in reply snetkov speak of the trust the nobleman of the province have place in he the affection they have show he which he do not deserve as his only merit have be his attachment to the nobility to whom he have devote twelve year of service several time he repeat the word " I have serve to the good of my power with truth and good faith I value your goodness and thank you " and suddenly he stop short from the tear that choke he and go out of the room whether these tear come from a sense of the injustice be do he from his love for the nobility or from the strain of the position he be place in feel himself surround by enemy his emotion infect the assembly the majority be touch and levin feel a tenderness for snetkov in the doorway the marshal of the province jostle against levin " beg pardon excuse I please " he say as to a stranger but recognize levin he smile timidly it seem to levin that he would have like to say something but could not speak for emotion his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosse and white trouser stripe with braid as he move hurriedly along remind levin of some hunt beast who see that he be in evil case this expression in the marshal ’s face be particularly touching to levin because only the day before he have be at his house about his trustee business and have see he in all his grandeur a kindhearted fatherly man the big house with the old family furniture the rather dirty far from stylish but respectful footman unmistakably old house serf who have stick to their master the stout goodnatured wife in a cap with lace and a turkish shawl pet her pretty grandchild her daughter ’s daughter the young son a sixth form high school boy come home from school and greet his father kiss his big hand the genuine cordial word and gesture of the old man — all this have the day before rouse an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in levin this old man be a touching and pathetic figure to levin now and he long to say something pleasant to he " so you ’re sure to be our marshal again " he say " it ’ not likely " say the marshal look round with a scared expression " I ’m worn out I ’m old if there be man young and more deserving than I let they serve " and the marshal disappear through a side door the most solemn moment be at hand they be to proceed immediately to the election the leader of both party be reckon white and black on their finger the discussion upon flerov have give the new party not only flerov ’s vote but have also gain time for they so that they could send to fetch three nobleman who have be render unable to take part in the election by the wile of the other party two noble gentleman who have a weakness for strong drink have be make drunk by the partisan of snetkov and a third have be rob of his uniform on learn this the new party have make haste during the dispute about flerov to send some of their man in a sledge to clothe the strip gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting " I ’ve bring one drench he with water " say the landowner who have go on this errand to sviazhsky " he ’ all right he ’ll do " " not too drunk he will not fall down " say sviazhsky shake his head " no he ’ firstrate if only they do not give he any more here I ’ve tell the waiter not to give he anything on any account " the narrow room in which they be smoke and take refreshment be full of nobleman the excitement grow more intense and every face betray some uneasiness the excitement be specially keen for the leader of each party who know every detail and have reckon up every vote they be the general organize the approach battle the rest like the rank and file before an engagement though they be get ready for the fight seek for other distraction in the interval some be lunch stand at the bar or sit at the table other be walk up and down the long room smoke cigarette and talk with friend whom they have not see for a long while levin do not care to eat and he be not smoke he do not want to join his own friend that be sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sviazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his equerry ’s uniform be stand with they in eager conversation levin have see he already at the meeting on the previous day and he have studiously avoid he not care to greet he he go to the window and sit down scan the group and listen to what be be say around he he feel depressed especially because everyone else be as he see eager anxious and interested and he alone with an old toothless little man with mumbling lip wear a naval uniform sit beside he have no interest in it and nothing to do " he ’ such a blackguard I have tell he so but it make no difference only think of it he could not collect it in three year " he hear vigorously utter by a roundshouldered short country gentleman who have pomade hair hang on his embroidered collar and new boot obviously put on for the occasion with heel that tap energetically as he speak cast a displeased glance at levin this gentleman sharply turn his back " yes it ’ a dirty business there ’ no deny " a small gentleman assent in a high voice next a whole crowd of country gentleman surround a stout general hurriedly come near levin these person be unmistakably seek a place where they could talk without be overhear " how dare he say I have his breech steal pawn they for drink I expect damn the fellow prince indeed he ’d well not say it the beast " " but excuse I they take their stand on the act " be be say in another group " the wife must be register as noble " " oh damn your act I speak from my heart we ’re all gentleman be not we above suspicion " " shall we go on your excellency fine champagne " another group be follow a nobleman who be shout something in a loud voice it be one of the three intoxicated gentleman " I always advise marya semyonovna to let for a fair rent for she can never save a profit " he hear a pleasant voice say the speaker be a country gentleman with gray whisker wear the regimental uniform of an old general staffofficer it be the very landowner levin have meet at sviazhsky ’s he know he at once the landowner too stare at levin and they exchange greeting " very glad to see you to be sure I remember you very well last year at our district marshal nikolay ivanovitch ’s " " well and how be your land do " ask levin " oh still just the same always at a loss " the landowner answer with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be " and how do you come to be in our province " he ask " come to take part in our coup d’état " he say confidently pronounce the french word with a bad accent " all russia ’ here — gentleman of the bedchamber and everything short of the ministry " he point to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevitch in white trouser and his court uniform walk by with a general " I ought to own that I do not very well understand the drift of the provincial election " say levin the landowner look at he " why what be there to understand there ’ no meaning in it at all it ’ a decay institution that go on run only by the force of inertia just look the very uniform tell you that it ’ an assembly of justice of the peace permanent member of the court and so on but not of nobleman " " then why do you come " ask levin " from habit nothing else then too one must keep up connection it ’ a moral obligation of a sort and then to tell the truth there ’ one ’s own interest my soninlaw want to stand as a permanent member they ’re not rich people and he must be bring forward these gentleman now what do they come for " he say point to the malignant gentleman who be talk at the high table " that ’ the new generation of nobility " " new it may be but nobility it be not they ’re proprietor of a sort but we ’re the landowner as nobleman they ’re cut their own throat " " but you say it ’ an institution that ’ serve its time " " that it may be but still it ought to be treat a little more respectfully snetkov now we may be of use or we may not but we ’re the growth of a thousand year if we ’re lay out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you ’ve a tree that ’ stand for century in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you do not cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbed but lay out your bed so as to take advantage of the tree you will not grow he again in a year " he say cautiously and he immediately change the conversation " well and how be your land do " " oh not very well I make five per cent " " yes but you do not reckon your own work be not you worth something too I ’ll tell you my own case before I take to see after the land I have a salary of three hundred pound from the service now I do more work than I do in the service and like you I get five per cent on the land and thank god for that but one ’s work be throw in for nothing " " then why do you do it if it ’ a clear loss " " oh well one do it what would you have it ’ habit and one know it ’ how it should be and what ’ more " the landowner go on lean his elbow on the window and chat on " my son I must tell you have no taste for it there ’ no doubt he ’ll be a scientific man so there ’ll be no one to keep it up and yet one do it here this year I ’ve plant an orchard " " yes yes " say levin " that ’ perfectly true I always feel there ’ no real balance of gain in my work on the land and yet one do it it ’ a sort of duty one feel to the land " " but I tell you what " the landowner pursue " a neighbor of mine a merchant be at my place we walk about the field and the garden ' no ' say he ' stepan vassilievitch everything ’ well look after but your garden ’ neglect ' but as a fact it ’ well keep up ' to my thinking I ’d cut down that limetree here you ’ve thousand of lime and each would make two good bundle of bark and nowadays that bark ’ worth something I ’d cut down the lot ' " " and with what he make he ’d increase his stock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out in lot to the peasant " levin add smile he have evidently more than once come across those commercial calculation " and he ’d make his fortune but you and I must thank god if we keep what we ’ve get and leave it to our child " " you ’re married I ’ve hear " say the landowner " yes " levin answer with proud satisfaction " yes it ’ rather strange " he go on " so we live without make anything as though we be ancient vestal set to keep in a fire " the landowner chuckle under his white mustache " there be some among we too like our friend nikolay ivanovitch or count vronsky that ’ settle here lately who try to carry on their husbandry as though it be a factory but so far it lead to nothing but make away with capital on it " " but why be it we do not do like the merchant why do not we cut down our park for timber " say levin return to a thought that have strike he " why as you say to keep the fire in besides that ’ not work for a nobleman and our work as nobleman be not do here at the election but yonder each in our corner there ’ a class instinct too of what one ought and ought not to do there ’ the peasant too I wonder at they sometimes any good peasant try to take all the land he can however bad the land be he ’ll work it without a return too at a simple loss " " just as we do " say levin " very very glad to have meet you " he add see sviazhsky approach he " and here we ’ve meet for the first time since we meet at your place " say the landowner to sviazhsky " and we ’ve have a good talk too " " well have you be attack the new order of thing " say sviazhsky with a smile " that we ’re bind to do " " you ’ve relieve your feeling " sviazhsky take levin ’s arm and go with he to his own friend this time there be no avoid vronsky he be stand with stepan arkadyevitch and sergey ivanovitch and look straight at levin as he draw near " delighted I believe I ’ve have the pleasure of meet you   at princess shtcherbatskaya ’s " he say give levin his hand " yes I quite remember our meeting " say levin and blush crimson he turn away immediately and begin talk to his brother with a slight smile vronsky go on talk to sviazhsky obviously without the slight inclination to enter into conversation with levin but levin as he talk to his brother be continually look round at vronsky try to think of something to say to he to gloss over his rudeness " what be we wait for now " ask levin look at sviazhsky and vronsky " for snetkov he have to refuse or to consent to stand " answer sviazhsky " well and what have he do consent or not " " that ’ the point that he ’ do neither " say vronsky " and if he refuse who will stand then " ask levin look at vronsky " whoever choose to " say sviazhsky " shall you " ask levin " certainly not I " say sviazhsky look confused and turn an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman who be stand beside sergey ivanovitch " who then nevyedovsky " say levin feel he be put his foot into it but this be bad still nevyedovsky and sviazhsky be the two candidate " I certainly shall not under any circumstance " answer the malignant gentleman this be nevyedovsky himself sviazhsky introduce he to levin " well you find it exciting too " say stepan arkadyevitch wink at vronsky " it ’ something like a race one might bet on it " " yes it be keenly exciting " say vronsky " and once take the thing up one ’ eager to see it through it ’ a fight " he say scowl and set his powerful jaw " what a capable fellow sviazhsky be see it all so clearly " " oh yes " vronsky assent indifferently a silence follow during which vronsky — since he have to look at something — look at levin at his foot at his uniform then at his face and notice his gloomy eye fix upon he he say in order to say something " how be it that you live constantly in the country be not a justice of the peace you be not in the uniform of one " " it ’ because I consider that the justice of the peace be a silly institution " levin answer gloomily he have be all the time look for an opportunity to enter into conversation with vronsky so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting " I do not think so quite the contrary " vronsky say with quiet surprise " it ’ a plaything " levin cut he short " we do not want justice of the peace I ’ve never have a single thing to do with they during eight year and what I have have be decide wrongly by they the justice of the peace be over thirty mile from I for some matter of two rouble I should have to send a lawyer who cost I fifteen " and he relate how a peasant have steal some flour from the miller and when the miller tell he of it have lodge a complaint for slander all this be utterly uncalled for and stupid and levin feel it himself as he say it " oh this be such an original fellow " say stepan arkadyevitch with his most soothing almondoil smile " but come along I think they ’re vote " and they separate " I can not understand " say sergey ivanovitch who have observe his brother ’s clumsiness " I can not understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact that ’ where we russians be so deficient the marshal of the province be our opponent and with he you ’re ami cochon and you beg he to stand count vronsky now   I ’m not make a friend of he he ’ ask I to dinner and I ’m not go but he ’ one of our side — why make an enemy of he then you ask nevyedovsky if he ’ go to stand that ’ not a thing to do " " oh I do not understand it at all and it ’ all such nonsense " levin answer gloomily " you say it ’ all such nonsense but as soon as you have anything to do with it you make a muddle " levin do not answer and they walk together into the big room the marshal of the province though he be vaguely conscious in the air of some trap be prepare for he and though he have not be call upon you all to stand have still make up his mind to stand all be silence in the room the secretary announce in a loud voice that the captain of the guard mihail stepanovitch snetkov would now be ballot for as marshal of the province the district marshal walk carry plate on which be ball from their table to the high table and the election begin " put it in the right side " whisper stepan arkadyevitch as with his brother levin follow the marshal of his district to the table but levin have forget by now the calculation that have be explain to he and be afraid stepan arkadyevitch might be mistaken in say " the right side " surely

happy many be in ecstasy many be disgusted and unhappy the former marshal of the province be in a state of despair which he could not conceal when nevyedovsky go out of the room the crowd throng round he and follow he enthusiastically just as they have follow the governor who have open the meeting and just as they have follow snetkov when he be elect the newly elect marshal and many of the successful party dine that day with vronsky vronsky have come to the election partly because he be bored in the country and want to show anna his right to independence and also to repay sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he have take for vronsky at the district council election but chiefly in order strictly to perform all those duty of a nobleman and landowner which he have take upon himself but he have not in the least expect that the election would so interest he so keenly excite he and that he would be so good at this kind of thing he be quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province but his success be unmistakable and he be not wrong in suppose that he have already obtain a certain influence this influence be due to his wealth and reputation the capital house in the town lend he by his old friend shirkov who have a post in the department of finance and be director of a flourish bank in kashin the excellent cook vronsky have bring from the country and his friendship with the governor who be a schoolfellow of vronsky’s — a schoolfellow he have patronize and protect indeed but what contribute more than all to his success be his direct equable manner with everyone which very quickly make the majority of the nobleman reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness he be himself conscious that except that whimsical gentleman marry to kitty shtcherbatskaya who have à propos de bottes pour out a stream of irrelevant absurdity with such spiteful fury every nobleman with whom he have make acquaintance have become his adherent he see clearly and other people recognize it too that he have do a great deal to secure the success of nevyedovsky and now at his own table celebrate nevyedovsky ’s election he be experience an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate the election itself have so fascinate he that if he could succeed in get marry during the next three year he begin to think of stand himself — much as after win a race ride by a jockey he have long to ride a race himself today he be celebrate the success of his jockey vronsky sat at the head of the table on his right hand sit the young governor a general of high rank to all the rest he be the chief man in the province who have solemnly open the election with his speech and arouse a feeling of respect and even of awe in many people as vronsky see to vronsky he be little katka maslov — that have be his nickname in the page ' corps — whom he feel to be shy and try to mettre à son aise on the left hand sit nevyedovsky with his youthful stubborn and malignant face with he vronsky be simple and deferential sviazhsky take his failure very lightheartedly it be indeed no failure in his eye as he say himself turn glass in hand to nevyedovsky they could not have find a well representative of the new movement which the nobility ought to follow and so every honest person as he say be on the side of today ’s success and be rejoice over it stepan arkadyevitch be glad too that he be have a good time and that everyone be pleased the episode of the election serve as a good occasion for a capital dinner sviazhsky comically imitate the tearful discourse of the marshal and observe address nevyedovsky that his excellency would have to select another more complicated method of audit the account than tear another nobleman jocosely describe how footman in stocking have be order for the marshal ’s ball and how now they would have to be send back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footman in stocking continually during dinner they say of nevyedovsky " our marshal " and " your excellency " this be say with the same pleasure with which a bride be call " madame " and her husband ’s name nevyedovsky affect to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation but it be obvious that he be highly delighted and have to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which be unsuitable to their new liberal tone after dinner several telegram be send to people interested in the result of the election and stepan arkadyevitch who be in high good humor send darya alexandrovna a telegram " nevyedovsky elect by twenty vote congratulation tell people " he dictate it aloud say " we must let they share our rejoicing " darya alexandrovna get the message simply sigh over the rouble waste on

merchant but import direct from abroad be extremely dignified simple and enjoyable the party — some twenty — have be select by sviazhsky from among the more active new liberal all of the same way of thinking who be at the same time clever and well breed they drink also half in jest to the health of the new marshal of the province of the governor of the bank director and of " our amiable host " vronsky be satisfied he have never expect to find so pleasant a tone in the province towards the end of dinner it be still more lively the governor ask vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the servians which his wife who be anxious to make his acquaintance have be get up " there ’ll be a ball and you ’ll see the belle of the province worth see really " " not in my line " vronsky answer he like that english phrase but he smile and promise to come before they rise from the table when all of they be smoke vronsky ’s valet go up to he with a letter on a tray " from vozdvizhenskoe by

letter contain reproach for not be back at the time fix the letter he have send the previous evening have probably not reach she yet the letter be what he have expect but the form of it be unexpected and particularly disagreeable to he " annie be very ill the doctor say it may be inflammation I be lose my head all alone princess varvara be no help but a hindrance I expect you the day before yesterday and yesterday and now I be send to find out where you be and what you be do I want to come myself but think well of it know you would dislike it send some answer that I may know what to do " the child ill yet she have think of come herself their daughter ill and this hostile tone the innocent festivity over the election and this gloomy burdensome love to which he have to return strike vronsky by their contrast but he have to go and by the first train that night he set off home before vronsky ’s departure for the election anna have reflect that the scene constantly repeat between they each time he leave home might only make he cold to she instead of attach he to she and resolve to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure but the cold severe glance with which he have look at she when he come to tell she he be go have wound she and before he have start her peace of mind be destroy in solitude afterwards think over that glance which have express his right to freedom she come as she always do to the same point — the sense of her own humiliation " he have the right to go away when and where he choose not simply to go away but to leave I he have every right and I have none but know that he ought not to do it what have he do though he look at I with a cold severe expression of course that be something indefinable impalpable but it have never be so before and that glance mean a great deal " she think " that glance show the beginning of indifference " and though she feel sure that a coldness be begin there be nothing she could do she could not in any way alter her relation to he just as before only by love and by charm could she keep he and so just as before only by occupation in the day by morphine at night could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he cease to love she it be true there be still one mean not to keep he — for that she want nothing more than his love — but to be near to he to be in such a position that he would not leave she that means be divorce and marriage and she begin to long for that and make up her mind to agree to it the first time he or stiva approach she on the subject absorb in such thought she pass five day without he the five day that he be to be at the election walk conversation with princess varvara visit to the hospital and most of all reading — reading of one book after another — fill up her time but on the sixth day when the coachman come back without he she feel that now she be utterly incapable of stifle the thought of he and of what he be do there just at that time her little girl be take ill anna begin to look after she but even that do not distract her mind especially as the illness be not serious however hard she try she could not love this little child and to feign love be beyond her power towards the evening of that day still alone anna be in such a panic about he that she decide to start for the town but on second thought write he the contradictory letter that vronsky receive and without read it through send it off by a special messenger the next morning she receive his letter and regret her own she dread a repetition of the severe look he have fling at she at parting especially when he know that the baby be not dangerously ill but still she be glad she have write to he at this moment anna be positively admit to herself that she be a burden to he that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to she and in spite of that she be glad he be come let he weary of she but he would be here with she so that she would see he would know of every action he take she be sit in the drawingroom near a lamp with a new volume of taine and as she read listen to the sound of the wind outside and every minute expect the carriage to arrive several time she have fancy she hear the sound of wheel but she have be mistake at last she hear not the sound of wheel but the coachman ’s shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry even princess varvara play patience confirm this and anna flush hotly get up but instead of go down as she have do twice before she stand still she suddenly feel ashamed of her duplicity but even more she dread how he might meet she all feeling of wounded pride have pass now she be only afraid of the expression of his displeasure she remember that her child have be perfectly well again for the last two day she feel positively vexed with she for get well from the very moment her letter be send off then she think of he that he be here all of he with his hand his eye she hear his voice and forget everything she run joyfully to meet he " well how be annie " he say timidly from below look up to anna as she run down to he he be sit on a chair and a footman be pull off his warm overboot " oh she be well " " and you " he say shake himself she take his hand in both of hers and draw it to her waist never take her eye off he " well I ’m glad " he say coldly scan she her hair her dress which he know she have put on for he all be charming but how many time it have charm he and the stern stony expression that she so dread settle upon his face " well I ’m glad and be you well " he say wipe his damp beard with his handkerchief and kiss her hand " never mind " she think " only let he be here and so long as he ’ here he can not he dare not cease to love I " the evening be spend happily and gaily in the presence of princess varvara who complain to he that anna have be take morphine in his absence " what be I to do I could not sleep my thought prevent I when he ’ here I never take it — hardly ever " he tell she about the election and anna know how by adroit question to bring he to what give he most pleasure — his own success she tell he of everything that interest he at home and all that she tell he be of the most cheerful description but late in the evening when they be alone anna see that she have regain complete possession of he want to erase the painful impression of the glance he have give she for her letter she say " tell I frankly you be vexed at get my letter and you do not believe I " as soon as she have say it she feel that however warm his feeling be to she he have not forgive she for that " yes " he say " the letter be so strange first annie ill and then you think of come yourself " " it be all the truth " " oh I do not doubt it " " yes you do doubt it you be vexed I see " " not for one moment I ’m only vexed that ’ true that you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there be duty " " the duty of go to a concert " " but we will not talk about it " he say " why not talk about it " she say " I only mean to say that matter of real importance may turn up now for instance I shall have to go to moscow to arrange about the house oh anna why be you so irritable do not you know that I can not live without you " " if so " say anna her voice suddenly change " it mean that you be sick of this life yes you will come for a day and go away as man do " " anna that ’ cruel I be ready to give up my whole life " but she do not hear he " if you go to moscow I will go too I will not stay here either we must separate or else live together " " why you know that ’ my one desire but for that " " we must get a divorce I will write to he I see I can not go on like this but I will come with you to moscow " " you talk as if you be threaten I but I desire nothing so much as never to be part from you " say vronsky smile but as he say these word there gleam in his eye not merely a cold look but the vindictive look of a man persecute and make cruel she see the look and correctly divine its meaning " if so it ’ a calamity " that glance tell she it be a moment ’s impression but she never forget it anna write to her husband ask he about a divorce and towards the end of november take leave of princess varvara who want to go to petersburg she go with vronsky to moscow expect every day an answer from alexey alexandrovitch and after that the divorce they now establish themselves together like married people the levins have be three month in moscow the date have long pass on which accord to the most trustworthy calculation of people learn in such matter kitty should have be confine but she be still about and there be nothing to show that her time be any near than two month ago the doctor the monthly nurse and dolly and her mother and most of all levin who could not think of the approach event without terror begin to be impatient and uneasy kitty be the only person who feel perfectly calm and happy she be distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child for she to some extent actually exist already and she brood blissfully over this feeling he be not by now altogether a part of herself but sometimes live his own life independently of she often this separate being give she pain but at the same time she want to laugh with a strange new you all the people she love be with she and all be so good to she so attentively care for she so entirely pleasant be everything present to she that if she have not know and feel that it must all soon be over she could not have wish for a well and pleasant life the only thing that spoil the charm of this manner of life be that her husband be not here as she love he to be and as he be in the country she like his serene friendly and hospitable manner in the country in the town he seem continually uneasy and on his guard as though he be afraid someone would be rude to he and still more to she at home in the country know himself distinctly to be in his right place he be never in haste to be off elsewhere he be never unoccupied here in town he be in a continual hurry as though afraid of miss something and yet he have nothing to do and she feel sorry for he to other she know he do not appear an object of pity on the contrary when kitty look at he in society as one sometimes look at those one love try to see he as if he be a stranger so as to catch the impression he must make on other she see with a panic even of jealous fear that he be far indeed from be a pitiable figure that he be very attractive with his fine breeding his rather oldfashioned reserved courtesy with woman his powerful figure and strike as she think and expressive face but she see he not from without but from within she see that here he be not himself that be the only way she could define his condition to herself sometimes she inwardly reproach he for his inability to live in the town sometimes she recognize that it be really hard for he to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with it what have he to do indeed he do not care for card he do not go to a club spend the time with jovial gentleman of oblonsky ’s type — she know now what that mean   it mean drinking and go somewhere after drinking she could not think without horror of where man go on such occasion be he to go into society but she know he could only find satisfaction in that if he take pleasure in the society of young woman and that she could not wish for should he stay at home with she her mother and her sister but much as she like and enjoy their conversation forever on the same subjects—“alinenadine " as the old prince call the sister ' talk — she know it must bore he what be there leave for he to do to go on write at his book he have indeed attempt and at first he use to go to the library and make extract and look up reference for his book but as he tell she the more he do nothing the less time he have to do anything and besides he complain that he have talk too much about his book here and that you all his idea about it be muddled and have lose their interest for he one advantage in this town life be that quarrel hardly ever happen between they here in town whether it be that their condition be different or that they have both become more careful and sensible in that respect they have no quarrel in moscow from jealousy which they have so dread when they move from the country one event an event of great importance to both from that point of view do indeed happen — that be kitty ’s meeting with vronsky the old princess marya borissovna kitty ’s godmother who have always be very fond of she have insist on see her kitty though she do not go into society at all on account of her condition go with her father to see the venerable old lady and there meet vronsky the only thing kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting be that at the instant when she recognize in his civilian dress the feature once so familiar to she her breath fail she the blood rush to her heart and a vivid blush — she feel it — overspread her face but this last only a few second before her father who purposely begin talk in a loud voice to vronsky have finish she be perfectly ready to look at vronsky to speak to he if necessary exactly as she speak to princess marya borissovna and more than that to do so in such a way that everything to the faint intonation and smile would have be approve by her husband whose unseen presence she seem to feel about she at that instant she say a few word to he even smile serenely at his joke about the election which he call " our parliament " she have to smile to show she see the joke but she turn away immediately to princess marya borissovna and do not once glance at he till he get up to go then she look at he but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he be say goodbye she be grateful to her father for say nothing to she about their meet vronsky but she see by his special warmth to she after the visit during their usual walk that he be pleased with she she be pleased with herself she have not expect she would have have the power while keep somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memory of her old feeling for vronsky not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with he levin flush a great deal more than she when she tell he she have meet vronsky at princess marya borissovna ’s it be very hard for she to tell he this but still hard to go on speak of the detail of the meeting as he do not question she but simply gaze at she with a frown " I be very sorry you be not there " she say " not that you be not in the room   I could not have be so natural in your presence   I be blush now much more much much more " she say blush till the tear come into her eye " but that you could not see through a crack " the truthful eye tell levin that she be satisfied with herself and in spite of her blush he be quickly reassure and begin question she which be all she want when he have hear everything even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flush but that afterwards she be just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance levin be quite happy again and say he be glad of it and would not now behave as stupidly as he have do at the election but would try the first time he meet vronsky to be as friendly as possible " it ’ so wretched to feel that there ’ a man almost an enemy whom it ’ painful to meet " say levin " I ’m very very glad " " go please go then and call on the bols " kitty say to her husband when he come in to see she at eleven o’clock before go out " I know you be dine at the club papa put down your name but what be you go to do in the morning " " I be only go to

" oh you would not believe it I ’ve get so out of the way of all this that it make I feel positively ashamed it ’ such a horrible thing to do a complete outsider walk in sit down stay on with nothing to do waste their time and worry himself and walk away " kitty laugh " why I suppose you use to pay call before you be marry do not you " " yes I do but I always feel ashamed and now I ’m so out of the way of it that by jove I ’d soon go two day run without my dinner than pay this call one ’ so ashamed I feel all the while that they ’re annoyed that they ’re say ' what have he come for ' " " no they will not I ’ll answer for that " say kitty look into his face with a laugh she take his hand " well goodbye do go please " he be just go out after kiss his wife ’s hand when she stop he " kostya

hand " let ’s talk about it it worry I I seem to spend nothing unnecessary but money seem to fly away simply we do not manage well somehow " " oh it ’ all right " he say with a little cough look at she from under his brow that cough she know well it be a sign of intense dissatisfaction not with she but with himself he certainly be displeased not at so much money be spend but at be remind of what he know something be unsatisfactory want to forget " I have tell sokolov to sell the wheat and to borrow an advance on the mill we shall have money enough in any case " " yes but I ’m afraid that altogether " " oh it ’ all right all right " he repeat " well goodbye darling " " no I ’m really sorry sometimes that I listen to mamma how nice it would have be in the country as it be I ’m worry you all and we ’re waste our money " " not at all not at all not once since I ’ve be marry have I say that thing could have be well than they be " " truly " she say look into his eye he have say it without think simply to console she but when he glance at she and see those sweet truthful eye fasten questioningly on he he repeat it with his whole heart " I be positively forget she " he think and he remember what be before they so soon to come " will it be soon how do you feel " he whisper take her two hand " I have so often think so that now I do not think about it or know anything about it " " and you ’re not frightened " she smile contemptuously " not the least little bit " she say " well if anything happen I shall be at katavasov ’s " " no nothing will happen and do not think about it I ’m go for a walk on the boulevard with papa we ’re go to see dolly I shall expect you before dinner oh yes do you know that dolly ’s position be become utterly impossible she ’ in debt all round she have not a penny we be talk yesterday with mamma and arseny " this be her sister ’s husband lvov " and we determine to send you with he to talk to stiva it ’ really unbearable one can not speak to papa about it but if you and he " " why what can we do " say levin " you ’ll be at arseny ’s anyway talk to he he will tell what we decide " " oh I agree to everything arseny think beforehand I ’ll go and see he by the way if I do go to the concert I ’ll go with natalia well goodbye " on the step levin be stop by his old servant kouzma who have be with he before his marriage and now look after their household in town " beauty " that be the left shafthorse bring up from the country " have be badly shod and be quite lame " he say " what do your honor wish to be do " during the first part of their stay in moscow levin have use his own horse bring up from the country he have try to arrange this part of their expense in the good and cheap way possible but it appear that their own horse come dear than hire horse and they still hire too " send for the veterinary there may be a bruise " " and for katerina alexandrovna " ask kouzma levin be not by now strike as he have be at first by the fact that to get from one end of moscow to the other he have to have two powerful horse put into a heavy carriage to take the carriage three mile through the snowy slush and to keep it stand there four hour pay five rouble every time now it seem quite natural " hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster " say he " yes sir " and so simply and easily thank to the facility of town life levin settle a question which in the country would have call for so much personal trouble and exertion and go out onto the step he call a sledge sit down and drive to nikitsky on the way he think no more of money but muse on the introduction that await he to the petersburg savant a writer on sociology and what he would say to he about his book only during the first day of his stay in moscow levin have be strike by the expenditure strange to one live in the country unproductive but inevitable that be expect of he on every side but by now he have grow used to it that have happen to he in this matter which be say to happen to drunkard — the first glass stick in the throat the second fly down like a hawk but after the third they ’re like tiny little bird when levin have change his first hundredrouble note to pay for livery for his footman and hallporter he could not help reflect that these livery be of no use to anyone — but they be indubitably necessary to judge by the amazement of the princess and kitty when he suggest that they might do without livery — that these livery would cost the wage of two laborer for the summer that is would pay for about three hundred working day from easter to ash wednesday and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening — and that hundredrouble note do stick in his throat but the next note change to pay for provide a dinner for their relation that cost twentyeight rouble though it do excite in levin the reflection that twentyeight rouble mean nine measure of oats which man would with groan and sweat have reap and bind and thrash and winnow and sift and sow — this next one he part with more easily and now the note he change no long arouse such reflection and they fly off like little bird whether the labor devote to obtain the money correspond to the pleasure give by what be buy with it be a consideration he have long ago dismiss his business calculation that there be a certain price below which he could not sell certain grain be forget too the rye for the price of which he have so long hold out have be sell for fifty kopeck a measure cheap than it have be fetch a month ago even the consideration that with such an expenditure he could not go on live for a year without debt that even have no force only one thing be essential to have money in the bank without inquire where it come from so as to know that one have the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow and this condition have hitherto be fulfil he have always have the money in the bank but now the money in the bank have go and he could not quite tell where to get the next installment and this it be which at the moment when kitty have mention money have disturb he but he have no time to think about it he drive off think of katavasov and the meeting with metrov that be before he levin have on this visit to town see a great deal of his old friend at the university professor katavasov whom he have not see since his marriage he like in katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life levin think that the clearness of katavasov ’s conception of life be due to the poverty of his nature katavasov think that the disconnectedness of levin ’s idea be due to his lack of intellectual discipline but levin enjoy katavasov ’s clearness and katavasov enjoy the abundance of levin ’s untrained idea and they like to meet and to discuss levin have read katavasov some part of his book and he have like they on the previous day katavasov have meet levin at a public lecture and tell he that the celebrated metrov whose article levin have so much like be in moscow that he have be much interested by what katavasov have tell he about levin ’s work and that he be come to see he tomorrow at eleven and would be very glad to make levin ’s acquaintance " you ’re positively a reformed character I ’m glad to see " say katavasov meet levin in the little drawingroom " I hear the bell and think impossible that it can be he at the exact time well what do you say to the montenegrins now they ’re a race of warrior " " why what ’ happen " ask levin katavasov in a few word tell he the last piece of news from the war and go into his study introduce levin to a short thickset man of pleasant appearance this be metrov the conversation touch for a brief space on politic and on how recent event be look at in the high sphere in petersburg metrov repeat a saying that have reach he through a most trustworthy source report as have be utter on this subject by the tsar and one of the minister katavasov have hear also on excellent authority that the tsar have say something quite different levin try to imagine circumstance in which both saying might have be utter and the conversation on that topic drop " yes here he ’ write almost a book on the natural condition of the laborer in relation to the land " say katavasov " I ’m not a specialist but I as a natural science man be pleased at his not take mankind as something outside biological law but on the contrary see his dependence on his surrounding and in that dependence seek the law of his development " " that ’ very interesting " say metrov " what I begin precisely be to write a book on agriculture but study the chief instrument of agriculture the laborer " say levin reddening " I could not help come to quite unexpected result " and levin begin carefully as it be feel his ground to expound his view he know metrov have write an article against the generally accept theory of political economy but to what extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new view he do not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man " but in what do you see the special characteristic of the russian laborer " say metrov " in his biological characteristic so to speak or in the condition in which he be place " levin see that there be an idea underlie this question with which he do not agree but he go on explain his own idea that the russian laborer have a quite special view of the land different from that of other people and to support this proposition he make haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the russian peasant be due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanse in the east " one may easily be lead into error in base any conclusion on the general vocation of a people " say metrov interrupt levin " the condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital " and without let levin finish explain his idea metrov begin expound to he the special point of his own theory in what the point of his theory lie levin do not understand because he do not take the trouble to understand he see that metrov like other people in spite of his own article in which he have attack the current theory of political economy look at the position of the russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital wage and rent he would indeed have be oblige to admit that in the eastern — much the large — part of russia rent be as yet nil that for ninetenth of the eighty million of the russian peasant wage take the form simply of food provide for themselves and that capital do not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tool yet it be only from that point of view that he consider every laborer though in many point he differ from the economist and have his own theory of the wagefund which he expound to levin levin listen reluctantly and at first make objection he would have like to interrupt metrov to explain his own thought which in his opinion would have render further exposition of metrov ’s theory superfluous but later on feel convinced that they look at the matter so differently that they could never understand one another he do not even oppose his statement but simply listen although what metrov be say be by now utterly devoid of interest for he he yet experience a certain satisfaction in listen to he it flatter his vanity that such a learned man should explain his idea to he so eagerly with such intensity and confidence in levin ’s understanding of the subject sometimes with a mere hint refer he to a whole aspect of the subject he put this down to his own credit unaware that metrov who have already discuss his theory over and over again with all his intimate friend talk of it with special eagerness to every new person and in general be eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interest he even if still obscure to himself " we be late though " say katavasov look at his watch directly metrov have finish his discourse " yes there ’ a meeting of the society of amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of svintitch " say katavasov in answer to levin ’s inquiry " pyotr ivanovitch and I be go I ’ve promise to deliver an address on his labor in zoology come along with we it ’ very interesting " " yes and indeed it ’ time to start " say metrov " come with we and from there if you care to come to my place I should very much like to hear your work " " oh no it ’ no good yet it ’ unfinished but I shall be very glad to go to the meeting " " I say friend have you hear he have hand in the separate report " katavasov call from the other room where he be put on his frock coat and a conversation spring up upon the university question which be a very important event that winter in moscow three old professor in the council have not accept the opinion of the young professor the young one have register a separate resolution this in the judgment of some people be monstrous in the judgment of other it be the simple and most just thing to do and the professor be split up into two party one party to which katavasov belong see in the opposite party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery while the opposite party see in they childishness and lack of respect for the authority levin though he do not belong to the university have several time already during his stay in moscow hear and talk about this matter and have his own opinion on the subject he take part in the conversation that be continue in the street as you all three walk to the building of the old university the meeting have already begin round the clothcovered table at which katavasov and metrov seat themselves there be some halfdozen person and one of these be bend close over a manuscript read something aloud levin sit down in one of the empty chair that be stand round the table and in a whisper ask a student sit near what be be read the student eye levin with displeasure say " biography " though levin be not interested in the biography he could not help listen and learn some new and interesting fact about the life of the distinguished man of science when the reader have finish the chairman thank he and read some verse of the poet ment send he on the jubilee and say a few word by way of thank to the poet then katavasov in his loud ring voice read his address on the scientific labor of the man whose jubilee be be keep when katavasov have finish levin look at his watch see it be past one and think that there would not be time before the concert to read metrov his book and indeed he do not now care to do so during the reading he have think over their conversation he see distinctly now that though metrov ’s idea might perhaps have value his own idea have a value too and their idea could only be make clear and lead to something if each work separately in his choose path and that nothing would be gain by put their idea together and have make up his mind to refuse metrov ’s invitation levin go up to he at the end of the meeting metrov introduce levin to the chairman with whom he be talk of the political news metrov tell the chairman what he have already tell levin and levin make the same remark on his news that he have already make that morning but for the sake of variety he express also a new opinion which have only just strike he after that the conversation turn again on the university question as levin have already hear it all he make haste to tell metrov that he be sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation take leave and drive to lvov ’s lvov the husband of natalia kitty ’s sister have spend all his life in foreign capital where he have be educate and have be in the diplomatic service during the previous year he have leave the diplomatic service not owe to any " unpleasantness " he never have any " unpleasantness " with anyone and be transfer to the department of the court of the palace in moscow in order to give his two boy the good education possible in spite of the striking contrast in their habit and view and the fact that lvov be old than levin they have see a great deal of one another that winter and have take a great liking to each other lvov be at home and levin go in to he unannounced lvov in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoe be sit in an armchair and with a pincenez with blue glass he be read a book that stand on a reading desk while in his beautiful hand he hold a halfburned cigarette daintily away from he his handsome delicate and still youthfullooking face to which his curly glisten silvery hair give a still more aristocratic air light up with a smile when he see levin " capital I be mean to send to you how ’ kitty sit here it ’ more comfortable " he get up and push up a rocking chair " have you read the last circular in the journal de st pétersbourg I think it ’ excellent " he say with a slight french accent levin tell he what he have hear from katavasov be be say in petersburg and after talk a little about politic he tell he of his interview with metrov and the learned society ’s meeting to lvov it be very interesting " that ’ what I envy you that you be able to mix in these interesting scientific circle " he say and as he talk he pass as usual into french which be easy to he " it ’ true I have not the time for it my official work and the child leave I no time and then I ’m not ashamed to own that my education have be too defective " " that I do not believe " say levin with a smile feeling as he always do touch at lvov ’s low opinion of himself which be not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest but be absolutely sincere " oh yes indeed I feel now how badly educated I be to educate my child I positively have to look up a great deal and in fact simply to study myself for it ’ not enough to have teacher there must be someone to look after they just as on your land you want laborer and an overseer see what I ’m reading”—he point to buslaev ’s grammar on the desk—“it ’ expect of misha and it ’ so difficult come explain to I here he say " levin try to explain to he that it could not be understand but that it have to be teach but lvov would not agree with he " oh you ’re laugh at it " " on the contrary you can not imagine how when I look at you I ’m always learn the task that lie before I that be the education of one ’s child " " well there ’ nothing for you to learn " say lvov " all I know " say levin " be that I have never see well broughtup child than yours and I would not wish for child well than your " lvov visibly try to restrain the expression of his delight but he be positively radiant with smile " if only they ’re well than I that ’ all I desire you do not know you all the work " he say " with boy who ’ve be leave like mine to run wild abroad " " you ’ll catch all that up they ’re such clever child the great thing be the education of character that ’ what I learn when I look at your child " " you talk of the education of character you can not imagine how difficult that be you have hardly succeed in combat one tendency when other crop up and the struggle begin again if one have not a support in religion — you remember we talk about that — no father could bring child up rely on his own strength alone without that help " this subject which always interest levin be cut short by the entrance of the beauty natalia alexandrovna dress to go out " I do not know you be here " she say unmistakably feel no regret but a positive pleasure in interrupt this conversation on a topic she have hear so much of that she be by now weary of it " well how be kitty I be dine with you today I tell you what arseny " she turn to her husband " you take the carriage " and the husband and wife begin to discuss their arrangement for the day as the husband have to drive to meet someone on official business while the wife have to go to the concert and some public meeting of a committee on the eastern question there be a great deal to consider and settle levin have to take part in their plan as one of themselves it be settle that levin should go with natalia to the concert and the meeting and that from there they should send the carriage to the office for arseny and he should call for she and take she to kitty ’s or that if he have not finish his work he should send the carriage back and levin would go with she " he ’ spoil I " lvov say to his wife " he assure I that our child be splendid when I know how much that ’ bad there be in they " " arseny go to extreme I always say " say his wife " if you look for perfection you will never be satisfied and it ’ true as papa say — that when we be bring up there be one extreme — we be keep in the basement while our parent live in the good room now it ’ just the other way — the parent be in the wash house while the child be in the good room parent now be not expect to live at all but to exist altogether for their child " " well what if they like it well " lvov say with his beautiful smile touch her hand " anyone who do not know you would think you be a stepmother not a true mother " " no extreme be not good in anything " natalia say serenely put his paperknife straight in its proper place on the table " well come here you perfect child " lvov say to the two handsome boy who come in and after bow to levin go up to their father obviously wish to ask he about something levin would have like to talk to they to hear what they would say to their father but natalia begin talk to he and then lvov ’s colleague in the service mahotin walk in wear his court uniform to go with he to meet someone and a conversation be keep up without a break upon herzegovina princess korzinskaya the town council and the sudden death of madame apraksina levin even forget the commission intrust to he he recollect it as he be go into the hall " oh kitty tell I to talk to you about oblonsky " he say as lvov be stand on the stair see his wife and levin off " yes yes maman want we les beauxfrères to attack he " he say blush " but why should I " " well then I will attack he " say madame lvova with a smile stand in her white sheepskin cape wait till they have finish speak " come let we go " at the concert in the afternoon two very interesting thing be perform one be a fantasia king lear the other be a quartette dedicate to the memory of bach both be new and in the new style and levin be eager to form an opinion of they after escort his sisterinlaw to her stall he stand against a column and try to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible he try not to let his attention be distract and not to spoil his impression by look at the conductor in a white tie wave his arm which always disturb his enjoyment of music so much or the lady in bonnet with string carefully tie over their ear and all these people either think of nothing at all or think of all sort of thing except the music he try to avoid meet musical connoisseur or talkative acquaintance and stand look at the floor straight before he listen but the more he listen to the fantasia of king lear the far he feel from form any definite opinion of it there be as it be a continual beginning a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling but it fall to piece again directly break into new musical motive or simply nothing but the whim of the composer exceedingly complex but disconnected sound and these fragmentary musical expression though sometimes beautiful be disagreeable because they be utterly unexpected and not lead up to by anything gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph follow one another without any connection like the emotion of a madman and those emotion like a madman ’s spring up quite unexpectedly during the whole of the performance levin feel like a deaf man watch people dance and be in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia be over and feel a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his attention loud applause resound on all side everyone get up move about and begin talk anxious to throw some light on his own perplexity from the impression of other levin begin to walk about look for connoisseur and be glad to see a wellknown musical amateur in conversation with pestsov whom he know " marvelous " pestsov be say in his mellow bass " how be you konstantin dmitrievitch particularly sculpturesque and plastic so to say and richly colored be that passage where you feel cordelia ’s approach where woman das ewig weibliche enter into conflict with fate be not it " " you mean   what have cordelia to do with it " levin ask timidly forget that the fantasia be suppose to represent king lear " cordelia come in   see here " say pestsov tap his finger on the satiny surface of the program he hold in his hand and pass it to levin only then levin recollect the title of the fantasia and make haste to read in the russian translation the line from shakespeare that be print on the back of the program " you can not follow it without that " say pestsov address levin as the person he have be speak to have go away and he have no one to talk to in the entr’acte levin and pestsov fall into an argument upon the merit and defect of music of the wagner school levin maintain that the mistake of wagner and all his follower lie in their try to take music into the sphere of another art just as poetry go wrong when it try to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do and as an instance of this mistake he cite the sculptor who carve in marble certain poetic phantasm flit round the figure of the poet on the pedestal " these phantom be so far from be phantom that they be positively cling on the ladder " say levin the comparison please he but he could not remember whether he have not use the same phrase before and to pestsov too and as he say it he feel confused pestsov maintain that art be one and that it can attain its high manifestation only by conjunction with all kind of art the second piece that be perform levin could not hear pestsov who be stand beside he be talk to he almost all the time condemn the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity and compare it with the simplicity of the preraphaelite in painting as he go out levin meet many more acquaintance with whom he talk of politic of music and of common acquaintance among other he meet count bol whom he have utterly forget to call upon " well go at once then " madame lvova say when he tell she " perhaps they ’ll not be at home and then you can come to the meeting to fetch I you ’ll find I still there " " perhaps they ’re not at home " say levin as he go into the hall of countess bola ’s house " at home please walk in " say the porter resolutely remove his overcoat " how annoying " think levin with a sigh take off one glove and stroke his hat " what do I come for what have I to say to they " as he pass through the first drawingroom levin meet in the doorway countess bola give some order to a servant with a careworn and severe face on see levin she smile and ask he to come into the little drawingroom where he hear voice in this room there be sit in armchair the two daughter of the countess and a moscow colonel whom levin know levin go up greet they and sit down beside the sofa with his hat on his knee " how be your wife have you be at the concert we could not go mamma have to be at the funeral service " " yes I hear what a sudden death " say levin the countess come in sit down on the sofa and she too ask after his wife and inquire about the concert levin answer and repeat an inquiry about madame apraksina ’s sudden death " but she be always in weak health " " be you at the opera yesterday " " yes I be " " lucca be very good " " yes very good " he say and as it be utterly of no consequence to he what they think of he he begin repeat what they have hear a hundred time about the characteristic of the singer ’s talent countess bola pretend to be listen then when he have say enough and pause the colonel who have be silent till then begin to talk the colonel too talk of the opera and about culture at last after speak of the propose folle journée at turin ’s the colonel laugh get up noisily and go away levin too rise but he see by the face of the countess that it be not yet time for he to go he must stay two minute long he sit down but as he be think all the while how stupid it be he could not find a subject for conversation and sit silent " you be not go to the public meeting they say it will be very interesting " begin the countess " no I promise my bellesœur to fetch she from it " say levin a silence follow the mother once more exchange glance with a daughter " well now I think the time have come " think levin and he get up the lady shake hand with he and beg he to say mille choses to his wife for they the porter ask he as he give he his coat " where be your honor stay " and immediately write down his address in a big handsomely bind book " of course I do not care but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid " think levin console himself with the reflection that everyone do it he drive to the public meeting where he be to find his sisterinlaw so as to drive home with she at the public meeting of the committee there be a great many people and almost all the high society levin be in time for the report which as everyone say be very interesting when the reading of the report be over people move about and levin meet sviazhsky who invite he very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the society of agriculture where a celebrated lecture be to be deliver and stepan arkadyevitch who have only just come from the race and many other acquaintance and levin hear and utter various criticism on the meeting on the new fantasia and on a public trial but probably from the mental fatigue he be begin to feel he make a blunder in speak of the trial and this blunder he recall several time with vexation speak of the sentence upon a foreigner who have be condemn in russia and of how unfair it would be to punish he by exile abroad levin repeat what he have hear the day before in conversation from an acquaintance " I think send he abroad be much the same as punish a carp by put it into the water " say levin then he recollect that this idea which he have hear from an acquaintance and utter as his own come from a fable of krilov ’s and that the acquaintance have pick it up from a newspaper article after drive home with his sisterinlaw and find kitty in good spirit and quite well levin drive to the club levin reach the club just at the right time member and visitor be drive up as he arrive levin have not be at the club for a very long while — not since he live in moscow when he be leave the university and go into society

of the sledge he mount the step and the hallporter adorn with a crossway scarf noiselessly open the door to he with a bow as soon as he see in the porter ’s room the cloak and galosh of member who

porter at the top door a familiar figure grow old in the club livery open the door without haste or delay and scan the visitor as they pass in — levin feel the old impression of the club come back in a rush an impression of repose comfort and propriety " your hat please " the porter say to levin who forget the club rule to leave his hat in the porter ’s room " long time since you ’ve be the prince

the carriage be drive out of the clubhouse gate that levin be still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose comfort and unimpeachable good form but as soon as the carriage drive out into the street and he feel it jolt over the uneven road hear the angry shout of a sledge driver come towards they see in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the shop this impression be

even she have leave she consider this a breach of propriety well you see in such a position any other woman would not have find resource in herself but you ’ll see how she have arrange her life — how calm how dignified she be to the left in the crescent opposite the church " shout stepan arkadyevitch lean out of the window " phew how hot it be " he say in spite of twelve degree of frost fling his open overcoat still wider open " but she have a daughter no doubt she ’ busy look after she " say levin " I believe you picture every woman simply as a female une couveuse " say stepan arkadyevitch " if she ’ occupied it must be with her child no she bring she up capitally I believe but one do not hear about she she ’ busy in the first place with what she write I see you ’re smile ironically but you ’re wrong she ’ write a child ’s book and do not talk about it to anyone but she read it to I and I give the manuscript to vorkuev   you know the publisher   and he ’ an author himself too I fancy he understand those thing and he say it ’ a remarkable piece of work but be you fancy she ’ an authoress — not a bit of it she ’ a woman with a heart before everything but you ’ll see now she have a little english girl with she and a whole family she ’ look after " " oh something in a philanthropic way " " why you will look at everything in the bad light it ’ not from philanthropy it ’ from the heart they — that is vronsky — have a trainer an englishman firstrate in his own line but a drunkard he ’ completely give up to drink — delirium tremens — and the family be cast on the world she see they help they get more and more interested in they and now the whole family be on her hand but not by way of patronage you know help with money she ’ herself prepare the boy in russian for the high school and she ’ take the little girl to live with she but you ’ll see she for yourself " the carriage drive into the courtyard and stepan arkadyevitch ring loudly at the entrance where sledge be stand and without ask the servant who open the door whether the lady be at home stepan arkadyevitch walk into the hall levin follow he more and more doubtful whether he be do right or wrong look at himself in the glass levin notice that he be red in the face but he feel certain he be not drunk and he follow stepan arkadyevitch up the carpeted stair at the top stepan arkadyevitch inquire of the footman who bow to he as to an intimate friend who be with anna arkadyevna and receive the answer that it be m vorkuev " where be they " " in the study " pass through the diningroom a room not very large with dark paneled wall stepan arkadyevitch and levin walk over the soft carpet to the halfdark study light up by a single lamp with a big dark shade another lamp with a reflector be hang on the wall light up a big fulllength portrait of a woman which levin could not help look at it be the portrait of anna paint in italy by mihailov while stepan arkadyevitch go behind the treillage and the man ’s voice which have be speak pause levin gaze at the portrait which stand out from the frame in the brilliant light throw on it and he could not tear himself away from it he positively forget where he be and not even hear what be say he could not take his eye off the marvelous portrait it be not a picture but a live charming woman with black curl hair with bare arm and shoulder with a pensive smile on the lip cover with soft down triumphantly and softly she look at he with eye that baffle he she be not live only because she be more beautiful than a live woman can be " I be delighted " he hear suddenly near he a voice unmistakably address he the voice of the very woman he have be admire in the portrait anna have come from behind the treillage to meet he and levin see in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait in a dark blue shot gown not in the same position nor with the same expression but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist have catch in the portrait she be less dazzling in reality but on the other hand there be something fresh and seductive in the live woman which be not in the portrait she have rise to meet he not conceal her pleasure at see he and in the quiet ease with which she hold out her little vigorous hand introduce he to vorkuev and indicate a redhaired pretty little girl who be sit at work call she her pupil levin recognize and like the manner of a woman of the great world always selfpossessed and natural " I be delighted delighted " she repeat and on her lip these simple word take for levin ’s ear a special significance " I have know you and like you for a long while both from your friendship with stiva and for your wife ’s sake I know she for a very short time but she leave on I the impression of an exquisite flower simply a flower and to think she will soon be a mother " she speak easily and without haste look now and then from levin to her brother and levin feel that the impression he be make be good and he feel immediately at home simple and happy with she as though he have know she from childhood " ivan petrovitch and I settle in alexey ’s study " she say in answer to stepan arkadyevitch ’s question whether he might smoke " just so as to be able to smoke”—and glance at levin instead of ask whether he would smoke she pull close a tortoiseshell cigarcase and take a cigarette " how be you feel today " her brother ask she " oh nothing nerve as usual " " yes be not it extraordinarily fine " say stepan arkadyevitch notice that levin be scrutinize the picture " I have never see a well portrait " " and extraordinarily like be not it " say vorkuev levin look from the portrait to the original a peculiar brilliance light up anna ’s face when she feel his eye on she levin flush and to cover his confusion would have ask whether she have see darya alexandrovna lately but at that moment anna speak " we be just talk ivan petrovitch and I of vashtchenkov ’s last picture have you see they " " yes I have see they " answer levin " but I beg your pardon I interrupt you   you be say " levin ask if she have see dolly lately " she be here yesterday she be very indignant with the high school people on grisha ’s account the latin teacher it seem have be unfair to he " " yes I have see his picture I do not care for they very much " levin go back to the subject she have start levin talk now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to the subject with which he have be talk all the morning every word in his conversation with she have a special significance and talk to she be pleasant still pleasant it be to listen to she anna talk not merely naturally and cleverly but cleverly and carelessly attach no value to her own idea and give great weight to the idea of the person she be talk to the conversation turn on the new movement in art on the new illustration of the bible by a french artist vorkuev attack the artist for a realism carry to the point of coarseness levin say that the french have carry conventionality far than anyone and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to realism in the fact of not lie they see poetry never have anything clever say by levin give he so much pleasure as this remark anna ’s face light up at once as at once she appreciate the thought she laugh " I laugh " she say " as one laugh when one see a very true portrait what you say so perfectly hit off french art now painting and literature too indeed — zola daudet but perhaps it be always so that man form their conception from fictitious conventional type and then — all the combinaison make — they be tired of the fictitious figure and begin to invent more natural true figure " " that ’ perfectly true " say vorknev " so you ’ve be at the club " she say to her brother " yes yes this be a woman " levin think forget himself and stare persistently at her lovely mobile face which at that moment be all at once completely transform levin do not hear what she be talk of as she lean over to her brother but he be strike by the change of her expression her face — so handsome a moment before in its repose — suddenly wear a look of strange curiosity anger and pride but this last only an instant she drop her eyelid as though recollect something " oh well but that ’ of no interest to anyone " she say and she turn to the english girl " please order the tea in the drawingroom " she say in english the girl get up and go out " well how do she get through her examination " ask stepan arkadyevitch " splendidly she ’ a very gifted child and a sweet character " " it will end in your love she more than your own " " there a man speak in love there ’ no more nor less I love my daughter with one love and she with another " " I be just tell anna arkadyevna " say vorkuev " that if she be to put a hundredth part of the energy she devote to this english girl to the public question of the education of russian child she would be do a great and useful work " " yes but I can not help it I could not do it count alexey kirillovitch urge I very much " as she utter the word count alexey kirillovitch she glance with appealing timidity at levin and he unconsciously respond with a respectful and reassuring look " he urge I to take up the school in the village I visit it several time the child be very nice but I could not feel draw to the work you speak of energy energy rest upon love and come as it will there ’ no forcing it I take to this child — I could not myself say why " and she glance again at levin and her smile and her glance — all tell he that it be to he only she be address her word value his good opinion and at the same time sure beforehand that they understand each other " I quite understand that " levin answer " it ’ impossible to give one ’s heart to a school or such institution in general and I believe that ’ just why philanthropic institution always give such poor result " she be silent for a while then she smile " yes yes " she agree " I never could je n’ai pas le cœur assez large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girl cela ne m’a jamais réussi there be so many woman who have make themselves une position sociale in that way and now more than ever " she say with a mournful confiding expression ostensibly address her brother but unmistakably intend her word only for levin " now when I have such need of some occupation I can not " and suddenly frown levin see that she be frown at herself for talk about herself she change the subject " I know about you " she say to levin " that you ’re not a publicspirited citizen and I have defend you to the good of my ability " " how have you defend I " " oh accord to the attack make on you but will not you have some tea " she rise and take up a book bind in morocco " give it to I anna arkadyevna " say vorkuev indicate the book " it ’ well worth take up " " oh no it ’ all so sketchy " " I tell he about it " stepan arkadyevitch say to his sister nod at levin " you should not have my writing be something after the fashion of those little basket and carving which liza mertsalova use to sell I from the prison she have the direction of the prison department in that society " she turn to levin " and they be miracle of patience the work of those poor wretch " and levin see a new trait in this woman who attract he so extraordinarily besides wit grace and beauty she have truth she have no wish to hide from he all the bitterness of her position as she say that she sigh and her face suddenly take a hard expression look as it be turn to stone with that expression on her face she be more beautiful than ever but the expression be new it be utterly unlike that expression radiant with happiness and create happiness which have be catch by the painter in her portrait levin look more than once at the portrait and at her figure as take her brother ’s arm she walk with he to the high door and he feel for she a tenderness and pity at which he wonder himself she ask levin and vorkuev to go into the drawingroom while she stay behind to say a few word to her brother " about her divorce about vronsky and what he ’ do at the club about I " wonder levin and he be so keenly interested by the question of what she be say to stepan arkadyevitch that he scarcely hear what vorkuev be tell he of the quality of the story for child anna arkadyevna have write at tea the same pleasant sort of talk full of interesting matter continue there be not a single instant when a subject for conversation be to seek on the contrary it be feel that one have hardly time to say what one have to say and eagerly hold back to hear what the other be say and all that be say not only by she but by vorkuev and stepan arkadyevitch — all so it seem to levin gain peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism while he follow this interesting conversation levin be all the time admire she — her beauty her intelligence her culture and at the same time her directness and genuine depth of feeling he listen and talk and all the while he be think of her inner life try to divine her feeling and though he have judge she so severely hitherto now by some strange chain of reasoning he be justify she and be also sorry for she and afraid that vronsky do not fully understand she at eleven o’clock when stepan arkadyevitch get up to go vorkuev have leave early it seem to levin that he have only just come regretfully levin too rise " goodbye " she say hold his hand and glance into his face with a winning look " I be very glad que la glace est rompue " she drop his hand and half close her eye " tell your wife that I love she as before and that if she can not pardon I my position then my wish for she be that she may never pardon it to pardon it one must go through what I have go through and may god spare she that " " certainly yes I will tell she " levin say blush " what a marvelous sweet and unhappy woman " he be think as he step out into the frosty air with stepan arkadyevitch " well do not I tell you " say stepan arkadyevitch see that levin have be completely win over " yes " say levin dreamily " an extraordinary woman it ’ not her cleverness but she have such wonderful depth of feeling I ’m awfully sorry for she " " now please god everything will soon be settle well well do not be hard on people in future " say stepan arkadyevitch open the carriage door " goodbye we do not go the same way " still think of anna of everything even the simple phrase in their conversation with she and recall the minute change in her expression enter more and more into her position and feel sympathy for she levin reach home at home kouzma tell levin that katerina alexandrovna be quite well and that her sister have not long be go and he hand he two letter levin read they at once in the hall that he might not overlook they later one be from sokolov his bailiff sokolov write that the corn could not be sell that it be fetch only five and a half rouble and that more than that could not be get for it the other letter be from his sister she scold he for her business be still unsettled " well we must sell it at five and a half if we can not get more " levin decide the first question which have always before seem such a weighty one with extraordinary facility on the spot " it ’ extraordinary how all one ’s time be take up here " he think consider the second letter he feel himself to blame for not have get do what his sister have ask he to do for she " today again I ’ve not be to the court but today I ’ve certainly not have time " and resolve that he would not fail to do it next day he go up to his wife as he go in levin rapidly run through mentally the day he have spend all the event of the day be conversation conversation he have hear and take part in all the conversation be upon subject which if he have be alone at home he would never have take up but here they be very interesting and all these conversation be right enough only in two place there be something not quite right one be what he have say about the carp the other be something not " quite the thing " in the tender sympathy he be feel for anna levin find his wife lowspirited and dull the dinner of the three sister have go off very well but then they have wait and wait for he all of they have feel dull the sister have depart and she have be leave alone " well and what have you be do " she ask he look straight into his eye which shine with rather a suspicious brightness but that she might not prevent his tell she everything she conceal her close scrutiny of he and with an approving smile listen to his account of how he have spend the evening " well I ’m very glad I meet vronsky I feel quite at ease and natural with he you understand I shall try not to see he but I ’m glad that this awkwardness be all over " he say and remember that by way of try not to see he he have immediately go to call on anna he blush " we talk about the peasant drinking I do not know which drink most the peasantry or our own class the peasant do on holiday but " but kitty take not the slight interest in discuss the drinking habit of the peasant she see that he blush and she want to know why " well and then where do you go " " stiva urge I awfully to go and see anna arkadyevna " and as he say this levin blush even more and his doubt as to whether he have do right in go to see anna be settle once for all he know now that he ought not to have do so kitty ’s eye open in a curious way and gleam at anna ’s name but control herself with an effort she conceal her emotion and deceive he " oh " be all she say " I ’m sure you will not be angry at my go stiva beg I to and dolly wish it " levin go on " oh no " she say but he see in her eye a constraint that bode he no good " she be a very sweet very very unhappy good woman " he say tell she about anna her occupation and what she have tell he to say to she " yes of course she be very much to be pity " say kitty when he have finish " whom be your letter from " he tell she and believe in her calm tone he go to change his coat come back he find kitty in the same easy chair when he go up to she she glance at he and break into sob " what what be it " he ask know beforehand what " you ’re in love with that hateful woman she have bewitch you I see it in your eye yes yes what can it all lead to you be drink at the club drink and gamble and then you go   to she of all people no we must go away I shall go away tomorrow " it be a long while before levin could soothe his wife at last he succeed in calm she only by confess that a feeling of pity in conjunction with the wine he have drink have be too much for he that he have succumb to anna ’s artful influence and that he would avoid she one thing he do with more sincerity confess to be that live so long in moscow a life of nothing but conversation eating and drinking he be degenerate they talk till three o’clock in the morning only at three o’clock be they sufficiently reconcile to be able to go to sleep after take leave of her guest anna do not sit down but begin walk up and down the room she have unconsciously the whole evening do her utmost to arouse in levin a feeling of love — as of late she have fall into do with all young man — and she know she have attain her aim as far as be possible in one evening with a married and conscientious man she like he indeed extremely and in spite of the strike difference from the masculine point of view between vronsky and levin as a woman she see something they have in common which have make kitty able to love both yet as soon as he be out of the room she cease to think of he one think and one only pursue she in different form and refuse to be shake off " if I have so much effect on other on this man who love his home and his wife why be it he be so cold to I not cold exactly he love I I know that but something new be draw we apart now why be not he here all the evening he tell stiva to say he could not leave yashvin and must watch over his play be yashvin a child but suppose it ’ true he never tell a lie but there ’ something else in it if it ’ true he be glad of an opportunity of show I that he have other duty I know that I submit to that but why prove that to I he want to show I that his love for I be not to interfere with his freedom but I need no proof I need love he ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for I here in moscow be this life I be not live but wait for an event which be continually put off and put off no answer again and stiva say he can not go to alexey alexandrovitch and I can not write again I can do nothing can begin nothing can alter nothing I hold myself in I wait invent amusement for myself — the english family writing reading — but it ’ all nothing but a sham it ’ all the same as morphine he ought to feel for I " she say feel tear of selfpity come into her eye she hear vronsky ’s abrupt ring and hurriedly dry her tear — not only dry her tear but sit down by a lamp and open a book affect composure she want to show he that she be displeased that he have not come home as he have promise — displeased only and not on any account to let he see her distress and least of all her selfpity she might pity herself but he must not pity she she do not want strife she blame he for want to quarrel but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism " well you ’ve not be dull " he say eagerly and goodhumoredly go up to she " what a terrible passion it be — gamble " " no I ’ve not be dull I ’ve learn long ago not to be dull stiva have be here and levin " " yes they mean to come and see you well how do you like levin " he say sit down beside she " very much they have not long be go what be yashvin do " " he be win — seventeen thousand I get he away he have really start home but he go back again and now he ’ lose " " then what do you stay for " she ask suddenly lift her eye to he the expression of her face be cold and ungracious " you tell stiva you be stay on to get yashvin away and you have leave he there " the same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appear on his face too " in the first place I do not ask he to give you any message and secondly I never tell lie but what ’ the chief point I want to stay and I stay " he say frown " anna what be it for why will you " he say after a moment ’s silence bend over towards she and he open his hand hope she would lay hers in it she be glad of this appeal for tenderness but some strange force of evil would not let she give herself up to her feeling as though the rule of warfare would not permit she to surrender " of course you want to stay and you stay you do everything you want to but what do you tell I that for with what object " she say get more and more excited " do anyone contest your right but you want to be right and you ’re welcome to be right " his hand close he turn away and his face wear a still more obstinate expression " for you it ’ a matter of obstinacy " she say watch he intently and suddenly find the right word for that expression that irritate she " simply obstinacy for you it ’ a question of whether you keep the upper hand of I while for I " again she feel sorry for herself and she almost burst into tear " if you know what it be for I when I feel as I do now that you be hostile yes hostile to I if you know what this mean for I if you know how I feel on the brink of calamity at this instant how afraid I be of myself " and she turn away hide her sob " but what be you talk about " he say horrified at her expression of despair and again bend over she he take her hand and kiss it " what be it for do I seek amusement outside our home do not I avoid the society of woman " " well yes if that be all " she say " come tell I what I ought to do to give you peace of mind I be ready to do anything to make you happy " he say touch by her expression of despair " what would not I do to save you from distress of any sort as now anna " he say " it ’ nothing nothing " she say " I do not know myself whether it ’ the solitary life my nerve come do not let we talk of it what about the race you have not tell I " she inquire try to conceal her triumph at the victory which have anyway be on her side he ask for supper and begin tell she about the race but in his tone in his eye which become more and more cold she see that he do not forgive she for her victory that the feeling of obstinacy with which she have be struggle have assert itself again in he he be cold to she than before as though he be regret his surrender and she remember the word that have give she the victory " how I feel on the brink of calamity how afraid I be of myself " see that this weapon be a dangerous one and that it could not be use a second time and she feel that beside the love that bind they together there have grow up between they some evil spirit of strife which she could not exorcise from his and still less from her own heart there be no condition to which a man can not become use especially if he see that all around he be live in the same way levin could not have believe three month before that he could have go quietly to sleep in the condition in which he be that day that lead an aimless irrational life live too beyond his mean after drink to excess he could not call what happen at the club anything else form inappropriately friendly relation with a man with whom his wife have once be in love and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman who could only be call a lost woman after be fascinate by that woman and cause his wife distress — he could still go quietly to sleep but under the influence of fatigue a sleepless night and the wine he have drink his sleep be sound and untroubled at five o’clock the creak of a door opening wake he he jump up and look round kitty be not in bed beside he but there be a light move behind the screen and he hear her step " what be it what be it " he say halfasleep " kitty what be it " " nothing " she say come from behind the screen with a candle in her hand " I feel unwell " she say smile a particularly sweet and meaning smile " what have it begin " he say in terror " we ought to send " and hurriedly he reach after his clothe " no no " she say smile and hold his hand " it ’ sure to be nothing I be rather unwell only a little it ’ all over now " and get into bed she blow out the candle lie down and be still though he think her stillness suspicious as though she be hold her breath and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which as she come from behind the screen she say " nothing " he be so sleepy that he fall asleep at once only later he remember the stillness of her breathing and understand all that must have be pass in her sweet precious heart while she lie beside he not stir in anticipation of the great event in a woman ’s life at seven o’clock he be wake by the touch of her hand on his shoulder and a gentle whisper she seem struggle between regret at wake he and the desire to talk to he " kostya do not be frightened it ’ all right but I fancy we ought to send for lizaveta petrovna " the candle be light again she be sit up in bed hold some knitting which she have be busy upon during the last few day " please do not be frightened it ’ all right I ’m not a bit afraid " she say see his scared face and she press his hand to her bosom and then to her lip he hurriedly jump up hardly awake and keep his eye fix on she as he put on his dressing gown then he stop still look at she he have to go but he could not tear himself from her eye he think he love her face know her expression her eye but never have he see it like this how hateful and horrible he seem to himself think of the distress he have cause she yesterday her flushed face fringe with soft curl hair under her night cap be radiant with joy and courage though there be so little that be complex or artificial in kitty ’s character in general levin be strike by what be reveal now when you all disguise be throw off and the very kernel of her soul shine in her eye and in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul she the very woman he love in she be more manifest than ever she look at he smile but all at once her brow twitch she throw up her head and go quickly up to he clutch his hand and press close up to he breathe her hot breath upon he she be in pain and be as it be complain to he of her suffering and for the first minute from habit it seem to he that he be to blame but in her eye there be a tenderness that tell he that she be far from reproach he that she love he for her suffering " if not I who be to blame for it " he think unconsciously seek someone responsible for this suffering for he to punish but there be no one responsible she be suffer complain and triumph in her suffering and rejoice in they and love they he see that something sublime be be accomplish in her soul but what he could not make it out it be beyond his understanding " I have send to mamma you go quickly to fetch lizaveta petrovna   kostya nothing it ’ over " she move away from he and ring the bell " well go now pasha ’ come I be all right " and levin see with astonishment that she have take up the knitting she have bring in in the night and begin work at it again as levin be go out of one door he hear the maidservant come in at the other he stand at the door and hear kitty give exact direction to the maid and begin to help she move the bedstead he dress and while they be put in his horse as a hire sledge be not to be see yet he run again up to the bedroom not on tiptoe it seem to he but on wing two maidservant be carefully move something in the bedroom kitty be walk about knit rapidly and give direction " I ’m go for the doctor they have send for lizaveta petrovna but I ’ll go on there too be not there anything want yes shall I go to dolly ’s " she look at he obviously not hear what he be say " yes yes do go " she say quickly frown and wave her hand to he he have just go into the drawingroom when suddenly a plaintive moan sound from the bedroom smother instantly he stand still and for a long while he could not understand " yes that be she " he say to himself and clutch at his head he run downstairs " lord have mercy on we pardon we aid we " he repeat the word that for some reason come suddenly to his lip and he an unbeliever repeat these word not with his lip only at that instant he know that all his doubt even the impossibility of believe with his reason of which he be aware in himself do not in the least hinder his turning to god all of that now float out of his soul like dust to whom be he to turn if not to he in whose hand he feel himself his soul and his love the horse be not yet ready but feel a peculiar concentration of his physical force and his intellect on what he have to do he start off on foot without wait for the horse and tell kouzma to overtake he at the corner he meet a night cabman drive hurriedly in the little sledge wrap in a velvet cloak sit lizaveta petrovna with a kerchief round her head " thank god thank god " he say overjoyed to recognize her little fair face which wear a peculiarly serious even stern expression tell the driver not to stop he run along beside she " for two hour then not more " she inquire " you should let pyotr dmitrievitch know but do not hurry he and get some opium at the chemist ’s " " so you think that it may go on well lord have mercy on we and help we " levin say see his own horse drive out of the gate jump into the sledge beside kouzma he tell he to drive to the doctor ’s the doctor be not yet up and the footman say that " he have be up late and have give order not to be wake but would get up soon " the footman be clean the lampchimney and seem very busy about they this concentration of the footman upon his lamp and his indifference to what be pass in levin at first astound he but immediately on consider the question he realize that no one know or be bind to know his feeling and that it be all the more necessary to act calmly sensibly and resolutely to get through this wall of indifference and attain his aim " do not be in a hurry or let anything slip " levin say to himself feel a great and great flow of physical energy and attention to all that lie before he to do have ascertain that the doctor be not get up levin consider various plan and decide on the follow one that kouzma should go for another doctor while he himself should go to the chemist ’s for opium and if when he come back the doctor have not yet begin to get up he would either by tip the footman or by force wake the doctor at all hazard at the chemist ’s the lank shopman seal up a packet of powder for a coachman who stand wait and refuse he opium with the same callousness with which the doctor ’s footman have

hour three the full five hour he have fix as the furth limit of his suffering and the position be still unchanged and he be still bear it because there be nothing to be do but bear it every instant feeling that he have reach the utmost limit of his endurance and that his heart would break with sympathy and pain but still the minute pass by and the hour and still hour more and his misery and horror grow and be more and more intense all the ordinary condition of life without which one can form no conception of anything have cease to exist for levin he lose all sense of time minute — those minute when she send for he and he hold her moist hand that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence and then push it away — seem to he hour and hour seem to he minute he be surprised when lizaveta petrovna ask he to light a candle behind a screen and he find that it be five o’clock in the afternoon if he have be tell it be only ten o’clock in the morning he would not have be more surprised where he be all this time he know as little as the time of anything he see her swollen face sometimes bewildered and in agony sometimes smile and try to reassure he he see the old princess too flushed and overwrought with her gray curl in disorder force herself to gulp down her tear bite her lip he see dolly too and the doctor smoke fat cigarette and lizaveta petrovna with a firm

look compassionately at he beg he not to worry himself and dolly persuade he to eat something and lead he out of the room and even the doctor look seriously and with commiseration at he and offer he a drop of something all he know and feel be that what be happen be what have happen nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his brother nikolay but that have be grief — this be joy yet that grief and this joy be alike outside all the ordinary condition of life they be loophole as it be in that ordinary life through which there come glimpse of something sublime and in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul be exalt to inconceivable height of which it have before have no conception while reason lag behind unable to keep up with it " lord have mercy on we and succor we " he repeat to himself incessantly feel in spite of his long and as it seem complete alienation from religion that he turn to god just as trustfully and simply as he have in his

time he be bring back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reach he from the bedroom he fall into the same strange terror that have come upon he the first minute every time he hear a shriek he jump

there have be a period of repose and he have sink into oblivion he have completely forget what be go on now he hear the doctor ’s chat and understand it suddenly there come an unearthly shriek the shriek be so awful that levin do not even jump up but hold his breath gaze in terrified inquiry at the doctor the doctor put his head on one side listen and smile approvingly everything be so extraordinary that nothing could strike levin as strange " I suppose it must be so " he think and still sit where he be whose scream be this he jump up run on tiptoe to the bedroom edge round lizaveta petrovna and the princess and take up his position at kitty ’s pillow the scream have subside but there be some change now what it be he do not see and do not comprehend and he have no wish to see or comprehend but he see it by the face of lizaveta petrovna lizaveta petrovna ’s face be stern and pale and still as resolute though her jaw be twitch and her eye be fix intently on kitty kitty ’s swollen and agonized face a tress of hair cling to her moist brow be turn to he and seek his eye her lift hand ask for his hand clutch his chill hand in her moist one she begin squeeze they to her face " do n’t go do n’t go I ’m not afraid I ’m not afraid " she say rapidly " mamma take my earring they bother I you ’re not afraid quick quick lizaveta petrovna " she speak quickly very quickly and

the room " it ’ nothing it ’ nothing it ’ all right " dolly call after he but they might say what they like he know now that all be over he stand in the next room his head lean against the door post and hear shriek howl such as he have never hear before and he know that what have be kitty be utter these shriek he have long ago cease to wish for the child by now he loathe this child he do not even wish for her life now all he long for be the end of this awful anguish " doctor what be it what be it by god " he say snatch at the doctor ’s hand as he come up " it ’ the end " say the doctor and the doctor ’s face be so grave as he say it that levin take the end as mean her death beside himself he run into the bedroom the first thing he see be the face of lizaveta petrovna it be even more frowning and stern kitty ’s face he do not know in the place where it have be be something that be fearful in its strained distortion and in the sound that come from it he fall down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed feel that his heart be burst the awful scream never pause it become still more awful and as though it have reach the utmost limit of terror suddenly it cease levin could not believe his ear but there could be no doubt the scream have cease and he hear a subdued stir and bustle and hurried breathing and her voice gasp alive tender and blissful utter softly " it ’ over " he lift his head with her hand hang exhausted on the quilt look extraordinarily lovely and serene she look at he in silence and try to smile and could not and suddenly from the mysterious and awful faraway world in which he have be live for the last twentytwo hour levin feel himself all in an instant bear back to the old everyday world glorify though now by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it the strained chord snap sob and tear of joy which he have never foresee rise up with such violence that his whole body shake that for long they prevent he from speak fall on his knee before the bed he hold his wife ’s hand before his lip and kiss it and the hand with a weak movement of the finger respond to his kiss and meanwhile there at the foot of the bed in the deft hand of lizaveta petrovna like a flicker light in a lamp lie the life of a human creature which have never exist before and which would now with the same right with the same importance to itself live and create in its own image " alive alive and a boy too set your mind at rest " levin hear lizaveta petrovna say as she slap the baby ’s back with a shake hand " mamma be it true " say kitty ’s voice the princess ’s sob be all the answer she could make and in the midst of the silence there come in unmistakable reply to the mother ’s question a voice quite unlike the subdued voice speak in the room it be the bold clamorous selfassertive squall of the new human being who have so incomprehensibly appear if levin have be tell before that kitty be dead and that he have die with she and that their child be angel and that god be stand before he he would have be surprised at nothing but now come back to the world of reality he have to make great mental effort to take in that she be alive and well and that the creature squall so desperately be his son kitty be alive her agony be over and he be unutterably happy that he understand he be completely happy in it but the baby whence why who be he he could not get used to the idea it seem to he something extraneous superfluous to which he could not accustom himself at ten o’clock the old prince sergey ivanovitch and stepan arkadyevitch be sit at levin ’s have inquire after kitty they have drop into conversation upon other subject levin hear they and unconsciously as they talk go over the past over what have be up to that morning he think of himself as he have be yesterday till that point it be as though a hundred year have pass since then he feel himself exalt to unattainable height from which he studiously lower himself so as not to wound the people he be talk to he talk and be all the time think of his wife of her condition now of his son in whose existence he try to school himself into believe the whole world of woman which have take for he since his marriage a new value he have never suspect before be now so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination he hear they talk of yesterday ’s dinner at the club and think " what be happen with she now be she asleep how be she what be she think of be he cry my son dmitri " and in the middle of the conversation in the middle of a sentence he jump up and go out of the room " send I word if I can see she " say the prince " very well in a minute " answer levin and without stop he go to her room she be not asleep she be talk gently with her mother make plan about the christening carefully set to rights with hair wellbrushe in a smart little cap with some blue in it her arm out on the quilt she be lie on her back meet his eye her eye draw he to she her face bright before brighten still more as he draw near she there be the same change in it from earthly to unearthly that be see in the face of the dead but then it mean farewell here it mean welcome again a rush of emotion such as he have feel at the moment of the child ’s birth flood his heart she take his hand and ask he if he have sleep he could not answer and turn away struggle with his weakness " I have have a nap kostya " she say to he " and I be so comfortable now " she look at he but suddenly her expression change " give he to I " she say hear the baby ’s cry " give he to I lizaveta petrovna and he shall look at he " " to be sure his papa shall look at he " say lizaveta petrovna get up and bring something red and queer and wriggle " wait a minute we ’ll make he tidy first " and lizaveta petrovna lay the red wobble thing on the bed begin untrusse and truss up the baby lift it up and turn it over with one finger and powder it with something levin look at the tiny pitiful creature make strenuous effort to discover in his heart some trace of fatherly feeling for it he feel nothing towards it but disgust but when it be undress and he catch a glimpse of wee wee little hand little foot saffroncolored with little toe too and positively with a little big toe different from the rest and when he see lizaveta petrovna close the wideopen little hand as though they be soft spring and put they into linen garment such pity for the little creature come upon he and such terror that she would hurt it that he hold her hand back lizaveta petrovna laugh " do not be frightened do not be frightened " when the baby have be put to right and transform into a firm doll lizaveta petrovna dandle it as though proud of her handiwork and stand a little away so that levin might see his son in all his glory kitty look sideways in the same direction never take her eye off the baby " give he to I give he to I " she say and even make as though she would sit up " what be you think of katerina alexandrovna you must not move like that wait a minute I ’ll give he to you here we ’re show papa what a fine fellow we be " and lizaveta petrovna with one hand support the wobble head lift up on the other arm the strange limp red creature whose head be lose in its swaddling clothe but it have a nose too and slant eye and smack lip " a splendid baby " say lizaveta petrovna levin sigh with mortification this splendid baby excite in he no feeling but disgust and compassion it be not at all the feeling he have look forward to he turn away while lizaveta petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast suddenly laughter make he look round the baby have take the breast " come that ’ enough that ’ enough " say lizaveta petrovna but kitty would not let the baby go he fall asleep in her arm " look now " say kitty turn the baby so that he could see it the agedlooking little face suddenly pucker up still more and the baby sneeze smile hardly able to restrain his tear levin kiss his wife and go out of the dark room what he feel towards this little creature be utterly unlike what he have expect there be nothing cheerful and joyous in the feeling on the contrary it be a new torture of apprehension it be the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain and this sense be so painful at first the apprehension lest this helpless creature should suffer be so intense that it prevent he from notice the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he have feel when the baby sneeze stepan arkadyevitch ’s affair be in a very bad way the money for twothird of the forest have all be spend already and he have borrow from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount almost all the remaining third the merchant would not give more especially as darya alexandrovna for the first time that winter insist on her right to her own property have refuse to sign the receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest all his salary go on household expense and in payment of petty debt that could not be put off there be positively no money this be unpleasant and awkward and in stepan arkadyevitch ’s opinion thing could not go on like this the explanation of the position be in his view to be find in the fact that his salary be too small the post he fill have be unmistakably very good five year ago but it be so no long petrov the bank director have twelve thousand sventitsky a company director have seventeen thousand mitin who have found a bank receive fifty thousand " clearly I ’ve be nap and they ’ve overlook I " stepan arkadyevitch think about himself and he begin keep his eye and ear open and towards the end of the winter he have discover a very good berth and have form a plan of attack upon it at first from moscow through aunt uncle and friend and then when the matter be well advanced in the spring he go himself to petersburg it be one of those snug lucrative berth of which there be so many more nowadays than there use to be with income range from one thousand to fifty thousand rouble it be the post of secretary of the committee of the amalgamate agency of the southern railways and of certain banking company this position like all such appointment call for such immense energy and such varied qualification that it be difficult for they to be find unite in any one man and since a man combine all the qualification be not to be find it be at least well that the post be fill by an honest than by a dishonest man and stepan arkadyevitch be not merely an honest man — unemphatically — in the common acceptation of the word he be an honest man — emphatically — in that special sense which the word have in moscow when they talk of an " honest " politician an " honest " writer an " honest " newspaper an " honest " institution an " honest " tendency mean not simply that the man or the institution be not dishonest but that they be capable on occasion of take a line of their own in opposition to the authority stepan arkadyevitch move in those circle in moscow in which that expression have come into use be regard there as an honest man and so have more right to this appointment than other the appointment yield an income of from seven to ten thousand a year and oblonsky could fill it without give up his government position it be in the hand of two minister one lady and two jews and all these people though the way have be pave already with they stepan arkadyevitch have to see in petersburg besides this business stepan arkadyevitch have promise his sister anna to obtain from karenin a definite answer on the question of divorce and beg fifty rouble from dolly he set off for petersburg stepan arkadyevitch sit in karenin ’s study listen to his report on the cause of the unsatisfactory position of russian finance and only wait for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own business or about anna " yes that ’ very true " he say when alexey alexandrovitch take off the pincenez without which he could not read now and look inquiringly at his former brotherinlaw " that ’ very true in particular case but still the principle of our day be freedom " " yes but I lie down another principle embrace the principle of freedom " say alexey alexandrovitch with emphasis on the word " embracing " and he put on his pincenez again so as to read the passage in which this statement be make and turn over the beautifully write widemargined manuscript alexey alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage " I do not advocate protection for the sake of private interest but for the public weal and for the low and upper class equally " he say look over his pincenez at oblonsky " but they can not grasp that they be take up now with personal interest and carry away by phrase " stepan arkadyevitch know that when karenin begin to talk of what they be do and think the person who would not accept his report and be the cause of everything wrong in russia that it be come near the end and so now he eagerly abandon the principle of freetrade and fully agree alexey alexandrovitch pause thoughtfully turn over the page of his manuscript " oh by the way " say stepan arkadyevitch " I want to ask you some time when you see pomorsky to drop he a hint that I should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies " stepan arkadyevitch be familiar by now with the title of the post he covet and he bring it out rapidly without mistake alexey alexandrovitch question he as to the duty of this new committee and ponder he be consider whether the new committee would not be act in some way contrary to the view he have be advocate but as the influence of the new committee be of a very complex nature and his view be of very wide application he could not decide this straight off and take off his pincenez he say " of course I can mention it to he but what be your reason precisely for wish to obtain the appointment " " it ’ a good salary rise to nine thousand and my mean " " nine thousand " repeat alexey alexandrovitch and he frown the high figure of the salary make he reflect that on that side stepan arkadyevitch ’s propose position run counter to the main tendency of his own project of reform which always lean towards economy " I consider and I have embody my view in a note on the subject that in our day these immense salary be evidence of the unsound economic assiette of our finance " " but what ’ to be do " say stepan arkadyevitch " suppose a bank director get ten thousand — well he ’ worth it or an engineer get twenty thousand — after all it ’ a grow thing you know " " I assume that a salary be the price pay for a commodity and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand if the salary be fix without any regard for that law as for instance when I see two engineer leave college together both equally well train and efficient and one get forty thousand while the other be satisfied with two or when I see lawyer and hussar have no special qualification appoint director of banking company with immense salary I conclude that the salary be not fix in accordance with the law of supply and demand but simply through personal interest and this be an abuse of great gravity in itself and one that react injuriously on the government service I consider " stepan arkadyevitch make haste to interrupt his brotherinlaw " yes but you must agree that it ’ a new institution of undoubted utility that ’ be start after all you know it ’ a grow thing what they lie particular stress on be the thing be carry on honestly " say stepan arkadyevitch with emphasis but the moscow significance of the word " honest " be lose on alexey alexandrovitch " honesty be only a negative qualification " he say " well you ’ll do I a great service anyway " say stepan arkadyevitch " by put in a word to pomorsky — just in the way of conversation " " but I fancy it ’ more in volgarinov ’s hand " say alexey alexandrovitch " volgarinov have fully assent as far as he ’ concern " say stepan arkadyevitch turn red stepan arkadyevitch redden at the mention of that name because he have be that morning at the jew volgarinov ’s and the visit have leave an unpleasant recollection stepan arkadyevitch believe most positively that the committee in which he be try to get an appointment be a new genuine and honest public body but that morning when volgarinov have — intentionally beyond a doubt — keep he two hour wait with other petitioner in his waiting room he have suddenly feel uneasy whether he be uncomfortable that he a descendant of rurik prince oblonsky have be keep for two hour wait to see a jew or that for the first time in his life he be not follow the example of his ancestor in serve the government but be turn off into a new career anyway he be very uncomfortable during those two hour in volgarinov ’s waiting room stepan arkadyevitch step jauntily about the room pull his whisker enter into conversation with the other petitioner and invent an epigram on his position assiduously conceal from other and even from himself the feeling he be experience but all the time he be uncomfortable and angry he could not have say why — whether because he could not get his epigram just right or from some other reason when at last volgarinov have receive he with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation and have all but refuse the favor ask of he stepan arkadyevitch have make haste to forget it all as soon as possible and now at the mere recollection he blush " now there be something I want to talk about and you know what it be about anna " stepan arkadyevitch say pause for a brief space and shake off the unpleasant impression as soon as oblonsky utter anna ’s name the face of alexey alexandrovitch be completely transform all the life be go out of it and it look weary and dead " what be it exactly that you want from I " he say move in his chair and snap his pincenez " a definite settlement alexey alexandrovitch some settlement of the position I ’m appeal to you " " not as an injured husband " stepan arkadyevitch be go to say but afraid of wreck his negotiation by this he change the word " not as a statesman " which do not sound à propos " but simply as a man and a goodhearted man and a christian you must have pity on she " he say " that be in what way precisely " karenin say softly " yes pity on she if you have see she as I have — I have be spend all the winter with she — you would have pity on she her position be awful simply awful " " I have imagine " answer alexey alexandrovitch in a high almost shrill voice " that anna arkadyevna have everything she have desire for herself " " oh alexey alexandrovitch for heaven ’s sake do not let we indulge in recrimination what be past be past and you know what she want and be wait for — divorce " " but I believe anna arkadyevna refuse a divorce if I make it a condition to leave I my son I reply in that sense and suppose that the matter be end I consider it at an end " shriek alexey alexandrovitch " but for heaven ’s sake do not get hot " say stepan arkadyevitch touch his brotherinlaw ’s knee " the matter be not end if you will allow I to recapitulate it be like this when you part you be as magnanimous as could possibly be you be ready to give she everything — freedom divorce even she appreciate that no do not think that she do appreciate it — to such a degree that at the first moment feeling how she have wrong you she do not consider and could not consider everything she give up everything but experience time have show that her position be unbearable impossible " " the life of anna arkadyevna can have no interest for I " alexey alexandrovitch put in lift his eyebrow " allow I to disbelieve that " stepan arkadyevitch reply gently " her position be intolerable for she and of no benefit to anyone whatever she have deserve it you will say she know that and ask you for nothing she say plainly that she dare not ask you but I all of we her relative all who love she beg you entreat you why should she suffer who be any the well for it " " excuse I you seem to put I in the position of the guilty party " observe alexey alexandrovitch " oh no oh no not at all please understand I " say stepan arkadyevitch touch his hand again as though feel sure this physical contact would soften his brotherinlaw " all I say be this her position be intolerable and it might be alleviate by you and you will lose nothing by it I will arrange it all for you so that you ’ll not notice it you do promise it you know " " the promise be give before and I have suppose that the question of my son have settle the matter besides I have hope that anna arkadyevna have enough generosity " alexey alexandrovitch articulate with difficulty his lip twitch and his face white " she leave it all to your generosity she beg she implore one thing of you — to extricate she from the impossible position in which she be place she do not ask for her son now alexey alexandrovitch you be a good man put yourself in her position for a minute the question of divorce for she in her position be a question of life and death if you have not promise it once she would have reconcile herself to her position she would have go on live in the country but you promise it and she write to you and move to moscow and here she ’ be for six month in moscow where every chance meeting cut she to the heart every day expect an answer why it ’ like keep a condemn criminal for six month with the rope round his neck promise he perhaps death perhaps mercy have pity on she and I will undertake to arrange everything vos scrupules " " I be not talk about that about that " alexey alexandrovitch interrupt with disgust " but perhaps I promise what I have no right to promise " " so you go back from your promise " " I have never refuse to do all that be possible but I want time to consider how much of what I promise be possible " " no alexey alexandrovitch " cry oblonsky jump up " I will not believe that she ’ unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be and you can not refuse in such " " as much of what I promise as be possible vous professez d’être libre penseur but I as a believer can not in a matter of such gravity act in opposition to the christian law " " but in christian society and among we as far as I ’m aware divorce be allow " say stepan arkadyevitch " divorce be sanction even by our church and we see " " it be allow but not in the sense " " alexey alexandrovitch you be not like yourself " say oblonsky after a brief pause " be not it you and do not we all appreciate it in you who forgive everything and move simply by christian feeling be ready to make any sacrifice you say yourself if a man take thy coat give he thy cloak also and now " " I beg " say alexey alexandrovitch shrilly get suddenly onto his foot his face white and his jaw twitch " I beg you to drop this   to drop   this subject " " oh no oh forgive I forgive I if I have wound you " say stepan arkadyevitch hold out his hand with a smile of embarrassment " but like a messenger I have simply perform the commission give I " alexey alexandrovitch give he his hand ponder a little and say " I must think it over and seek for guidance the day after tomorrow I will give you a final answer " he say after consider a moment stepan arkadyevitch be about to go away when korney come in to announce " sergey alexyevitch " " who ’ sergey alexyevitch " stepan arkadyevitch be begin but he remember immediately " ah seryozha " he say aloud " sergey alexyevitch I think it be the director of a department anna ask I to see he too " he think and he recall the timid piteous expression with which anna have say to he at parting " anyway you will see he find out exactly where he be who be look after he and stiva   if it be possible could it be possible " stepan arkadyevitch know what be mean by that " if it be possible”—if it be possible to arrange the divorce so as to let she have her son stepan arkadyevitch see now that it be no good to dream of that but still he be glad to see his nephew alexey alexandrovitch remind his brotherinlaw that they never speak to the boy of his mother and he beg he not to mention a single word about she " he be very ill after that interview with his mother which we have not foresee " say alexey alexandrovitch " indeed we fear for his life but with rational treatment and seabathing in the summer he regain his strength and now by the doctor ’s advice I have let he go to school and certainly the companionship of school have have a good effect on he and he be perfectly well and make good progress " " what a fine fellow he ’ grow he ’ not seryozha now but quite fullfledged sergey alexyevitch " say stepan arkadyevitch smile as he look at the handsome broadshouldered lad in blue coat and long trouser who walk in alertly and confidently the boy look healthy and goodhumored he bow to his uncle as to a stranger but recognize he he blush and turn hurriedly away from he as though offend and irritated at something the boy go up to his father and hand he a note of the mark he have gain in school " well that ’ very fair " say his father " you can go " " he ’ thin and tall and have grow out of be a child into a boy I like that " say stepan arkadyevitch " do you remember I " the boy look back quickly at his uncle " yes mon oncle " he answer glance at his father and again he look downcast his uncle call he to he and take his hand " well and how be you get on " he say want to talk to he and not know what to say the boy blush and make no answer cautiously draw his hand away as soon as stepan arkadyevitch let go his hand he glance doubtfully at his father and like a bird set free he dart out of the room a year have pass since the last time seryozha have see his mother since then he have hear nothing more of she and in the course of that year he have go to school and make friend among his schoolfellow the dream and memory of his mother which have make he ill after see she do not occupy his thought now when they come back to he he studiously drive they away regard they as shameful and girlish below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy he know that his father and mother be separate by some quarrel he know that he have to remain with his father and he try to get used to that idea he dislike see his uncle so like his mother for it call up those memory of which he be ashamed he dislike it all the more as from some word he have catch as he wait at the study door and still more from the face of his father and uncle he guess that they must have be talk of his mother and to avoid condemn the father with whom he live and on whom he be dependent and above all to avoid give way to sentimentality which he consider so degrading seryozha try not to look at his uncle who have come to disturb his peace of mind and not to think of what he recall to he but when stepan arkadyevitch go out after he see he on the stair and call to he ask he how he spend his playtime at school seryozha talk more freely to he away from his father ’s presence " we have a railway now " he say in answer to his uncle ’s question " it ’ like this do you see two sit on a bench — they’re the passenger and one stand up straight on the bench and all be harness to it by their arm or by their belt and they run through all the room — the door be leave open beforehand well and it ’ pretty hard work be the conductor " " that ’ the one that stand " stepan arkadyevitch inquire smile " yes you want pluck for it and cleverness too especially when they stop all of a sudden or someone fall down " " yes that must be a serious matter " say stepan arkadyevitch watch with mournful interest the eager eye like his mother ’s not childish now — no long fully innocent and though he have promise alexey alexandrovitch not to speak of anna he could not restrain himself " do you remember your mother " he ask suddenly " no I do n’t " seryozha say quickly he blush crimson and his face cloud over and his uncle could get nothing more out of he his tutor find his pupil on the staircase half an hour later and for a long while he could not make out whether he be illtempered or cry " what be it I expect you hurt yourself when you fall down " say the tutor " I tell you it be a dangerous game and we shall have to speak to the director " " if I have hurt myself nobody should have find it out that ’ certain " " well what be it then " " leave I alone if I remember or if I do not remember what business be it of his why should I remember leave I in peace " he say address not his tutor but the whole world stepan arkadyevitch as usual do not waste his time in petersburg in petersburg besides business his sister ’s divorce and his coveted appointment he want as he always do to freshen himself up as he say after the mustiness of moscow in spite of its café chantant and its omnibus moscow be yet a stagnant bog stepan arkadyevitch always feel it after live for some time in moscow especially in close relation with his family he be conscious of a depression of spirit after be a long time in moscow without a change he reach a point when he positively begin to be worry himself over his wife ’s illhumor and reproach over his child ’s health and education and the petty detail of his official work even the fact of be in debt worry he but he have only to go and stay a little while in petersburg in the circle there in which he move where people live — really live — instead of vegetate as in moscow and all such idea vanish and melt away at once like wax before the fire his wife only that day he have be talk to prince tchetchensky prince tchetchensky have a wife and family grownup page in the corps   and he have another illegitimate family of child also though the first family be very nice too prince tchetchensky feel happy in his second family and he use to take his eld son with he to his second family and tell stepan arkadyevitch that he think it good for his son enlarge his idea what would have be say to that in moscow his child in petersburg child do not prevent their parent from enjoy life the child be bring up in school and there be no trace of the wild idea that prevail in moscow in lvov ’s household for instance that all the luxury of life be for the child while the parent have nothing but work and anxiety here people understand that a man be in duty bind to live for himself as every man of culture should live his official duty official work here be not the stiff hopeless drudgery that it be in moscow here there be some interest in official life a chance meeting a service render a happy phrase a knack of facetious mimicry and a man ’s career might be make in a trice so it have be with bryantsev whom stepan arkadyevitch have meet the previous day and who be one of the high functionary in government now there be some interest in official work like that the petersburg attitude on pecuniary matter have an especially soothe effect on stepan arkadyevitch bartnyansky who must spend at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he live in have make an interesting comment the day before on that subject as they be talk before dinner stepan arkadyevitch say to bartnyansky " you ’re friendly I fancy with mordvinsky you might do I a favor say a word to he please for I there ’ an appointment I should like to get — secretary of the agency " " oh I shall not remember all that if you tell it to I but what possess you to have to do with railways and jews take it as you will it ’ a low business " stepan arkadyevitch do not say to bartnyansky that it be a " growing thing”—bartnyansky would not have understand that " I want the money I ’ve nothing to live on " " you ’re live be not you " " yes but in debt " " be you though heavily " say bartnyansky sympathetically " very heavily twenty thousand " bartnyansky break into goodhumored laughter " oh lucky fellow " say he " my debt mount up to a million and a half and I ’ve nothing and still I can live as you see " and stepan arkadyevitch see the correctness of this view not in word only but in actual fact zhivahov owe three hundred thousand and have not a farthing to bless himself with and he live and in style too count krivtsov be consider a hopeless case by everyone and yet he keep two mistress petrovsky have run through five million and still live in just the same style and be even a manager in the financial department with a salary of twenty thousand but besides this petersburg have physically an agreeable effect on stepan arkadyevitch it make he young in moscow he sometimes find a gray hair in his head drop asleep after dinner stretch walk slowly upstairs breathe heavily be bore by the society of young woman and do not dance at ball in petersburg he always feel ten year young his experience in petersburg be exactly what have be describe to he on the previous day by prince pyotr oblonsky a man of sixty who have just come back from abroad " we do not know the way to live here " say pyotr oblonsky " I spend the summer in baden and you would not believe it I feel quite a young man at a glimpse of a pretty woman my thought one dine and drink a glass of wine and feel strong and ready for anything I come home to russia — have to see my wife and what ’ more go to my country place and there you ’d hardly believe it in a fortnight I ’d get into a dressing gown and give up dress for dinner need not say I have no thought leave for pretty woman I become quite an old gentleman there be nothing leave for I but to think of my eternal salvation I go off to paris — I be as right as could be at once " stepan arkadyevitch feel exactly the difference that pyotr oblonsky describe in moscow he degenerate so much that if he have have to be there for long together he might in good earnest have come to consider his salvation in petersburg he feel himself a man of the world again between princess betsy tverskaya and stepan arkadyevitch there have long exist rather curious relation stepan arkadyevitch always flirt with she in jest and use to say to she also in jest the most unseemly thing know that nothing delight she so much the day after his conversation with karenin stepan arkadyevitch go to see she and feel so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense he recklessly go so far that he do not know how to extricate himself as unluckily he be so far from be attract by she that he think she positively disagreeable what make it hard to change the conversation be the fact that he be very attractive to she so that he be considerably relieve at the arrival of princess myakaya which cut short their têteàtête " ah so you ’re here " say she when she see he " well and what news of your poor sister you need not look at I like that " she add " ever since they ’ve all turn against she all those who ’re a thousand time bad than she I ’ve think she do a very fine thing I can not forgive vronsky for not let I know when she be in petersburg I ’d have go to see she and go about with she everywhere please give she my love come tell I about she " " yes her position be very difficult she " begin stepan arkadyevitch in the simplicity of his heart accept as sterling coin princess myakaya ’s word " tell I about she " princess myakaya interrupt he immediately as she always do and begin talk herself " she ’ do what you all do except I — only they hide it but she would not be deceitful and she do a fine thing and she do well still in throw up that crazy brotherinlaw of yours you must excuse I everybody use to say he be so clever so very clever I be the only one that say he be a fool now that he ’ so thick with lidia ivanovna and landau you all say he ’ crazy and I should prefer not to agree with everybody but this time I can not help it " " oh do please explain " say stepan arkadyevitch " what do it mean yesterday I be see he on my sister ’s behalf and I ask he to give I a final answer he give I no answer and say he would think it over but this morning instead of an answer I receive an invitation from countess lidia ivanovna for this evening " " ah so that ’ it that ’ it " say princess myakaya gleefully " they ’re go to ask landau what he ’ to say " " ask landau what for who or what ’ landau " " what you do not know jules landau le fameux jules landau le clairvoyant he ’ crazy too but on he your sister ’s fate depend see what come of live in the province — you know nothing about anything landau do you see be a commis in a shop in paris and he go to a doctor ’s and in the doctor ’s waiting room he fall asleep and in his sleep he begin give advice to all the patient and wonderful advice it be then the wife of yury meledinsky — you know the invalid — hear of this landau and have he to see her husband and he cure her husband though I can not say that I see he do he much good for he ’ just as feeble a creature as ever he be but they believe in he and take he along with they and bring he to russia here there ’ be a general rush to he and he ’ begin doctor everyone he cure countess bezzubova and she take such a fancy to he that she adopt he " " adopt he " " yes as her son he ’ not landau any more now but count bezzubov that ’ neither here nor there though but lidia — i’m very fond of she but she have a screw loose somewhere — have lose her heart to this landau now and nothing be settle now in her house or alexey alexandrovitch ’s without he and so your sister ’s fate be now in the hand of landau alias count bezzubov " after a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drink at bartnyansky ’s stepan arkadyevitch only a little later than the appoint time go in to countess lidia ivanovna ’s " who else be with the countess — a frenchman " stepan arkadyevitch ask the hallporter as he glance at the familiar overcoat of alexey alexandrovitch and a queer rather artlesslooking overcoat with clasp " alexey alexandrovitch karenin and count bezzubov " the porter answer severely " princess myakaya guess right " think stepan arkadyevitch as he go upstairs " curious it would be quite as well though to get on friendly term with she she have immense influence if she would say a word to pomorsky the thing would be a certainty " it be still quite light outofdoors but in countess lidia ivanovna ’s little drawingroom the blind be draw and the lamp light at a round table under a lamp sit the countess and alexey alexandrovitch talk softly a short thinnish man very pale and handsome with feminine hip and knockkneed leg with fine brilliant eye and long hair lie on the collar of his coat be stand at the end of the room gaze at the portrait on the wall after greet the lady of the house and alexey alexandrovitch stepan arkadyevitch could not resist glance once more at the unknown man " monsieur landau " the countess address he with a softness and caution that impress oblonsky and she introduce they landau look round hurriedly come up and smile lay his moist lifeless hand in stepan arkadyevitch ’s outstretched hand and immediately walk away and fall to gaze at the portrait again the countess and alexey alexandrovitch look at each other significantly " I be very glad to see you particularly today " say countess lidia ivanovna point stepan arkadyevitch to a seat beside karenin " I introduce you to he as landau " she say in a soft voice glance at the frenchman and again immediately after at alexey alexandrovitch " but he be really count bezzubov as you ’re probably aware only he do not like the title " " yes I hear so " answer stepan arkadyevitch " they say he completely cure countess bezzubova " " she be here today poor thing " the countess say turn to alexey alexandrovitch " this separation be awful for she it ’ such a blow to she " " and he positively be go " query alexey alexandrovitch " yes he ’ go to paris he hear a voice yesterday " say countess lidia ivanovna look at stepan arkadyevitch " ah a voice " repeat oblonsky feeling that he must be as circumspect as he possibly could in this society where something peculiar be go on or be to go on to which he have not the key a moment ’s silence follow after which countess lidia ivanovna as though approach the main topic of conversation say with a fine smile to oblonsky " I ’ve know you for a long while and be very glad to make a close acquaintance with you les amis de nos amis sont nos amis but to be a true friend one must enter into the spiritual state of one ’s friend and I fear that you be not do so in the case of alexey alexandrovitch you understand what I mean " she say lift her fine pensive eye " in part countess I understand the position of alexey alexandrovitch " say oblonsky have no clear idea what they be talk about he want to confine himself to generality " the change be not in his external position " countess lidia ivanovna say sternly follow with eye of love the figure of alexey alexandrovitch as he get up and cross over to landau " his heart be change a new heart have be vouchsafe he and I fear you do not fully apprehend the change that have take place in he " " oh well in general outline I can conceive the change we have always be friendly and now " say stepan arkadyevitch respond with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess and mentally balance the question with which of the two minister she be most intimate so as to know about which to ask she to speak for he " the change that have take place in he can not lessen his love for his neighbor on the contrary that change can only intensify love in his heart but I be afraid you do not understand I will not you have some tea " she say with her eye indicate the footman who be hand round tea on a tray " not quite countess of course his misfortune " " yes a misfortune which have prove the high happiness when his heart be make new be fill full of it " she say gaze with eye full of love at stepan arkadyevitch " I do believe I might ask she to speak to both of they " think stepan arkadyevitch " oh of course countess " he say " but I imagine such change be a matter so private that no one even the most intimate friend would care to speak of they " " on the contrary we ought to speak freely and help one another " " yes undoubtedly so but there be such a difference of conviction and besides " say oblonsky with a soft smile " there can be no difference where it be a question of holy truth " " oh no of course but " and stepan arkadyevitch pause in confusion he understand at last that they be talk of religion " I fancy he will fall asleep immediately " say alexey alexandrovitch in a whisper full of mean go up to lidia ivanovna stepan arkadyevitch look round landau be sit at the window lean on his elbow and the back of his chair his head droop notice that all eye be turn on he he raise his head and smile a smile of childlike artlessness " do not take any notice " say lidia ivanovna and she lightly move a chair up for alexey alexandrovitch " I have observe " she be begin when a footman come into the room with a letter lidia ivanovna rapidly run her eye over the note and excuse herself write an answer with extraordinary rapidity hand it to the man and come back to the table " I have observe " she go on " that moscow people especially the man be more indifferent to religion than anyone " " oh no countess I think moscow people have the reputation of be the firm in the faith " answer stepan arkadyevitch " but as far as I can make out you be unfortunately one of the indifferent one " say alexey alexandrovitch turn to he with a weary smile " how anyone can be indifferent " say lidia ivanovna " I be not so much indifferent on that subject as I be wait in suspense " say stepan arkadyevitch with his most deprecating smile " I hardly think that the time for such question have come yet for I " alexey alexandrovitch and lidia ivanovna look at each other " we can never tell whether the time have come for we or not " say alexey alexandrovitch severely " we ought not to think whether we be ready or not ready god ’s grace be not guide by human consideration sometimes it come not to those that strive for it and come to those that be unprepared like saul " " no I believe it will not be just yet " say lidia ivanovna who have be meanwhile watch the movement of the frenchman landau get up and come to they " do you allow I to listen " he ask " oh yes I do not want to disturb you " say lidia ivanovna gaze tenderly at he " sit here with we " " one have only not to close one ’s eye to shut out the light " alexey alexandrovitch go on " ah if you know the happiness we know feel his presence ever in our heart " say countess lidia ivanovna with a rapturous smile " but a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height " say stepan arkadyevitch conscious of hypocrisy in admit this religious height but at the same time unable to bring himself to acknowledge his freethinking view before a person who by a single word to pomorsky might procure he the covet appointment " that is you mean that sin keep he back " say lidia ivanovna " but that be a false idea there be no sin for believer their sin have be atone for pardon " she add look at the footman who come in again with another letter she read it and give a verbal answer " tomorrow at the grand duchess ’s say " " for the believer sin be not " she go on " yes but faith without work be dead " say stepan arkadyevitch recall the phrase from the catechism and only by his smile cling to his independence " there you have it — from the epistle of st james " say alexey alexandrovitch address lidia ivanovna with a certain reproachfulness in his tone it be unmistakably a subject they have discuss more than once before " what harm have be do by the false interpretation of that passage nothing hold man back from belief like that misinterpretation ' I have not work so I can not believe ' though all the while that be not say but the very opposite be say " " strive for god save the soul by fast " say countess lidia ivanovna with disgusted contempt " those be the crude idea of our monk yet that be nowhere say it be far simple and easy " she add look at oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which at court she encourage youthful maid of honor disconcerted by the new surrounding of the court " we be save by christ who suffer for we we be save by faith " alexey alexandrovitch chime in with a glance of approval at her word " vous comprenez l’anglais " ask lidia ivanovna and receive a reply in the affirmative she get up and begin look through a shelf of book " I want to read he ' safe and happy ' or ' under the wing ' " she say look inquiringly at karenin and find the book and sit down again in her place she open it " it ’ very short in it be describe the way by which faith can be reach and the happiness above all earthly bliss with which it fill the soul the believer can not be unhappy because he be not alone but you will see " she be just settle herself to read when the footman come in again " madame borozdina tell she tomorrow at two o’clock yes " she say put her finger in the place in the book and gaze before she with her fine pensive eye " that be how true faith act you know marie sanina you know about her trouble she lose her only child she be in despair and what happen she find this comforter and she thank god now for the death of her child such be the happiness faith bring " " oh yes that be most " say stepan arkadyevitch glad they be go to read and let he have a chance to collect his faculty " no I see I ’d well not ask she about anything today " he think " if only I can get out of this without put my foot in it " " it will be dull for you " say countess lidia ivanovna address landau " you do not know english but it ’ short " " oh I shall understand " say landau with the same smile and he close his eye alexey alexandrovitch and lidia ivanovna exchange meaningful glance and the reading begin stepan arkadyevitch feel completely nonplussed by the strange talk which he be hear for the first time the complexity of petersburg as a rule have a stimulating effect on he rouse he out of his moscow stagnation but he like these complication and understand they only in the circle he know and be at home in in these unfamiliar surrounding he be puzzled and disconcerted and could not get his bearing as he listen to countess lidia ivanovna aware of the beautiful artless — or perhaps artful he could not decide which — eye of landau fix upon he stepan arkadyevitch begin to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head the most incongruous idea be in confusion in his head " marie sanina be glad her child ’ dead how good a smoke would be now to be save one need only believe and the monk do not know how the thing ’ to be do but countess lidia ivanovna do know and why be my head so heavy be it the cognac or all this be so queer anyway I fancy I ’ve do nothing unsuitable so far but anyway it will not do to ask she now they say they make one say one ’s prayer I only hope they will not make I that ’ll be too imbecile and what stuff it be she ’ read but she have a good accent landau — bezzubov — what ’ he bezzubov for " all at once stepan arkadyevitch become aware that his low jaw be uncontrollably form a yawn he pull his whisker to cover the yawn and shake himself together but soon after he become aware that he be drop asleep and on the very point of snoring he recover himself at the very moment when the voice of countess lidia ivanovna be say " he ’ asleep " stepan arkadyevitch start with dismay feel guilty and catch but he be reassure at once by see that the word " he ’ asleep " refer not to he but to landau the frenchman be asleep as well as stepan arkadyevitch but stepan arkadyevitch ’s be asleep would have offend they as he think though even this he think might not be so as everything seem so queer while landau ’s be asleep delight they extremely especially countess lidia ivanovna " mon ami " say lidia ivanovna carefully hold the fold of her silk gown so as not to rustle and in her excitement call karenin not alexey alexandrovitch but " mon ami " " donnezlui la main vous voyez sh " she hiss at the footman as he come in again " not at home " the frenchman be asleep or pretend to be asleep with his head on the back of his chair and his moist hand as it lie on his knee make faint movement as though try to catch something alexey alexandrovitch get up try to move carefully but stumble against the table go up and lay his hand in the frenchman ’s hand stepan arkadyevitch get up too and open his eye wide try to wake himself up if he be asleep he look first at one and then at the other it be all real stepan arkadyevitch feel that his head be get bad and bad " que la personne qui est arrivée la dernière celle qui demande qu’elle sorte qu’elle sorte " articulate the frenchman without open his eye " vous m’excuserez mais vous voyez revenez vers dix heures encore mieux demain " " qu’elle sorte " repeat the frenchman impatiently " c’est moi n’estce pas " and receive an answer in the affirmative stepan arkadyevitch forget the favor he have mean to ask of lidia ivanovna and forget his sister ’s affair care for nothing but fill with the sole desire to get away as soon as possible go out on tiptoe and run out into the street as though from a plaguestricken house for a long while he chat and joke with his cabdriver try to recover his spirit at the french theater where he arrive for the last act and afterwards at the tatar restaurant after his champagne stepan arkadyevitch feel a little refreshed in the atmosphere he be use to but still he feel quite unlike himself all that evening on get home to pyotr oblonsky ’s where he be stay stepan arkadyevitch find a note from betsy she write to he that she be very anxious to finish their interrupt conversation and beg he to come next day he have scarcely read this note and frown at its content when he hear below the ponderous tramp of the servant carry something heavy stepan arkadyevitch go out to look it be the rejuvenated pyotr oblonsky he be so drunk that he could not walk upstairs but he tell they to set he on his leg when he see stepan arkadyevitch and cling to he walk with he into his room and there begin tell he how he have spend the evening and fall asleep do so stepan arkadyevitch be in very low spirit which happen rarely with he and for a long while he could not go to sleep everything he could recall to his mind everything be disgusting but most disgusting of all as if it be something shameful be the memory of the evening he have spend at countess lidia ivanovna ’s next day he receive from alexey alexandrovitch a final answer refuse to grant anna ’s divorce and he understand that this decision be base on what the frenchman have say in his real or pretended trance in order to carry through any undertaking in family life there must necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife or love agreement when the relation of a couple be vacillate and neither one thing nor the other no sort of enterprise can be undertake many family remain for year in the same place though both husband and wife be sick of it simply because there be neither complete division nor agreement between they both vronsky and anna feel life in moscow insupportable in the heat and dust when the spring sunshine be follow by the glare of summer and all the tree in the boulevard have long since be in full leaf and the leave be cover with dust but they do not go back to vozdvizhenskoe as they have arrange to do long before they go on stay in moscow though they both loathe it because of late there have be no agreement between they the irritability that keep they apart have no external cause and all effort to come to an understanding intensify it instead of remove it it be an inner irritation ground in her mind on the conviction that his love have grow less in his on regret that he have put himself for her sake in a difficult position which she instead of lighten make still more difficult neither of they give full utterance to their sense of grievance but they consider each other in the wrong and try on every pretext to prove this to one another in her eye the whole of he with all his habit idea desire with all his spiritual and physical temperament be one thing — love for woman and that love she feel ought to be entirely concentrate on she alone that love be less consequently as she reason he must have transfer part of his love to other woman or to another woman — and she be jealous she be jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love not have get an object for her jealousy she be on the lookout for it at the slight hint she transfer her jealousy from one object to another at one time she be jealous of those low woman with whom he might so easily renew his old bachelor tie then she be jealous of the society woman he might meet then she be jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to marry for whose sake he would break with she and this last form of jealousy torture she most of all especially as he have unwarily tell she in a moment of frankness that his mother know he so little that she have have the audacity to try and persuade he to marry the young princess sorokina and be jealous of he anna be indignant against he and find ground for indignation in everything for everything that be difficult in her position she blame he the agonizing condition of suspense she have pass in moscow the tardiness and indecision of alexey alexandrovitch her solitude — she put it all down to he if he have love she he would have see all the bitterness of her position and would have rescue she from it for she be in moscow and not in the country he be to blame too he could not live bury in the country as she would have like to do he must have society and he have put she in this awful position the bitterness of which he would not see and again it be his fault that she be forever separate from her son even the rare moment of tenderness that come from time to time do not soothe she in his tenderness now she see a shade of complacency of selfconfidence which have not be of old and which exasperate she it be dusk anna be alone and wait for he to come back from a bachelor dinner she walk up and down in his study the room where the noise from the street be least hear and think over every detail of their yesterday ’s quarrel go back from the wellremembere offensive word of the quarrel to what have be the ground of it she arrive at last at its origin for a long while she could hardly believe that their dissension have arise from a conversation so inoffensive of so little moment to either but so it actually have be it all arise from his laugh at the girl ' high school declare they be useless while she defend they he have speak slightingly of woman ’s education in general and have say that hannah anna ’s english protégée have not the slight need to know anything of physic this irritate anna she see in this a contemptuous reference to her occupation and she bethink she of a phrase to pay he back for the pain he have give she " I do not expect you to understand I my feeling as anyone who love I might but simple delicacy I do expect " she say and he have actually flush with vexation and have say something unpleasant she could not recall her answer but at that point with an unmistakable desire to wound she too he have say " I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl that ’ true because I see it ’ unnatural " the cruelty with which he shatter the world she have build up for herself so laboriously to enable she to endure her hard life the injustice with which he have accuse she of affectation of artificiality arouse she " I be very sorry that nothing but what ’ coarse and material be comprehensible and natural to you " she say and walk out of the room when he have come in to she yesterday evening they have not refer to the quarrel but both feel that the quarrel have be smooth over but be not at an end today he have not be at home all day and she feel so lonely and wretched in be on bad term with he that she want to forget it all to forgive he and be reconcile with he she want to throw the blame on herself and to justify he " I be myself to blame I ’m irritable I ’m insanely jealous I will make it up with he and we ’ll go away to the country there I shall be more at peace " " unnatural " she suddenly recall the word that have sting she most of all not so much the word itself as the intent to wound she with which it be say " I know what he mean he mean — unnatural not

love and there be none so then all be over " she repeat the word she have say " and it must be end " " but how " she ask herself and she sit down in a low chair before the lookingglass thought of where she would go now whether to the aunt who have bring she up to dolly or simply alone abroad and of what he be do now alone in his study whether this be the final quarrel or whether reconciliation be still possible and of what all her old friend at petersburg would say of she now and of how alexey alexandrovitch would look at it and many other idea of what would happen now after this rupture come into her head but she do not give herself up to they with all her heart at the bottom of her heart be some obscure idea that alone interest she but she could not get clear sight of it think once more of alexey alexandrovitch she recall the time of her illness after her confinement and the feeling which never leave she at that time " why do not I die " and the word and the feeling of that time

calm and declare that there be no trace of foundation for her jealousy that he have never cease and never would cease to love she that he love she more than ever " anna why distress yourself and I so " he say to she kiss her hand there be tenderness now in his face and she fancy she catch the sound of tear in his voice and she feel they wet on her hand and instantly anna ’s despairing jealousy

out of the room before leave the house vronsky go into her room she would have pretend to be look for something on the table but ashamed of make a pretense she look straight in his face with cold eye " what do you want " she ask in french " to get the guarantee for gambetta I ’ve sell he " he say in a tone which say more clearly than word " I ’ve no time for discuss thing and it would lead to nothing " " I ’m not to blame in any way " he think " if she will punish herself tant pis pour elle but as he be go he fancy that she say something and his heart suddenly ache with pity for she " eh anna " he query " I say nothing " she answer just as coldly and calmly " oh nothing tant pis then " he think feel cold again and he turn and go out as he be go out he catch a glimpse in the lookingglass of her face white with quiver lip he even want to stop and to say some comforting word to she but his leg carry he out of the room before he could think what to say the whole of that day he spend away from home and when he come in late in the evening the maid tell he that anna arkadyevna have a headache and beg he not to go in to she never before have a day be pass in quarrel today be the first time and this be not a quarrel it be the open acknowledgment of complete coldness be it possible to glance at she as he have glance when he come into the room for the guarantee — to look at she see her heart be break with despair and go out without a word with that face of callous composure he be not merely cold to she he hate she because he love another woman — that be clear and remember all the cruel word he have say anna supply too the word that he have unmistakably wish to say and could have say to she and she grow more and more exasperated " I will not prevent you " he might say " you can go where you like you be unwilling to be divorce from your husband no doubt so that you might go back to he go back to he if you want money I ’ll give it to you how many rouble do you want " all the most cruel word that a brutal man could say he say to she in her imagination and she could not forgive he for they as though he have actually say they " but do not he only yesterday swear he love I he a truthful and sincere man have not I despair for nothing many time already " she say to herself afterwards all that day except for the visit to wilson ’s which occupy two hour anna spend in doubt whether everything be over or whether there be still hope of reconciliation whether she should go away at once or see he once more she be expect he the whole day and in the evening as she go to her own room leave a message for he that her head ache she say to herself " if he come in spite of what the maid say it mean that he love I still if not it mean that all be over and then I will decide what I ’m to do " in the evening she hear the rumbling of his carriage stop at the entrance his ring his step and his conversation with the servant he believe what be tell he do not care to find out more and go to his own room so then everything be over and death rise clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole mean of bring back love for she in his heart of punish he and of gain the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her heart be wage with he now nothing matter go or not go to vozdvizhenskoe get or not get a divorce from her husband — all that do not matter the one thing that matter be punish he when she pour herself out her usual dose of opium and think that she have only to drink off the whole bottle to die it seem to she so simple and easy that she begin muse with enjoyment on how he would suffer and repent and love her memory when it would be too late she lie in bed with open eye by the light of a single burneddown candle gaze at the carved cornice of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that cover part of it while she vividly picture to herself how he would feel when she would be no more when she would be only a memory to he " how could I say such cruel thing to she " he would say " how could I go out of the room without say anything to she but now she be no more she have go away from we forever she be " suddenly the shadow of the screen waver pounce on the whole cornice the whole ceiling other shadow from the other side swoop to meet it for an instant the shadow flit back but then with fresh swiftness they dart forward waver commingle and all be darkness " death " she think and such horror come upon she that for a long while she could not realize where she be and for a long while her tremble hand could not find the match and light another candle instead of the one that have burn down and go out " no anything — only to live why I love he why he love I this have be before and will pass " she say feel that tear of joy at the return to life be trickle down her cheek and to escape from her panic she go hurriedly to his room he be asleep there and sleep soundly she go up to he and hold the light above his face she gaze a long while at he now when he be asleep she love he so that at the sight of he she could not keep back tear of tenderness but she know that if he wake up he would look at she with cold eye convinced that he be right and that before tell he of her love she would have to prove to he that he have be wrong in his treatment of she without wake he she go back and after a second dose of opium she fall towards morning into a heavy incomplete sleep during which she never quite lose consciousness in the morning she be wake by a horrible nightmare which have recur several time in her dream even before her connection with vronsky a little old man with unkempt beard be do something bent down over some iron mutter meaningless french word and she as she always do in this nightmare it be what make the horror of it feel that this peasant be take no notice of she but be do something horrible with the iron — over she and she wake up in a cold sweat when she get up the previous day come back to she as though veil in mist " there be a quarrel just what have happen several time I say I have a headache and he do not come in to see I tomorrow we ’re go away I must see he and get

sorokina and her daughter they come and bring I the money and the deed from maman I could not get they yesterday how be your head well " he say quietly not wish to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face she look silently intently at he stand in the middle of the room he glance at she frown for a moment and go on read a letter she turn and go deliberately out of the room he still might have turn she back but she have reach the door he be still silent and the only sound audible be the rustling of the note paper as he turn it " oh by the way " he say at the very moment

" " you   you will be sorry for this " she say and go out frightened by the desperate expression with which these word be utter he jump up and would have run after she but on second thought he sit down and scowl set his tooth this vulgar — as he think it — threat of something vague exasperate he " I ’ve try everything " he think " the only thing leave be not to pay attention " and he begin to get ready to drive into town and again to his mother ’s to get her signature to the deed she hear the sound of his step about the study and the diningroom at the drawingroom he stand still but he do not turn in to see she he merely give an order that the horse should be give to voytov if he come while he be away then she hear the carriage bring round the door open and he come out again but he go

she have be very ill " " so I hear may I see the letter " " I ’ll get it directly but he do not refuse on the contrary stiva have hope " say dolly stop in the doorway " I have not and indeed I do not wish it " say anna " what ’ this do kitty consider it degrade to meet I " think anna when she be alone " perhaps she ’ right too but it ’ not for she the girl who be in love with vronsky it ’ not for she to show I that even if it be true I know that in my position I can not be receive by any decent woman I know that from the first moment I sacrifice everything to he and this be my reward oh how I hate he and what do I come here for I ’m bad here more miserable " she hear from the next room the sister ' voice in consultation " and what be I go to say to dolly now amuse kitty by the sight of my wretchedness submit to she patronize no and besides dolly would not understand and it would be no good my tell she it would only be interesting to see kitty to show she how I despise everyone and everything how nothing matter to I now " dolly come in with the letter anna read it and hand it back in silence " I know all that " she say " and it do not interest I in the least " " oh why so on the contrary I have hope " say dolly look inquisitively at anna she have never see she in such a strangely irritable condition " when be you go away " she ask anna halfclose her eye look straight before she and do not answer " why do kitty shrink from I " she say look at the door and flush red " oh what nonsense she ’ nurse and thing be not go right with she and I ’ve be advise she she ’ delighted she ’ll be here in a minute " say dolly awkwardly not clever at lie " yes here she be " hear that anna have call kitty have want not to appear but dolly persuade she rally her force kitty go in walk up to she blush and shake hand " I be so glad to see you " she say with a trembling voice kitty have be throw into confusion by the inward conflict between her antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to she but as soon as she see anna ’s lovely and attractive face all feeling of antagonism disappear " I should not have be surprised if you have not care to meet I I ’m used to everything you have be ill yes you be change " say anna kitty feel that anna be look at she with hostile eye she ascribe this hostility to the awkward position in which anna who have once patronize she must feel with she now and she feel sorry for she they talk of kitty ’s illness of the baby of stiva but it be obvious that nothing interest anna " I come to say goodbye to you " she say get up " oh when be you go " but again not answer anna turn to kitty " yes I be very glad to have see you " she say with a smile " I have hear so much of you from everyone even from your husband he come to see I and I like he exceedingly " she say unmistakably with malicious intent " where be he " " he have go back to the country " say kitty blush " remember I to he be sure you do " " I ’ll be sure to " kitty say naïvely look compassionately into her eye " so goodbye dolly " and kiss dolly and shake hand with kitty anna go out hurriedly " she ’ just the same and just as charming she ’ very lovely " say kitty when she be alone with her sister " but there ’ something piteous about she awfully piteous " " yes there ’ something unusual about she today " say dolly " when I go with she into the hall I fancy she be almost cry " anna get into the carriage again in an even bad frame of mind than when she set out from home to her previous torture be add now that sense of mortification and of be an outcast which she have feel so distinctly on meet kitty " where to home " ask pyotr " yes home " she say not even think now where she be go " how they look at I as something dreadful incomprehensible and curious what can he be tell the other with such warmth " she think stare at two man who walk by " can one ever tell anyone what one be feel I mean to tell dolly and it ’ a good thing I do not tell she how pleased she would have be at my misery she would have conceal it but her chief feeling would have be delight at my be punish for the happiness she envy I for kitty she would have be even more pleased how I can see through she she know I be more than usually sweet to her husband and she ’ jealous and hate I and she despise I in her eye I ’m an immoral woman if I be an immoral woman I could have make her husband fall in love with I   if I ’d care to and indeed I do care to there ’ someone who ’ pleased with himself " she think as she see a fat rubicund gentleman come towards she he take she for an acquaintance and lift his glossy hat above his bald glossy head and then perceive his mistake " he think he know I well he know I as well as anyone in the world know I I do not know myself I know my appetite as the french say they want that dirty ice cream that they do know for certain " she think look at two boy stop an ice cream seller who take a barrel off his head and begin wipe his perspire face with a towel " we all want what be sweet and nice if not sweetmeats then a dirty ice and kitty ’ the same — if not vronsky then levin and she envy I and hate I and we all hate each other I kitty kitty I yes that ’ the truth ' tiutkin coiffeur ' je me fais coiffer par tiutkin I ’ll tell he that when he come " she think and smile but the same instant she remember that she have no one now to tell anything amusing to " and there ’ nothing amusing nothing mirthful really it ’ all hateful they ’re singe for vesper and how carefully that merchant cross himself as if he be afraid of miss something why these church and this singing and this humbug simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab driver who be abuse each other so angrily yashvin say ' he want to strip I of my shirt and I he of his ' yes that ’ the truth " she be plunge in these thought which so engross she that she leave off think of her own position when the carriage draw up at the step of her house it be only when she see the porter run out to meet she that she remember she have send the note and the telegram " be there an answer " she inquire " I ’ll see this minute " answer the porter and glance into his room he take out and give she the thin square envelope of a telegram " I can not come before ten o’clock — vronsky " she read " and have not the messenger come back " " no " answer the porter " then since it ’ so I know what I must do " she say and feel a vague fury and craving for revenge rise up within she she run upstairs " I ’ll go to he myself before go away forever I ’ll tell he all never have I hate anyone as I hate that man " she think see his hat on the rack she shudder with aversion she do not consider that his telegram be an answer to her telegram and that he have not yet receive her note she picture he to herself as talk calmly to his mother and princess sorokina and rejoice at her suffering " yes I must go quickly " she say not know yet where she be go she long to get away as quickly as possible from the feeling she have go through in that awful house the servant the wall the thing in that house — all arouse repulsion and hatred in she and lie like a weight upon she " yes I must go to the railway station and if he ’ not there then go there and catch he " anna look at the railway timetable in the newspaper an evening train go at two minute past eight " yes I shall be in time " she give order for the other horse to be put in the carriage and pack in a travelingbag the thing need for a few day she know she would never come back here again   among the plan that come into her head she vaguely determine that after what would happen at the station or at the countess ’s house she would go as far as the first town on the nizhni road and stop there   dinner be on the table she go up but the smell of the bread and cheese be enough to make she feel that all food be disgusting she order the carriage and go out the house throw a shadow now right across the street but it be a bright evening and still warm in the sunshine annushka who come down with her thing and pyotr who put the thing in the carriage and the coachman evidently out of humor be all hateful to she and irritate she by their word and action   " I do not want you pyotr "   " but how about the ticket "   " well as you like it do not matter " she say crossly   pyotr jump on the box and put his arm akimbo tell the coachman to drive to the bookingoffice     " here it be again again I understand it all " anna say to herself as soon as the carriage have start and sway lightly rumble over the tiny cobble of the paved road and again one impression follow rapidly upon another   " yes what be the last thing I think of so clearly " she try to recall it " ' tiutkin coiffeur’—no not that yes of what yashvin say the struggle for existence and hatred be the one thing that hold man together no it ’ a useless journey you ’re make " she say mentally address a party in a coach and four evidently go for an excursion into the country " and the dog you ’re take with you will be no help to you you can not get away from yourselves " turn her eye in the direction pyotr have turn to look she see a factoryhand almost deaddrunk with hang head be lead away by a policeman " come he ’ find a quick way " she think " count vronsky and I do not find that happiness either though we expect so much from it " and now for the first time anna turn that glaring light in which she be see everything on to her relation with he which she have hitherto avoid think about " what be it he seek in I not love so much as the satisfaction of vanity " she remember his word the expression of his face that recall an abject setterdog in the early day of their connection and everything now confirm this " yes there be the triumph of success in he of course there be love too but the chief element be the pride of success he boast of I now that ’ over there ’ nothing to be proud of not to be proud of but to be ashamed of he have take from I all he could and now I be no use to he he be weary of I and be try not to be dishonorable in his behavior to I he let that out yesterday — he want divorce and marriage so as to burn his ship he love I but how the zest be go as the english say that fellow want everyone to admire he and be very much pleased with himself " she think look at a redfaced clerk ride on a ridingschool horse " yes there ’ not the same flavor about I for he now if I go away from he at the bottom of his heart he will be glad "   this be not mere supposition she see it distinctly in the pierce light which reveal to she now the meaning of life and human relation   " my love keep grow more passionate and egoistic while his be wane and wane and that ’ why we ’re drift apart " she go on muse " and there ’ no help for it he be everything for I and I want he more and more to give himself up to I entirely and he want more and more to get away from I we walk to meet each other up to the time of our love and then we have be irresistibly drift in different direction and there ’ no altering that he tell I I ’m insanely jealous and I have tell myself that I be insanely jealous but it ’ not true I ’m not jealous but I ’m unsatisfied but " she open her lip and shift her place in the carriage in the excitement arouse by the thought that suddenly strike she " if I could be anything but a mistress passionately care for nothing but his caress but I can not and I do not care to be anything else and by that desire I rouse aversion in he and he rouse fury in I and it can not be different do not I know that he would not deceive I that he have no scheme about princess sorokina that he ’ not in love with kitty that he will not desert I I know all that but it make it no well for I if without love I from duty he ’ll be good and kind to I without what I want that ’ a thousand time bad than unkindness that’ — hell and that ’ just how it be for a long while now he have not love I and where love end hate begin I do not know these street at all hill it seem and still house and house and in the house always people and people how many of they no end and all hate each other come let I try and think what I want to make I happy well suppose I be divorce and alexey alexandrovitch let I have seryozha and I marry vronsky " think of alexey alexandrovitch she at once picture he with extraordinary vividness as though he be alive before she with his mild lifeless dull eye the blue vein in his white hand his intonation and the cracking of his finger and remember the feeling which have exist between they and which be also call love she shudder with loathing " well I ’m divorce and become vronsky ’s wife well will kitty cease look at I as she look at I today no and will seryozha leave off ask and wonder about my two husband and be there any new feeling I can awaken between vronsky and I be there possible if not happiness some sort of ease from misery no no " she answer now without the slight hesitation " impossible we be draw apart by life and I make his unhappiness and he mine and there ’ no alter he or I every attempt have be make the screw have come unscrewed oh a beggar woman with a baby she think I ’m sorry for she be not we all fling into the world only to hate each other and so to torture ourselves and each other schoolboy come — laugh seryozha " she think " I think too that I love he and use to be touch by my own tenderness but I have live without he I give he up for another love and do not regret the exchange till that love be satisfy " and with loathing she think of what she mean by that love and the clearness with which she see life now her own and all man ’s be a pleasure to she " it ’ so with I and pyotr and the coachman fyodor and that merchant and all the people live along the volga where those placard invite one to go and everywhere and always " she think when she have drive under the lowpitched roof of the nizhigorod station and the porter run to meet she   " a ticket to obiralovka " say pyotr   she have utterly forget where and why she be go and only by a great effort she understand the question   " yes " she say hand he her purse and take a little red bag in her hand she get out of the carriage   make her way through the crowd to the firstclass waitingroom she gradually recollect all the detail of her position and the plan between which she be hesitate and again at the old sore place hope and then despair poison the wound of her torture fearfully throb heart as she sit on the starshaped sofa wait for the train she gaze with aversion at the people come and go they be all hateful to she and think how she would arrive at the station would write he a note and what she would write to he and how he be at this moment complain to his mother of his position not understand her suffering and how she would go into the room and what she would say to he then she think that life might still be happy and how miserably she love and hate he and how fearfully her heart be beat     a bell ring some young man ugly and impudent and at the same time careful of the impression they be make hurry by pyotr too cross the room in his livery and topboot with his dull animal face and come up to she to take she to the train some noisy man be quiet as she pass they on the platform and one whisper something about she to another — something vile no doubt she step up on the high step and sit down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that have be white her bag lie beside she shake up and down by the springiness of the seat with a foolish smile pyotr raise his hat with its colored band at the window in token of farewell an impudent conductor slam the door and the latch a grotesquelooking lady wear a bustle anna mentally undress the woman and be appal at her hideousness and a little girl laugh affectedly run down the platform   " katerina andreevna she ’ get they all ma tante " cry the girl   " even the child ’s hideous and affected " think anna to avoid see anyone she get up quickly and seat herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage a misshapenlooking peasant cover with dirt in a cap from which his tangled hair stick out all round pass by that window stoop down to the carriage wheel " there ’ something familiar about that hideous peasant " think anna and remember her dream she move away to the opposite door shake with terror the conductor open the door and let in a man and his wife   " do you wish to get out "   anna make no answer the conductor and her two fellowpassenger do not notice under her veil her panicstricken face she go back to her corner and sit down the couple seat themselves on the opposite side and intently but surreptitiously scrutinize her clothe both husband and wife seem repulsive to anna the husband ask would she allow he to smoke obviously not with a view to smoking but to get into conversation with she receive her assent he say to his wife in french something about care less to smoke than to talk they make inane and affected remark to one another entirely for her benefit anna see clearly that they be sick of each other and hate each other and no one could have help hate such miserable monstrosity   a second bell sound and be follow by moving of luggage noise shouting and laughter it be so clear to anna that there be nothing for anyone to be glad of that this laughter irritate she agonizingly and she would have like to stop up her ear not to hear it at last the third bell ring there be a whistle and a hiss of steam and a clank of chain and the man in her carriage cross himself " it would be interesting to ask he what meaning he attach to that " think anna look angrily at he she look past the lady out of the window at the people who seem whirl by as they run beside the train or stand on the platform the train jerk at regular interval at the junction of the rail roll by the platform past a stone wall a signalbox past other train the wheel move more smoothly and evenly resound with a slight clang on the rail the window be light up by the bright evening sun and a slight breeze flutter the curtain anna forget her fellow passenger and to the light swaying of the train she fall to think again as she breathe the fresh air   " yes what do I stop at that I could not conceive a position in which life would not be a misery that we be all create to be miserable and that we all know it and all invent mean of deceive each other and when one see the truth what be one to do "   " that ’ what reason be give man for to escape from what worry he " say the lady in french lisp affectedly and obviously pleased with her phrase   the word seem an answer to anna ’s thought   " to escape from what worry he " repeat anna and glance at the redcheeked husband and the thin wife she see that the sickly wife consider herself misunderstand and the husband deceive she and encourage she in that idea of herself anna seem to see all their history and all the cranny of their soul as it be turn a light upon they but there be nothing interesting in they and she pursue her thought   " yes I ’m very much worried and that ’ what reason be give I for to escape so then one must escape why not put out the light when there ’ nothing more to look at when it ’ sickening to look at it all but how why do the conductor run along the footboard why be they shriek those young man in that train why be they talk why be they laugh it ’ all falsehood all you all humbug all cruelty "   when the train come into the station anna get out into the crowd of passenger and move apart from they as if they be leper she stand on the platform try to think what she have come here for and what she mean to do everything that have seem to she possible before be now so difficult to consider especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave she alone one moment porter run up to she proffer their service then young man clack their heel on the plank of the platform and talk loudly stare at her people meet she dodge past on the wrong side remember that she have mean to go on far if there be no answer she stop a porter and ask if her coachman be not here with a note from count vronsky   " count vronsky they send up here from the vronskys just this minute to meet princess sorokina and her daughter and what be the coachman like "   just as she be talk to the porter the coachman mihail red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain evidently proud of have so successfully perform his commission come up to she and give she a letter she break it open and her heart ache before she have read it   " I be very sorry your note do not reach I I will be home at ten " vronsky have write carelessly   " yes that ’ what I expect " she say to herself with an evil smile   " very good you can go home then " she say softly address mihail she speak softly because the rapidity of her heart ’s beating hinder she breathing " no I will not let you make I miserable " she think menacingly address not he not herself but the power that make she suffer and she walk along the platform   two maidservant walk along the platform turn their head stare at she and make some remark about her dress " real " they say of the lace she be wear the young man would not leave she in peace again they pass by peer into her face and with a laugh shout something in an unnatural voice the stationmaster come up ask she whether she be go by train a boy sell kva never take his eye off she " my god where be I to go " she think go far and far along the platform at the end she stop some lady and child who have come to meet a gentleman in spectacle pause in their loud laughter and talk and stare at she as she reach they she quicken her pace and walk away from they to the edge of the platform a luggage train be come in the platform begin to sway and she fancy she be in the train again   and all at once she think of the man crush by the train the day she have first meet vronsky and she know what she have to do with a rapid light step she go down the step that lead from the tank to the rail and stop quite near the approach train   she look at the low part of the carriage at the screw and chain and the tall castiron wheel of the first carriage slowly move up and try to measure the middle between the front and back wheel and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite she   " there " she say to herself look into the shadow of the carriage at the sand and coal dust which cover the sleepers—“there in the very middle and I will punish he and escape from everyone and from myself "   she try to fling herself below the wheel of the first carriage as it reach she but the red bag which she try to drop out of her hand delay she and she be too late she miss the moment she have to wait for the next carriage a feeling such as she have know when about to take the first plunge in bathing come upon she and she cross herself that familiar gesture bring back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memory and suddenly the darkness that have cover everything for she be tear apart and life rise up before she for an instant with all its bright past joy but she do not take her eye from the wheel of the second carriage and exactly at the moment when the space between the wheel come opposite she she drop the red bag and draw her head back into her shoulder fall on her hand under the carriage and lightly as though she would rise again at once drop on to her knee and at the same instant she be terrorstricken at what she be do " where be I what be I do what for " she try to get up to drop backwards but something huge and merciless strike she on the head and roll she on her back " lord forgive I all " she say feel it impossible to struggle a peasant mutter something be work at the iron above she and the light by which she have read the book fill with trouble falsehood sorrow and evil flare up more brightly than ever before light up for she all that have be in darkness flicker begin to grow dim and be quench forever       chapter 1    almost two month have pass the hot summer be half over but sergey ivanovitch be only just prepare to leave moscow   sergey ivanovitch ’s life have not be uneventful during this time a year ago he have finish his book the fruit of six year ' labor " sketch of a survey of the principle and form of government in europe and russia " several section of this book and its introduction have appear in periodical publication and other part have be read by sergey ivanovitch to person of his circle so that the lead idea of the work could not be completely novel to the public but still sergey ivanovitch have expect that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society and if it do not cause a revolution in social science it would at any rate make a great stir in the scientific world   after the most conscientious revision the book have last year be publish and have be distribute among the bookseller   though he ask no one about it reluctantly and with feigned indifference answer his friend ' inquiry as to how the book be go and do not even inquire of the bookseller how the book be sell sergey ivanovitch be all on the alert with strained attention watch for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature   but a week pass a second a third and in society no impression whatever could be detect his friend who be specialist and savant occasionally — unmistakably from politeness — allude to it the rest of his acquaintance not interested in a book on a learned subject do not talk of it at all and society generally — just now especially absorb in other thing — be absolutely indifferent in the press too for a whole month there be not a word about his book   sergey ivanovitch have calculate to a nicety the time necessary for write a review but a month pass and a second and still there be silence   only in the northern beetle in a comic article on the singer drabanti who have lose his voice there be a contemptuous allusion to koznishev ’s book suggest that the book have be long ago see through by everyone and be a subject of general ridicule   at last in the third month a critical article appear in a serious review sergey ivanovitch know the author of the article he have meet he once at golubtsov ’s   the author of the article be a young man an invalid very bold as a writer but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relation   in spite of his absolute contempt for the author it be with complete respect that sergey ivanovitch set about read the article the article be awful   the critic have undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it but he have select quotation so adroitly that for people who have not read the book and obviously scarcely anyone have read it it seem absolutely clear that the whole book be nothing but a medley of highflown phrase not even — as suggest by mark of interrogation — use appropriately and that the author of the book be a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject and all this be so wittily do that sergey ivanovitch would not have disown such wit himself but that be just what be so awful   in spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which sergey ivanovitch verify the correctness of the critic ’s argument he do not for a minute stop to ponder over the fault and mistake which be ridicule but unconsciously he begin immediately try to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article   " do not I offend he in some way " sergey ivanovitch wonder   and remember that when they meet he have correct the young man about something he have say that betray ignorance sergey ivanovitch find the clue to explain the article   this article be follow by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation and sergey ivanovitch see that his six year ' task toil at with such love and labor have go leave no trace   sergey ivanovitch ’s position be still more difficult from the fact that since he have finish his book he have have no more literary work to do such as have hitherto occupy the great part of his time   sergey ivanovitch be clever cultivated healthy and energetic and he do not know what use to make of his energy conversation in drawingroom in meeting assembly and committee — everywhere where talk be possible — take up part of his time but be use for year to town life he do not waste all his energy in talk as his less experience young brother do when he be in moscow he have a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of   fortunately for he at this period so difficult for he from the failure of his book the various public question of the dissent sect of the american alliance of the samara famine of exhibition and of spiritualism be definitely replace in public interest by the slavonic question which have hitherto rather languidly interest society and sergey ivanovitch who have be one of the first to raise this subject throw himself into it heart and soul   in the circle to which sergey ivanovitch belong nothing be talk of or write about just now but the servian war everything that the idle crowd usually do to kill time be do now for the benefit of the slavonic state ball concert dinner matchbox lady ' dress beer restaurant — everything testify to sympathy with the slavonic people   from much of what be speak and write on the subject sergey ivanovitch differ on various point he see that the slavonic question have become one of those fashionable distraction which succeed one another in provide society with an object and an occupation he see too that a great many people be take up the subject from motive of selfinterest and selfadvertisement he recognize that the newspaper publish a great deal that be superfluous and exaggerated with the sole aim of attract attention and outbid one another he see that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shout the loudest be man who have fail and be smart under a sense of injury — general without army minister not in the ministry journalist not on any paper party leader without follower he see that there be a great deal in it that be frivolous and absurd but he see and recognize an unmistakable grow enthusiasm unite all class with which it be impossible not to sympathize the massacre of man who be fellow christians and of the same slavonic race excite sympathy for the sufferer and indignation against the oppressor and the heroism of the servians and montenegrins struggle for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brother not in word but in deed   but in this there be another aspect that rejoice sergey ivanovitch that be the manifestation of public opinion the public have definitely express its desire the soul of the people have as sergey ivanovitch say find expression and the more he work in this cause the more incontestable it seem to he that it be a cause destine to assume vast dimension to create an epoch   he throw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause and forget to think about his book his whole time now be engross by it so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letter and appeal address to he he work the whole spring and part of the summer and it be only in july that he prepare to go away to his brother ’s in the country   he be go both to rest for a fortnight and in the very heart of the people in the farth wild of the country to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people of which like all resident in the capital and big town he be fully persuade katavasov have long be mean to carry out his promise to stay with levin and so he be go with he   chapter 2   sergey ivanovitch and katavasov have only just reach the station of the kursk line which be particularly busy and full of people that day when look round for the groom who be follow with their thing they see a party of volunteer drive up in four cab lady meet they with bouquet of flower and follow by the rush crowd they go into the station   one of the lady who have meet the volunteer come out of the hall and address sergey ivanovitch   " you too come to see they off " she ask in french   " no I ’m go away myself princess to my brother ’s for a holiday do you always see they off " say sergey ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile   " oh that would be impossible " answer the princess " be it true that eight hundred have be send from we already malvinsky would not believe I "   " more than eight hundred if you reckon those who have be send not directly from moscow over a thousand " answer sergey ivanovitch   " there that ’ just what I say " exclaim the lady " and it ’ true too I suppose that more than a million have be subscribe "   " yes princess "   "

 vronsky be frown and look straight before he as though he do not hear what stepan arkadyevitch be say   probably on oblonsky ’s point they out he look round in the direction where the princess and sergey ivanovitch be stand and without speak lift his hat his face age and wear by suffering look stony   go onto the platform vronsky leave his mother and disappear into a compartment   on the platform there ring out " god save the tsar " then shout of " hurrah " and " jivio " one of the volunteer a tall very young man with a hollow chest be particularly conspicuous bow and wave his felt hat and a nosegay over his head then two officer emerge bow too and a stout man with a big beard wear a greasy forage cap     say goodbye to the princess sergey ivanovitch be join by katavasov together they get into a carriage full to overflowing and the train start   at tsaritsino station the train be meet by a chorus of young man singe " hail to thee " again the volunteer bow and poke their head out but sergey ivanovitch pay no attention to they he have have so much to do with the volunteer that the type be familiar to he and do not interest he katavasov whose scientific work have prevent his have a chance of observe they hitherto be very much interested in they and question sergey ivanovitch   sergey ivanovitch advise he to go into the secondclass and talk to they himself at the next station katavasov act on this suggestion   at the first stop he move into the secondclass and make the acquaintance of the volunteer they be sit in a corner of the carriage talk loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passenger and katavasov as he get in be concentrate upon they more loudly than all talk the tall hollowchested young man he be unmistakably tipsy and be relate some story that have occur at his school face he sit a middleaged officer in the austrian military jacket of the guards uniform he be listen with a smile to the hollowchested youth and occasionally pull he up the third in an artillery uniform be sit on a box beside they a fourth be asleep   enter into conversation with the youth katavasov learn that he be a wealthy moscow merchant who have run through a large fortune before he be twoandtwenty katavasov do not like he because he be unmanly and effeminate and sickly he be obviously convince especially now after drink that he be perform a heroic action and he brag of it in the most unpleasant way   the second the retire officer make an unpleasant impression too upon katavasov he be it seem a man who have try everything he have be on a railway have be a landsteward and have start factory and he talk quite without necessity of all he have do and use learned expression quite inappropriately   the third the artilleryman on the contrary strike katavasov very favorably he be a quiet modest fellow unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic selfsacrifice of the merchant and say nothing about himself when katavasov ask he what have impel he to go to servia he answer modestly   " oh well everyone ’ go the servians want help too I ’m sorry for they "   " yes you artilleryman especially be scarce there " say katavasov   " oh I be not long in the artillery maybe they ’ll put I into the infantry or the cavalry "   " into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything " say katavasov fancy from the artilleryman ’s apparent age that he must have reach a fairly high grade   " I be not long in the artillery I ’m a cadet retire " he say and he begin to explain how he have fail in his examination   all of this together make a disagreeable impression on katavasov and when the volunteer get out at a station for a drink katavasov would have like to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone there be an old man in the carriage wear a military overcoat who have be listen all the while to katavasov ’s conversation with the volunteer when they be leave alone katavasov address he   " what different position they come from all those fellow who be go off there " katavasov say vaguely not wish to express his own opinion and at the same time anxious to find out the old man ’s view   the old man be an officer who have serve on two campaign he know what make a soldier and judge by the appearance and the talk of those person by the swagger with which they have recourse to the bottle on the journey he consider they poor soldier moreover he live in a district town and he be long to tell how one soldier have volunteer from his town a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer but know by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it be dangerous to express an opinion oppose to the general one and especially to criticize the volunteer unfavorably he too watch katavasov without commit himself   " well man be want there " he say laugh with his eye and they fall to talk of the last war news and each conceal from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expect next day since the turk have be beat accord to the late news at all point and so they part neither give expression to his opinion   katavasov go back to his own carriage and with reluctant hypocrisy report to sergey ivanovitch his observation of the volunteer from which it would appear that they be capital fellow   at a big station at a town the volunteer be again greet with shout and singing again man and woman with collect box appear and provincial lady bring bouquet to the volunteer and follow they into the refreshment room but all this be on a much small and feeble scale than in moscow     while the train be stop at the provincial town sergey ivanovitch do not go to the refreshment room but walk up and down the platform   the first time he pass vronsky ’s compartment he notice that the curtain be draw over the window but as he pass it the second time he see the old countess at the window she beckon to koznishev   " I ’m go you see take he as far as kursk " she say   " yes so I hear " say sergey ivanovitch stand at her window and peep in " what a noble act on his part " he add notice that vronsky be not in the compartment   " yes after his misfortune what be there for he to do "   " what a terrible thing it be " say sergey ivanovitch   " ah what I have be through but do get in ah what I have be through " she repeat when sergey ivanovitch have get in and sit down beside she " you can not conceive it for six week he do not speak to anyone and would not touch food except when I implore he and not for one minute could we leave he alone we take away everything he could have use against himself we live on the ground floor but there be no reckoning on anything you know of course that he have shoot himself once already on her account " she say and the old lady ’s eyelash twitch at the recollection " yes hers be the fitting end for such a woman even the death she choose be low and vulgar "   " it ’ not for we to judge countess " say sergey ivanovitch " but I can understand that it have be very hard for you "   " ah do not speak of it I be stay on my estate and he be with I a note be bring he he write an answer and send it off we have not an idea that she be close by at the station in the evening I have only just go to my room when my mary tell I a lady have throw herself under the train

complète the doctor say and that be follow almost by madness oh why talk of it " say the countess with a wave of her hand " it be an awful time no say what you will she be a bad woman why what be the meaning of such desperate passion it be all to show herself something out of the way well and that she do do she bring herself to ruin and two good man — her husband and my unhappy son "   " and what do her husband do " ask sergey ivanovitch   " he have take her daughter alexey be ready to agree to anything at first now it worry he terribly that he should have give his own child away to another

of no religious feeling god forgive I but I can not help hate the memory of she when I look at my son ’s misery "   " but how be he now "   " it be a blessing from providence for we — this servian war I ’m old and I do not understand the right and wrong of it but it ’ come as a providential blessing to he of course for I as his mother it ’ terrible and what ’ bad they say ce n’est pas très bien vu

now it ’ an interest for he do please talk to he a little I want to distract his mind he ’ so lowspirited and as bad luck would have it he have toothache too but he ’ll be delighted to see you please do talk to he he ’ walk up and down on that side "   sergey ivanovitch say he would be very glad to and cross over to the other side of the station     in the slant evening shadow cast by the baggage pile up on the platform vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat with his hand in his pocket stride up and down like a wild beast in a cage turn sharply after twenty pace sergey ivanovitch fancy as he approach he that vronsky see he but be pretend not to see this do not affect sergey ivanovitch in the slight he be above all personal consideration with vronsky   at that moment sergey ivanovitch look upon vronsky as a man take an important part in a great cause and koznishev think it his duty to encourage he and express his approval he go up to he   vronsky stand still look intently at he recognize he and go a few step forward to meet he shake hand with he very warmly   " possibly you do not wish to see I " say sergey ivanovitch " but could not I be of use to you "   " there ’ no one I should less dislike see than you " say vronsky " excuse I and there ’ nothing in life for I to like "   " I quite understand and I merely mean to offer you my service " say sergey ivanovitch scan vronsky ’s face full of unmistakable suffering " would not it be of use to you to have a letter to ristitch — to milan "   " oh no " vronsky say seem to understand he with difficulty " if you do not mind let ’s walk on it ’ so stuffy among the carriage a letter no thank you to meet death one need no letter of introduction nor for the turk " he say with a smile that be merely of the lip his eye still keep their look of angry suffering   " yes but you might find it easy to get into relation which be after all essential with anyone prepare to see you but that ’ as you like I be very glad to hear of your intention there have be so many attack make on the volunteer and a man like you raise they in public estimation "   " my use as a man " say vronsky " be that life ’ worth nothing to I and that I ’ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their rank and to trample on they or fall — I know that I ’m glad there ’ something to give my life for for it ’ not simply useless but loathsome to I anyone ’s welcome to it " and his jaw twitch impatiently from the incessant gnaw toothache that prevent he from even speak with a natural expression   " you will become another man I predict " say sergey ivanovitch feel touch " to deliver one ’s brotherman from bondage be an aim worth death and life god grant you success outwardly — and inwardly peace " he add and he hold out his hand vronsky warmly press his outstretched hand   " yes as a weapon I may be of some use but as a man I ’m a wreck " he jerk out   he could hardly speak for the throb ache in his strong tooth that be like row of ivory in his mouth he be silent and his eye rest on the wheel of the tender slowly and smoothly roll along the rail   and all at once a different pain not an ache but an inner trouble that set his whole being in anguish make he for an instant forget his toothache as he glance at the tender and the rail under the influence of the conversation with a friend he have not meet since his misfortune he suddenly recall she — that be what be leave of she when he have run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station — on the table shamelessly sprawl out among stranger the bloodstained body so lately full of life the head unhurt drop back with its weight of hair and the curl tress about the temple and the exquisite face with red halfopened mouth the strange fixed expression piteous on the lip and awful in the still open eye that seem to utter that fearful phrase — that he would be sorry for it — that she have say when they be quarrel   and he try to think of she as she be when he meet she the first time at a railway station too mysterious exquisite loving seeking and give happiness and not cruelly revengeful as he remember she on that last moment he try to recall his good moment with she but those moment be poison forever he could only think of she as triumphant successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be efface he lose all consciousness of toothache and his face work with sob   pass twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regain his selfpossession he address sergey ivanovitch calmly   " you have have no telegram since yesterday ’ yes drive back for a third time but a decisive engagement expect for tomorrow "   and after talk a little more of king milan ’s proclamation and the immense effect it might have they part go to their carriage on hear the second bell     sergey ivanovitch have not telegraph to his brother to send to meet he as he do not know when he should be able to leave moscow levin be not at home when katavasov and sergey ivanovitch in a fly hire at the station drive up to the step of the pokrovskoe house as black as moor from the dust of the road kitty sit on the balcony with her father and sister recognize her brotherinlaw and run down to meet he   " what a shame not to have let we know " she say give her hand to sergey ivanovitch and put her forehead up for he to kiss   " we

breathless screaming and vain sucking thing go right and mother and child feel simultaneously soothed and both subside into calm   " but poor darling he ’ all in perspiration " say kitty in a whisper touch the baby   " what make you think he know you " she add with a sidelong glance at the baby ’s eye that peer roguishly as she fancy from under his cap at his rhythmically puff cheek and the little redpalmed hand he be wave   " impossible if he know anyone he would have know I " say kitty in response to agafea mihalovna ’s statement and she smile   she smile because though she say he could not

be if god would send a drop of rain " she say   " yes yes sh — sh — sh — — " be all kitty answer rock a little and tenderly squeeze the plump little arm with roll of fat at the wrist which mitya still wave feebly as he open and shut his eye that hand worried kitty she long to kiss the little hand but be afraid to for fear of wake the baby at last the little hand cease wave and the eye close only from time to time as he go on suck the baby raise his long curly eyelash and peep at his mother with wet eye that look black in the twilight the nurse have leave off fan and be doze from above come the peal of the old prince ’s voice and the chuckle of katavasov   " they have get into talk without I " think kitty " but still it ’ vexing that kostya ’ out he ’ sure to have go to the beehouse again though it ’ a pity he ’ there so often still I ’m glad it distract his mind he ’ become altogether happy and well now than in the spring he use to be so gloomy and worried that I feel frightened for he and how absurd he be " she whisper smile   she know what worry her husband it be his unbelief although if she have be ask whether she suppose that in the future life if he do not believe he would be damn she would have have to admit that he would be damn his unbelief do not cause she unhappiness and she confess that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation and love her husband ’s soul more than anything in the world think with a smile of his unbelief and tell herself that he be absurd   " what do he keep read philosophy of some sort for all this year " she wonder " if it ’ all write in those book he can understand they if it ’ all wrong why do he read they he say himself that he would like to believe then why be it he do not believe surely from his thinking so much and he think so much from be solitary he ’ always alone alone he can not talk about it all to we I fancy he ’ll be glad of these visitor especially katavasov he like discussion with they " she think and pass instantly to the consideration of where it would be more convenient to put katavasov to sleep alone or to share sergey ivanovitch ’s room and then an idea suddenly strike she which make she shudder and even disturb mitya who glance severely at she " I do believe the laundress have not send the washing yet and all the good sheet be in use if I do not see to it agafea mihalovna will give sergey ivanovitch the wrong sheet " and at the very idea of this the blood rush to kitty ’s face   " yes I will arrange it " she decide and go back to her former thought she remember that some spiritual question of importance have be interrupt and she begin to recall what " yes kostya an unbeliever " she think again with a smile   " well an unbeliever then well let he always be one than like madame stahl or what I try to be in those day abroad no he will not ever sham anything "   and a recent instance of his goodness rise vividly to her mind a fortnight ago a penitent letter have come from stepan arkadyevitch to dolly he beseech she to save his honor to sell her estate to pay his debt dolly be in despair she detest her husband despise he pity he resolve on a separation resolve to refuse but end by agree to sell part of her property after that with an irrepressible smile of tenderness kitty recall her husband ’s shamefaced embarrassment his repeat awkward effort to approach the subject and how at last have think of the one means of help dolly without wound her pride he have suggest to kitty — what have not occur to she before — that she should give up her share of the property   " he an unbeliever indeed with his heart his dread of offend anyone even a child everything for other nothing for himself sergey ivanovitch simply consider it as kostya ’s duty to be his steward and it ’ the same with his sister now dolly and her child be under his guardianship all these peasant who come to he every day as though he be bind to be at their service "   " yes only be like your father only like he " she say hand mitya over to the nurse and put her lip to his cheek   chapter 8   ever since by his beloved brother ’s deathbed levin have first glance into the question of life and death in the light of these new conviction as he call they which have during the period from his twentieth to his thirtyfourth year imperceptibly replace his childish and youthful belief — he have be stricken with horror not so much of death as of life without any knowledge of whence and why and how and what it be the physical organization its decay the indestructibility of matter the law of the conservation of energy evolution be the word which usurp the place of his old belief these word and the idea associate with they be very well for intellectual purpose but for life they yield nothing and levin feel suddenly like a man who have change his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment and go for the first time into the frost be immediately convince not by reason but by his whole nature that he be as good as naked and that he must infallibly perish miserably   from that moment though he do not distinctly face it and still go on live as before levin have never lose this sense of terror at his lack of knowledge   he vaguely feel too that what he call his new conviction be not merely lack of knowledge but that they be part of a whole order of idea in which no knowledge of what he need be possible   at first marriage with the new joy and duty bind up with it have completely crowd out these thought but of late while he be stay in moscow after his wife ’s confinement with nothing to do the question that clamor for solution have more and more often more and more insistently haunt levin ’s mind   the question be sum up for he thus " if I do not accept the answer christianity give to the problem of my life what answer do I accept " and in the whole arsenal of his conviction so far from find any satisfactory answer he be utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer   he be in the position of a man seek food in toy shop and tool shop   instinctively unconsciously with every book with every conversation with every man he meet he be on the lookout for light on these question and their solution   what puzzle and distract he above everything be that the majority of man of his age and circle have like he exchange their old belief for the same new conviction and yet see nothing to lament in this and be perfectly satisfied and serene so that apart from the principal question levin be torture by other question too be these people sincere he ask himself or be they play a part or be it that they understand the answer science give to these problem in some different clear sense than he do and he assiduously study both these man ’s opinion and the book which treat of these scientific explanation   one fact he have find out since these question have engross his mind be that he have be quite wrong in suppose from the recollection of the circle of his young day at college that religion have outlive its day and that it be now practically nonexistent all the people near to he who be good in their life be believer the old prince and lvov whom he like so much and sergey ivanovitch and all the woman believe and his wife believe as simply as he have believe in his early childhood and ninetynine hundredth of the russian people all the work people for whose life he feel the deep respect believe   another fact of which he become convinced after read many scientific book be that the man who share his view have no other construction to put on they and that they give no explanation of the question which he feel he could not live without answer but simply ignore their existence and attempt to explain other question of no possible interest to he such as the evolution of organism the materialistic theory of consciousness and so forth   moreover during his wife ’s confinement something have happen that seem extraordinary to he he an unbeliever have fall into pray and at the moment he pray he believe but that moment have pass and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his life   he could not admit that at that moment he know the truth and that now he be wrong for as soon as he begin think calmly about it it all fall to piece he could not admit that he be mistake then for his spiritual condition then be precious to he and to admit that it be a proof of weakness would have be to desecrate those moment he be miserably divide against himself and strain all his spiritual force to the utmost to escape from this condition   chapter 9   these doubt fret and harass he grow weak or strong from time to time but never leave he he read and think and the more he read and the more he think the far he feel from the aim he be pursue   of late in moscow and in the country since he have become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialist he have read and reread thoroughly plato spinoza kant schelling hegel and schopenhauer the philosopher who give a nonmaterialistic explanation of life   their idea seem to he fruitful when he be read or be himself seek argument to refute other theory especially those of the materialist but as soon as he begin to read or seek for himself a solution of problem the same thing always happen as long as he follow the fixed definition of obscure word such as spirit will freedom essence purposely let himself go into the snare of word the philosopher set for he he seem to comprehend something but he have only to forget the artificial train of reasoning and to turn from life itself to what have satisfy he while think in accordance with the fix definition and all this artificial edifice fall to piece at once like a house of card and it become clear that the edifice have be build up out of those transpose word apart from anything in life more important than reason   at one time read schopenhauer he put in place of his will the word love and for a couple of day this new philosophy charm he till he remove a little away from it but then when he turn from life itself to glance at it again it fall away too and prove to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it   his brother sergey ivanovitch advise he to read the theological work of homiakov levin read the second volume of homiakov ’s work and in spite of the elegant epigrammatic argumentative style which at first repel he he be impress by the doctrine of the church he find in they he be strike at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truth have not be vouchsafe to man but to a corporation of man bind together by love — to the church what delight he be the thought how much easy it be to believe in a still exist live church embrace all the belief of man and have god at its head and therefore holy and infallible and from it to accept the faith in god in the creation the fall the redemption than to begin with god a mysterious faraway god the creation etc but afterwards on read a catholic writer ’s history of the church and then a greek orthodox writer ’s history of the church and see that the two church in their very conception infallible each deny the authority of the other homiakov ’s doctrine of the church lose all its charm for he and this edifice crumble into dust like the philosopher ' edifice   all that spring he be not himself and go through fearful moment of horror   " without know what I be and why I be here life ’ impossible and that I can not know and so I can not live " levin say to himself   " in infinite time in infinite matter in infinite space be form a bubbleorganism and that bubble last a while and burst and that bubble be I "   it be an agonizing error but it be the sole logical result of age of human thought in that direction   this be the ultimate belief on which all the system elaborate by human thought in almost all their ramification rest it be the prevalent conviction and of all other explanation levin have unconsciously not know when or how choose it as anyway the clear and make it his own   but it be not merely a falsehood it be the cruel jeer of some wicked power some evil hateful power to whom one could not submit   he must escape from this power and the mean of escape every man have in his own hand he have but to cut short this dependence on evil and there be one means — death   and levin a happy father and husband in perfect health be several time so near suicide that he hide the cord that he might not be tempt to hang himself and be afraid to go out with his gun for fear of shoot himself   but levin do not shoot himself and do not hang himself he go on live     when levin think what he be and what he be live for he could find no answer to the question and be reduce to despair but he leave off question himself about it it seem as though he know both what he be and for what he be live for he act and live resolutely and without hesitation indeed in these latter day he be far more decided and unhesitating in life than he have ever be   when he go back to the country at the beginning of june he go back also to his usual pursuit the management of the estate his relation with the peasant and the neighbor the care of his household the management of his sister ’s and brother ’s property of which he have the direction his relation with his wife and kindred the care of his child and the new beekeeping hobby he have take up that spring fill all his time   these thing occupy he now not because he justify they to himself by any sort of general principle as he have do in former day on the contrary disappoint by the failure of his former effort for the general welfare and too much occupy with his own thought and the mass of business with which he be burden from all side he have completely give up thinking of the general good and he busy himself with all this work simply because it seem to he that he must do what he be do — that he could not do otherwise in former day — almost from childhood and increasingly up to full manhood — when he have try to do anything that would be good for all for humanity for russia for the whole village he have notice that the idea of it have be pleasant but the work itself have always be incoherent that then he have never have a full conviction of its absolute necessity and that the work that have begin by seem so great have grow less and less till it vanish into nothing but now since his marriage when he have begin to confine himself more and more to live for himself though he experience no delight at all at the thought of the work he be do he feel a complete conviction of its necessity see that it succeed far well than in old day and that it keep on grow more and more   now involuntarily it seem he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough so that he could not be draw out without turn aside the furrow   to live the same family life as his father and forefather — that be in the same condition of culture — and to bring up his child in the same be incontestably necessary it be as necessary as dining when one be hungry and to do this just as it be necessary to cook dinner it be necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at pokrovskoe go so as to yield an income just as incontestably as it be necessary to repay a debt be it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son when he receive it as a heritage would say " thank you " to his father as levin have say " thank you " to his grandfather for all he build and plant and to do this it be necessary to look after the land himself not to let it and to breed cattle manure the field and plant timber   it be impossible not to look after the affair of sergey ivanovitch of his sister of the peasant who come to he for advice and be accustomed to do so — as impossible as to fling down a child one be carry in one ’s arm it be necessary to look after the comfort of his sisterinlaw and her child and of his wife and baby and it be impossible not to spend with they at least a short time each day   and all this together with shooting and his new beekeeping fill up the whole of levin ’s life which have no meaning at all for he when he begin to think   but besides know thoroughly what he have to do levin know in just the same way how he have to do it all and what be more important than the rest   he know he must hire laborer as cheaply as possible but to hire man under bond pay they in advance at less than the current rate of wage be what he must not do even though it be very profitable sell straw to the peasant in time of scarcity of provender be what he might do even though he feel sorry for they but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down though they be a source of income fell timber must be punish as severely as possible but he could not exact forfeit for cattle be drive onto his field and though it annoy the keeper and make the peasant not afraid to graze their cattle on his land he could not keep their cattle as a punishment   to pyotr who be pay a moneylender ten per cent a month he must lend a sum of money to set he free but he could not let off peasant who do not pay their rent nor let they fall into arrear it be impossible to overlook the bailiff ’s not have mow the meadow and let the hay spoil and it be equally impossible to mow those acre where a young copse have be plant it be impossible to excuse a laborer who have go home in the busy season because his father be die however sorry he might feel for he and he must subtract from his pay those costly month of idleness but it be impossible not to allow monthly ration to the old servant who be of no use for anything   levin know that when he get home he must first of all go to his wife who be unwell and that the peasant who have be wait for three hour to see he could wait a little long he know too that regardless of all the pleasure he feel in take a swarm he must forego that pleasure and leave the old man to see to the bee alone while he talk to the peasant who have come after he to the beehouse   whether he be act rightly or wrongly he do not know and far from try to prove that he be nowadays he avoid all thought or talk about it   reasoning have bring he to doubt and prevent he from see what he ought to do and what he ought not when he do not think but simply live he be continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul determine which of two possible course of action be the well and which be the bad and as soon as he do not act rightly he be at once aware of it   so he live not know and not see any chance of know what he be and what he be live for and harass at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he be afraid of suicide and yet firmly lay down his own individual definite path in life     the day on which sergey ivanovitch come to pokrovskoe be one of levin ’s most painful day it be the very busy working time when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of selfsacrifice in labor such as be never show in any other condition of life and would be highly esteem if the man who show these quality themselves think highly of they and if it be not repeat every year and if the result of this intense labor be not so simple   to reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it to mow the meadow turn over the fallow thrash the seed and sow the winter corn — all this seem so simple and ordinary but to succeed in get through it all everyone in the village from the old man to the young child must toil incessantly for three or four week three time as hard as usual live on ryebeer onion and black bread thrash and carry the sheaf at night and not give more than two or three hour in the twentyfour to sleep and every year this be do all over russia   have live the great part of his life in the country and in the close relation with the peasant levin always feel in this busy time that he be infect by this general quickening of energy in the people   in the early morning he ride over to the first sowing of the rye and to the oats which be be carry to the stack and return home at the time his wife and sisterinlaw be get up he drink coffee with they and walk to the farm where a new thrash machine be to be set work to get ready the seedcorn   he be stand in the cool granary still fragrant with the leave of the hazel branch interlace on the freshly peel aspen beam of the new thatch roof he gaze through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrash whirl and play at the grass of the thrash floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that have be bring in from the barn then at the specklyheaded whitebreasted swallow that fly chirp in under the roof and flutter their wing settle in the crevice of the doorway then at the peasant bustle in the dark dusty barn and he think strange thought   " why be it all be do " he think " why be I stand here make they work what be you all so busy for try to show their zeal before I what be that old matrona my old friend toil for I doctor she when the beam fall on she in the fire " he think look at a thin old woman who be rake up the grain move painfully with her bare sunblackened foot over the uneven rough floor " then she recover but today or tomorrow or in ten year she will not they ’ll bury she and nothing will be leave either of she or of that smart girl in the red jacket who with that skillful soft action shake the ear out of their husk they ’ll bury she and this piebald horse and very soon too " he think gaze at the heavily move pant horse that keep walk up the wheel that turn under he " and they will bury she and fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt tear on his white shoulder — they will bury he he ’ untie the sheaf and give order and shout to the woman and quickly set straight the strap on the move wheel and what ’ more it ’ not they alone — I they ’ll bury too and nothing will be leave what for "   he think this and at the same time look at his watch to reckon how much they thrash in an hour he want to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day   " it ’ll soon be one and they ’re only begin the third sheaf " think levin he go up to the man that be feed the machine and shout over the roar of the machine he tell he to put it in more slowly " you put in too much at a time fyodor do you see — it get choke that ’ why it be not get on do it evenly "   fyodor black with the dust that cling to his moist face shout something in response but still go on do it as levin do not want he to   levin go up to the machine move fyodor aside and begin feed the corn in himself work on till the peasant ' dinner hour which be not long in come he go out of the barn with fyodor and fall into talk with he stop beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye lay on the thrash floor for seed   fyodor come from a village at some distance from the one in which levin have once allot land to his cooperative association now it have be let to a former house porter   levin talk to fyodor about this land and ask whether platon a welltodo peasant of good character belong to the same village would not take the land for the come year   " it ’ a high rent it would not pay platon konstantin dmitrievitch " answer the peasant pick the ear off his sweatdrenched shirt   " but how do kirillov make it pay "   " mituh " so the peasant call the house porter in a tone of contempt " you may be sure he ’ll make it pay konstantin dmitrievitch he ’ll get his share however he have to squeeze to get it he ’ no mercy on a christian but uncle fokanitch " so he call the old peasant platon " do you suppose he ’d flay the skin off a man where there ’ debt he ’ll let anyone off and he ’ll not wring the last penny out he ’ a man too "   " but why will he let anyone off "   " oh well of course folk be different one man live for his own want and nothing else like mituh he only think of fill his belly but fokanitch be a righteous man he live for his soul he do not forget god "   " how think of god how do he live for his soul " levin almost shout   " why to be sure in truth in god ’s way folk be different take you now you would not wrong a man "   " yes yes goodbye " say levin breathless with excitement and turn round he take his stick and walk quickly away towards home at the peasant ’s word that fokanitch live for his soul in truth in god ’s way undefined but significant idea seem to burst out as though they have be lock up and all strive towards one goal they throng whirl through his head blind he with their light     levin stride along the highroad absorb not so much in his thought he could not yet disentangle they as in his spiritual condition unlike anything he have experience before   the word utter by the peasant have act on his soul like an electric shock suddenly transform and combine into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed impotent separate thought that incessantly occupy his mind these thought have unconsciously be in his mind even when he be talk about the land   he be aware of something new in his soul and joyfully test this new thing not yet know what it be   " not live for his own want but for god for what god and could one say anything more senseless than what he say he say that one must not live for one ’s own want that be that one must not live for what we understand what we be attract by what we desire but must live for something incomprehensible for god whom no one can understand nor even define what of it do not I understand those senseless word of fyodor ’s and understand they do I doubt of their truth do I think they stupid obscure inexact no I understand he and exactly as he understand the word I understand they more fully and clearly than I understand anything in life and never in my life have I doubt nor can I doubt about it and not only I but everyone the whole world understand nothing fully but this and about this only they have no doubt and be always agree   " and I look out for miracle complain that I do not see a miracle which would convince I a material miracle would have persuade I and here be a miracle the sole miracle possible continually exist surround I on all side and I never notice it   " fyodor say that kirillov live for his belly that ’ comprehensible and rational all of we as rational being can not do anything else but live for our belly and all of a sudden the same fyodor say that one must not live for one ’s belly but must live for truth for god and at a hint I understand he and I and million of man man who live age ago and man live now — peasant the poor in spirit and the learned who have think and write about it in their obscure word say the same thing — we be all agree about this one thing what we must live for and what be good I and all man have only one firm incontestable clear knowledge and that knowledge can not be explain by the reason — it be outside it and have no cause and can have no effect   " if goodness have cause it be not goodness if it have effect a reward it be not goodness either so goodness be outside the chain of cause and effect   " and yet I know it and we all know it   " what could be a great miracle than that   " can I have find the solution of it all can my suffering be over " think levin stride along the dusty road not notice the heat nor his weariness and experience a sense of relief from prolong suffering this feeling be so delicious that it seem to he incredible he be breathless with emotion and incapable of go far he turn off the road into the forest and lie down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass he take his hat off his hot head and lie prop on his elbow in the lush feathery woodland grass   " yes I must make it clear to myself and understand " he think look intently at the untrampled grass before he and follow the movement of a green beetle advance along a blade of couchgrass and lift up in its progress a leaf of goatweed " what have I discover " he ask himself bend aside the leaf of goatweed out of the beetle ’s way and twist another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it " what be it make I glad what have I discover   " I have discover nothing I have only find out what I know I understand the force that in the past give I life and now too give I life I have be set free from falsity I have find the master   " of old I use to say that in my body that in the body of this grass and of this beetle there she do not care for the grass she ’ open her wing and fly away there be go on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical chemical and physiological law and in all of we as well as in the aspen and the cloud and the misty patch there be a process of evolution evolution from what into what — eternal evolution and struggle as though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal and I be astonish that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not discover the meaning of life the meaning of my impulse and yearning now I say that I know the meaning of my life ' to live for god for my soul ' and this meaning in spite of its clearness be mysterious and marvelous such indeed be the meaning of everything exist yes pride " he say to himself turn over on his stomach and begin to tie a noose of blade of grass try not to break they   " and not merely pride of intellect but dulness of intellect and most of all the deceitfulness yes the deceitfulness of intellect the cheating knavishness of intellect that ’ it " he say to himself   and he briefly go through mentally the whole course of his idea during the last two year the beginning of which be the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill   then for the first time grasp that for every man and himself too there be nothing in store but suffer death and forgetfulness he have make up his mind that life be impossible like that and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to he as the evil jest of some devil or shoot himself   but he have not do either but have go on live thinking and feeling and have even at that very time marry and have have many joy and have be happy when he be not think of the meaning of his life   what do this mean it mean that he have be live rightly but think wrongly   he have live without be aware of it on those spiritual truth that he have suck in with his mother ’s milk but he have think not merely without recognition of these truth but studiously ignore they   now it be clear to he that he could only live by virtue of the belief in which he have be bring up   " what should I have be and how should I have spend my life if I have not have these belief if I have not know that I must live for god and not for my own desire I should have rob and lie and kill nothing of what make the chief happiness of my life would have exist for I " and with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have be himself if he have not know what he be live for   " I look for an answer to my question and think could not give an answer to my question — it be incommensurable with my question the answer have be give I by life itself in my knowledge of what be right and what be wrong and that knowledge I do not arrive at in any way it be give to I as to all man give because I could not have get it from anywhere   " where could I have get it by reason could I have arrive at know that I must love my neighbor and not oppress he I be tell that in my childhood and I believe it gladly for they tell I what be already in my soul but who discover it not reason reason discover the struggle for existence and the law that require we to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desire that be the deduction of reason but love one ’s neighbor reason could never discover because it ’ irrational "   chapter 13   and levin remember a scene he have lately witness between dolly and her child the child leave to themselves have begin cook raspberry over the candle and squirt milk into each other ’s mouth with a syringe their mother catch they at these prank begin remind they in levin ’s presence of the trouble their mischief give to the grownup people and that this trouble be all for their sake and that if they smash the cup they would have nothing to drink their tea out of and that if they waste the milk they would have nothing to eat and die of hunger   and levin have be strike by the passive weary incredulity with which the child hear what their mother say to they they be simply annoyed that their amusing play have be interrupt and do not believe a word of what their mother be say they could not believe it indeed for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoy and so could not conceive that what they be destroy be the very thing they live by   " that all come of itself " they think " and there ’ nothing interesting or important about it because it have always be so and always will be so and it ’ all always the same we ’ve no need to think about that it ’ all ready but we want to invent something of our own and new so we think of put raspberry in a cup and cook they over a candle and squirt milk straight into each other ’s mouth that ’ fun and something new and not a bit bad than drink out of cup "   " be not it just the same that we do that I do search by the aid of reason for the significance of the force of nature and the meaning of the life of man " he think   " and do not all the theory of philosophy do the same trying by the path of thought which be strange and not natural to man to bring he to a knowledge of what he have know long ago and know so certainly that he could not live at all without it be not it distinctly to be see in the development of each philosopher ’s theory that he know what be the chief significance of life beforehand just as positively as the peasant fyodor and not a bit more clearly than he and be simply try by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone know   " now then leave the child to themselves to get thing alone and make their crockery get the milk from the cow and so on would they be naughty then why they ’d die of hunger well then leave we with our passion and thought without any idea of the one god of the creator or without any idea of what be right without any idea of moral evil   " just try and build up anything without those idea   " we only try to destroy they because we ’re spiritually provide for exactly like the child   " whence have I that joyful knowledge share with the peasant that alone give peace to my soul whence do I get it   " bring up with an idea of god a christian my whole life fill with the spiritual blessing christianity have give I full of they and live on those blessing like the child I do not understand they and destroy that is try to destroy what I live by and as soon as an important moment of life come like the child when they be cold and hungry I turn to he and even less than the child when their mother scold they for their childish mischief do I feel that my childish effort at wanton madness be reckon against I   " yes what I know I know not by reason but it have be give to I reveal to I and I know it with my heart by faith in the chief thing teach by the church   " the church the church " levin repeat to himself he turn over on the other side and lean on his elbow fall to gaze into the distance at a herd of cattle cross over to the river   " but can I believe in all the church teach " he think try himself and think of everything that could destroy his present peace of mind intentionally he recall all those doctrine of the church which have always seem most strange and have always be a stumbling block to he   " the creation but how do I explain existence by existence by nothing the devil and sin but how do I explain evil the atonement   " but I know nothing nothing and I can know nothing but what have be tell to I and all man "   and it seem to he that there be not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing — faith in god in goodness as the one goal of man ’s destiny   under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one ’s desire and each doctrine do not simply leave that faith unshaken each doctrine seem essential to complete that great miracle continually manifest upon earth that make it possible for each man and million of different sort of man wise man and imbecile old man and child — all man peasant lvov kitty beggar and king to understand perfectly the same one thing and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone be worth live and which alone be precious to we   lie on his back he gaze up now into the high cloudless sky " do I not know that that be infinite space and that it be not a round arch but however I screw up my eye and strain my sight I can not see it not round and not bounded and in spite of my know about infinite space I be incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome and more right than when I strain my eye to see beyond it "   levin cease think and only as it be listen to mysterious voice that seem talk joyfully and earnestly within he   " can this be faith " he think afraid to believe in his happiness " my god I thank thee " he say gulp down his sob and with both hand brush away the tear that fill his eye     levin look before he and see a herd of cattle then he catch sight of his trap with raven in the shaft and the coachman who drive up to the herd say something to the herdsman then he hear the rattle of the wheel and the snort of the sleek horse close by he but he be so buried in his thought that he do not even wonder why the coachman have come for he   he only think of that when the coachman have drive quite up to he and shout to he " the mistress send I your brother have come and some gentleman with he "   levin get into the trap and take the rein as though just rouse out of sleep for a long while levin could not collect his faculty he stare at the sleek horse fleck with lather between his haunch and on his neck where the harness rub stare at ivan the coachman sit beside he and remember that he be expect his brother think that his wife be most likely uneasy at his long absence and try to guess who be the visitor who have come with his brother and his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seem to he now quite different from before he fancy that now his relation with all man would be different   " with my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always use to be between we there will be no dispute with kitty there shall never be quarrel with the visitor whoever he may be I will be friendly and nice with the servant with ivan it will all be different "   pull the stiff rein and hold in the good horse that snort with impatience and seem beg to be let go levin look round at ivan sit beside he not know what to do with his unoccupied hand continually press down his shirt as it puff out and he try to find something to start a conversation about with he he would have say that ivan have pull the saddlegirth up too high but that be like blame and he long for friendly warm talk nothing else occur to he   " your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump " say the coachman pull the rein levin hold   " please do not touch and do not teach I " say levin anger by this interference now as always interference make he angry and he feel sorrowfully at once how mistaken have be his supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change he in contact with reality   he be not a quarter of a mile from home when he see grisha and tanya run to meet he   " uncle kostya mamma ’ come and grandfather and sergey ivanovitch and someone else " they say clamber up into the trap   " who be he "   " an awfully terrible person and he do like this with his arm " say tanya get up in the trap and mimic katavasov   " old or young " ask levin laugh remind of someone he do not know whom by tanya ’s performance   " oh I hope it ’ not a tiresome person " think levin   as soon as he turn at a bend in the road and see the party come levin recognize katavasov in a straw hat walk along swinge his arm just as tanya have show he katavasov be very fond of discuss metaphysic have derive his notion from natural science writer who have never study metaphysics and in moscow levin have have many argument with he of late   and one of these argument in which katavasov have obviously consider that he come off victorious be the first thing levin think of as he recognize he   " no whatever I do I will not argue and give utterance to my idea lightly " he think   get out of the trap and greet his brother and katavasov levin ask about his wife   " she have take mitya to kolok " a copse near the house " she mean to have he out there because it ’ so hot indoors " say dolly levin have always advise his wife not to take the baby to the wood think it unsafe and he be not pleased to hear this   " she rush about from place to place with he " say the prince smile " I advise she to try put he in the ice cellar "   " she mean to come to the beehouse she think you would be there we be go there " say dolly   " well and what be you do " say sergey ivanovitch fall back from the rest and walk beside he   " oh nothing special busy as usual with the land " answer levin " well and what about you come for long we have be expect you for such a long time "   " only for a fortnight I ’ve a great deal to do in moscow "   at these word the brother ' eye meet and levin in spite of the desire he always have strong than ever just now to be on affectionate and still more open term with his brother feel an awkwardness in look at he he drop his eye and do not know what to say   cast over the subject of conversation that would be pleasant to sergey ivanovitch and would keep he off the subject of the servian war and the slavonic question at which he have hint by the allusion to what he have to do in moscow levin begin to talk of sergey ivanovitch ’s book   " well have there be review of your book " he ask   sergey ivanovitch smile at the intentional character of the question   " no one be interested in that now and I less than anyone " he say " just look darya alexandrovna we shall have a shower " he add point with a sunshade at the white rain cloud that show above the aspen treetop   and these word be enough to reestablish again between the brother that tone — hardly hostile but chilly — which levin have be so long to avoid   levin go up to katavasov   " it be jolly of you to make up your mind to come " he say to he   " I ’ve be mean to a long while now we shall have some discussion we ’ll see to that have you be read spencer "   " no I ’ve not finish read he " say levin " but I do not need he now "   " how ’ that that ’ interesting why so "   " I mean that I ’m fully convinced that the solution of the problem that interest I I shall never find in he and his like now "   but katavasov ’s serene and goodhumored expression suddenly strike he and he feel such tenderness for his own happy mood which he be unmistakably disturbing by this conversation that he remember his resolution and stop short   " but we ’ll talk later on " he add " if we ’re go to the beehouse it ’ this way along this little path " he say address they all   go along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow cover on one side with thick clump of brilliant heart’sease among which stand up here and there tall dark green tuft of hellebore levin settle his guest in the dense cool shade of the young aspen on a bench and some stump purposely put there for visitor to the beehouse who might be afraid of the bee and he go off himself to the hut to get bread cucumber and fresh honey to regale they with   try to make his movement as deliberate as possible and listen to the bee that buzz more and more frequently past he he walk along the little path to the hut in the very entry one bee hum angrily catch in his beard but he carefully extricate it go into the shady outer room he take down from the wall his veil that hang on a peg and put it on and thrust his hand into his pocket he go into the fencedin beegarden where there stand in the midst of a closely mow space in regular row fasten with bast on post all the hive he know so well the old stock each with its own history and along the fence the young swarm hive that year in front of the opening of the hive it make his eye giddy to watch the bee and drone whirl round and round about the same spot while among they the work bee fly in and out with spoil or in search of they always in the same direction into the wood to the flower lime tree and back to the hive   his ear be fill with the incessant hum in various note now the busy hum of the work bee fly quickly off then the blaring of the lazy drone and the excited buzz of the bee on guard protect their property from the enemy and prepare to sting on the farther side of the fence the old beekeeper be shave a hoop for a tub and he do not see levin levin stand still in the midst of the beehive and do not call he   he be glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life which have already depress his happy mood he think that he have already have time to lose his temper with ivan to show coolness to his brother and to talk flippantly with katavasov   " can it have be only a momentary mood and will it pass and leave no trace " he think but the same instant go back to his mood he feel with delight that something new and important have happen to he real life have only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he have find but it be still untouched within he   just as the bee whirl round he now menace he and distract his attention prevent he from enjoy complete physical peace force he to restrain his movement to avoid they so have the petty care that have swarm about he from the moment he get into the trap restrict his spiritual freedom but that last only so long as he be among they just as his bodily strength be still unaffected in spite of the bee so too be the spiritual strength that he have just become aware of   chapter 15   " do you know kostya with whom sergey ivanovitch travel on his way here " say dolly dole out cucumber and honey to the child " with vronsky he ’ go to servia "   " and not alone he ’ take a squadron out with he at his own expense " say katavasov   " that ’ the right thing for he " say levin " be volunteer still go out then " he add glance at sergey ivanovitch   sergey ivanovitch do not answer he be carefully with a blunt knife get a live bee cover with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb   " I should think so you should have see what be go on at the station yesterday " say katavasov bite with a juicy sound into a cucumber   " well what be one to make of it for mercy ’s sake do explain to I sergey ivanovitch where be all those volunteer go whom be they fight with " ask the old prince unmistakably take up a conversation that have spring up in levin ’s absence   " with the turks " sergey ivanovitch answer smile serenely as he extricate the bee dark with honey and helplessly kick and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf   " but who have declare war on the turks — ivan ivanovitch ragozov and countess lidia ivanovna assist by madame stahl "   " no one have declare war but people sympathize with their neighbor ' suffering and be eager to help they " say sergey ivanovitch   " but the prince be not speak of help " say levin come to the assistance of his fatherinlaw " but of war the prince say that private person can not take part in war without the permission of the government "   " kostya mind that ’ a bee really they ’ll sting we " say dolly wave away a wasp   " but that ’ not a bee it ’ a wasp " say levin   " well now well what ’ your own theory " katavasov say to levin with a smile distinctly challenge he to a discussion " why have not private person the right to do so "   " oh my theory ’ this war be on one side such a beastly cruel and awful thing that no one man not to speak of a christian can individually take upon himself the responsibility of begin war that can only be do by a government which be call upon to do this and be drive inevitably into war on the other hand both political science and common sense teach we that in matter of state and especially in the matter of war private citizen must forego their personal individual will "   sergey ivanovitch and katavasov have their reply ready and both begin speak at the same time   " but the point be my dear fellow that there may be case when the government do not carry out the will of the citizen and then the public assert its will " say katavasov   but evidently sergey ivanovitch do not approve of this answer his brow contract at katavasov ’s word and he say something else   " you do not put the matter in its true light there be no question here of a declaration of war but simply the expression of a human christian feeling our brother one with we in religion and in race be be massacre even suppose they be not our brother nor fellowchristians but simply child woman old people feel be arouse and russians go eagerly to help in stop these atrocity fancy if you be go along the street and see drunken man beat a woman or a child — I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war have be declare on the man but would throw yourself on they and protect the victim "   " but I should not kill they " say levin   " yes you would kill they "   " I do not know if I see that I might give way to my impulse of the moment but I can not say beforehand and such a momentary impulse there be not and there can not be in the case of the oppression of the slavonic people "   " possibly for you there be not but for other there be " say sergey ivanovitch frown with displeasure " there be tradition still extant among the people of slav of the true faith suffer under the yoke of the ' unclean son of hagar ' the people have hear of the suffering of their brother and have speak "   " perhaps so " say levin evasively " but I do not see it I ’m one of the people myself and I do not feel it "   " here be I too " say the old prince " I ’ve be stay abroad and read the paper and I must own up to the time of the bulgarian atrocity I could not make out why it be all the russians be all of a sudden so fond of their slavonic brother while I do not feel the slight affection for they I be very much upset think I be a monster or that it be the influence of carlsbad on I but since I have be here my mind ’ be set at rest I see that there be people besides I who ’re only interested in russia and not in their slavonic brother here ’ konstantin too "   " personal opinion mean nothing in such a case " say sergey ivanovitch " it ’ not a matter of personal opinion when all russia — the whole people — have express its will "   " but excuse I I do not see that the people do not know anything about it if you come to that " say the old prince   " oh papa how can you say that and last sunday in church " say dolly listen to the conversation " please give I a cloth " she say to the old man who be look at the child with a smile " why it ’ not possible that all "   " but what be it in church on sunday the priest have be tell to read that he read it they do not understand a word of it then they be tell that there be to be a collection for a pious object in church well they pull out their halfpence and give they but what for they could not say "   " the people can not help know the sense of their own destiny be always in the people and at such moment as the present that sense find utterance " say sergey ivanovitch with conviction glance at the old beekeeper   the handsome old man with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair stand motionless hold a cup of honey look down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk obviously understand nothing of their conversation and not care to understand it   " that ’ so no doubt " he say with a significant shake of his head at sergey ivanovitch ’s word   " here then ask he he know nothing about it and think nothing " say levin " have you hear about the war mihalitch " he say turn to he " what they read in the church what do you think about it ought we to fight for the christians "   " what should we think alexander nikolaevitch our emperor have think for we he think for we indeed in all thing it ’ clear for he to see shall I bring a bit more bread give the little lad some more " he say address darya alexandrovna and point to grisha who have finish his crust   " I do not need to ask " say sergey ivanovitch " we have see and be see hundred and hundred of people who give up everything to serve a just cause come from every part of russia and directly and clearly express their thought and aim they bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for what do it mean "   " it mean to my thinking " say levin who be begin to get warm " that among eighty million of people there can always be find not hundred as now but ten of thousand of people who have lose caste ne’erdowells who be always ready to go anywhere — to pogatchev ’s band to khiva to servia "   " I tell you that it ’ not a case of hundred or of ne’erdowells but the good representative of the people " say sergey ivanovitch with as much irritation as if he be defend the last penny of his fortune " and what of the subscription in this case it be a whole people directly express their will "   " that word ' people ' be so vague " say levin " parish clerk teacher and one in a thousand of the peasant maybe know what it ’ all about the rest of the eighty million like mihalitch far from express their will have not the faint idea what there be for they to express their will about what right have we to say that this be the people ’s will "   chapter 16   sergey ivanovitch be practice in argument do not reply but at once turn the conversation to another aspect of the subject   " oh if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation of course it ’ very difficult to arrive at it and voting have not be introduce among we and can not be introduce for it do not express the will of the people but there be other way of reach that it be feel in the air it be feel by the heart I will not speak of those deep current which be astir in the still ocean of the people and which be evident to every unprejudiced man let we look at society in the narrow sense all the most diverse section of the educated public hostile before be merge in one every division be at an end all the public organ say the same thing over and over again all feel the mighty torrent that have overtake they and be carry they in one direction "   " you all the newspaper do say the same thing " say the prince " that ’ true but so it be the same thing that all the frog croak before a storm one can hear nothing for they "   " frog or no frog I ’m not the editor of a paper and I do not want to defend they but I be speak of the unanimity in the intellectual world " say sergey ivanovitch address his brother levin would have answer but the old prince interrupt he   " well about that unanimity that ’ another thing one may say " say the prince " there ’ my soninlaw stepan arkadyevitch you know he he ’ get a place now on the committee of a commission and something or other I do not remember only there ’ nothing to do in it — why dolly it ’ no secret — and a salary of eight thousand you try ask he whether his post be of use he ’ll prove to you that it ’ most necessary and he ’ a truthful man too but there ’ no refuse to believe in the utility of eight thousand rouble "   " yes he ask I to give a message to darya alexandrovna about the post " say sergey ivanovitch reluctantly feel the prince ’s remark to be illtimed   " so it be with the unanimity of the press that ’ be explain to I as soon as there ’ war their income be double how can they help believe in the destiny of the people and the slavonic race   and all that "   " I do not care for many of the paper but that ’ unjust " say sergey ivanovitch   " I would only make one condition " pursue the old prince " alphonse karr say a capital thing before the war with prussia ' you consider war to be inevitable very good let everyone who advocate war be enrol in a special regiment of advanceguard for the front of every storm of every attack to lead they all ' "   " a nice lot the editor would make " say katavasov with a loud roar as he picture the editor he know in this pick legion   " but they ’d run " say dolly " they ’d only be in the way "   " oh if they run away then we ’d have grapeshot or cossack with whip behind they " say the prince   " but that ’ a joke and a poor one too if you ’ll excuse my say so prince " say sergey ivanovitch   " I do not see that it be a joke that " levin be begin but sergey ivanovitch interrupt he   " every member of society be call upon to do his own special work " say he " and man of thought be do their work when they express public opinion and the singlehearted and full expression of public opinion be the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice we at the same time twenty year ago we should have be silent but now we have hear the voice of the russian people which be ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brother that be a great step and a proof of strength "   " but it ’ not only make a sacrifice but kill turk " say levin timidly " the people make sacrifice and be ready to make sacrifice for their soul but not for murder " he add instinctively connect the conversation with the idea that have be absorb his mind   " for their soul that ’ a most puzzling expression for a natural science man do you understand what sort of thing be the soul " say katavasov smile   " oh you know "   " no by god I have not the faint idea " say katavasov with a loud roar of laughter   " ' I bring not peace but a sword ' say christ " sergey ivanovitch rejoin for his part quote as simply as though it be the easy thing to understand the very passage that have always puzzle levin most   " that ’ so no doubt " the old man repeat again he be stand near they and respond to a chance glance turn in his direction   " ah my dear fellow you ’re defeat utterly defeat " cry katavasov goodhumoredly   levin redden with vexation not at be defeat but at have fail to control himself and be draw into argument   " no I can not argue with they " he think " they wear impenetrable armor while I ’m naked "   he see that it be impossible to convince his brother and katavasov and he see even less possibility of himself agree with they what they advocate be the very pride of intellect that have almost be his ruin he could not admit that some dozen of man among they his brother have the right on the ground of what they be tell by some hundred of glib volunteer swarm to the capital to say that they and the newspaper be express the will and feeling of the people and a feeling which be express in vengeance and murder he could not admit this because he neither see the expression of such feeling in the people among whom he be live nor find they in himself and he could not but consider himself one of the person make up the russian people and most of all because he like the people do not know and could not know what be for the general good though he know beyond a doubt that this general good could be attain only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which have be reveal to every man and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general object whatever he say as mihalitch do and the people who have express their feeling in the traditional invitation of the varyagi " be prince and rule over we gladly we promise complete submission all the labor all humiliation all sacrifice we take upon ourselves but we will not judge and decide " and now accord to sergey ivanovitch ’s account the people have forego this privilege they have buy at such a costly price   he want to say too that if public opinion be an infallible guide then why be not revolution and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the slavonic people but these be merely thought that could settle nothing one thing could be see beyond doubt — that be that at the actual moment the discussion be irritate sergey ivanovitch and so it be wrong to continue it and levin cease speak and then call the attention of his guest to the fact that the storm cloud be gather and that they have well be go home before it rain     the old prince and sergey ivanovitch get into the trap and drive off the rest of the party hasten homewards on foot   but the stormcloud turn white and then black move down so quickly that they have to quicken their pace to get home before the rain the foremost cloud lower and black as sootladen smoke rush with extraordinary swiftness over the sky they be still two hundred pace from home and a gust of wind have already blow up and every second the downpour might be look for   the child run ahead with frightened and gleeful shriek darya alexandrovna struggle painfully with her skirt that cling round her leg be not walk but run her eye fix on the child the man of the party hold their hat on stride with long step beside she they be just at the step when a big drop fall splash on the edge of the iron guttering the child and their elder after they run into the shelter of the house talk merrily   " katerina alexandrovna " levin ask of agafea mihalovna who meet they with kerchief and rug in the hall   " we think she be with you " she say   " and mitya "   " in the copse he must be and the nurse with he "   levin snatch up the rug and run towards the copse   in that brief interval of time the storm cloud have move on cover the sun so completely that it be dark as an eclipse stubbornly as though insist on its right the wind stop levin and tear the leave and flower off the lime tree and strip the white birch branch into strange unseemly nakedness it twist everything on one side — acacias flower burdock long grass and tall treetop the peasant girl work in the garden run shriek into shelter in the servant ' quarter the stream rain have already fling its white veil over all the distant forest and half the field close by and be rapidly swoop down upon the copse the wet of the rain spurt up in tiny drop could be smell in the air   hold his head bend down before he and struggle with the wind that strive to tear the wrap away from he levin be move up to the copse and have just catch sight of something white behind the oak tree when there be a sudden flash the whole earth seem on fire and the vault of heaven seem crash overhead open his blind eye levin gaze through the thick veil of rain that separate he now from the copse and to his horror the first thing he see be the green crest of the familiar oaktree in the middle of the copse uncannily change its position " can it have be strike " levin hardly have time to think when move more and more rapidly the oak tree vanish behind the other tree and he hear the crash of the great tree fall upon the other   the flash of lightning the crash of thunder and the instantaneous chill that run through he be all merge for levin in one sense of terror   " my god my god not on they " he say   and though he think at once how senseless be his prayer that they should not have be kill by the oak which have fall now he repeat it know that he could do nothing well than utter this senseless prayer   run up to the place where they usually go he do not find they there   they be at the other end of the copse under an old limetree they be call he two figure in dark dress they have be light summer dress when they start out be stand bend over something it be kitty with the nurse the rain be already cease and it be begin to get light when levin reach they the nurse be not wet on the lower part of her dress but kitty be drench through and her soak clothe cling to she though the rain be over they still stand in the same position in which they have be stand when the storm break both stand bend over a perambulator with a green umbrella   " alive unhurt thank god " he say splash with his soak boot through the stand water and run up to they   kitty ’s rosy wet face be turn towards he and she smile timidly under her shapeless sop hat   " be not you ashamed of yourself I can not think how you can be so reckless " he say angrily to his wife   " it be not my fault really we be just mean to go when he make such a todo that we have to change he we be just " kitty begin defend herself   mitya be unharmed dry and still fast asleep   " well thank god I do not know what I ’m say "   they gather up the baby ’s wet belonging the nurse pick up the baby and carry it levin walk beside his wife and penitent for have be angry he squeeze her hand when the nurse be not look     during the whole of that day in the extremely different conversation in which he take part only as it be with the top layer of his mind in spite of the disappointment of not find the change he expect in himself levin have be all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his heart   after the rain it be too wet to go for a walk besides the storm cloud still hang about the horizon and gather here and there black and thundery on the rim of the sky the whole party spend the rest of the day in the house   no more discussion spring up on the contrary after dinner everyone be in the most amiable frame of mind   at first katavasov amuse the lady by his original joke which always please people on their first acquaintance with he then sergey ivanovitch induce he to tell they about the very interesting observation he have make on the habit and characteristic of common housefly and their life sergey ivanovitch too be in good spirit and at tea his brother draw he on to explain his view of the future of the eastern question and he speak so simply and so well that everyone listen eagerly   kitty be the only one who do not hear it all — she be summon to give mitya his bath   a few minute after kitty have leave the room she send for levin to come to the nursery   leave his tea and regretfully interrupt the interesting conversation and at the same time uneasily wonder why he have be send for as this only happen on important occasion levin go to the nursery   although he have be much interested by sergey ivanovitch ’s view of the new epoch in history that would be create by the emancipation of forty million of man of slavonic race act with russia a conception quite new to he and although he be disturb by uneasy wonder at be send for by kitty as soon as he come out of the drawingroom and be alone his mind revert at once to the thought of the morning and all the theory of the significance of the slav element in the history of the world seem to he so trivial compare with what be pass in his own soul that he instantly forget it all and drop back into the same frame of mind that he have be in that morning   he do not as he have do at other time recall the whole train of thought — that he do not need he fall back at once into the feeling which have guide he which be connect with those thought and he find that feeling in his soul even strong and more definite than before he do not as he have have to do with previous attempt to find comforting argument need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling now on the contrary the feeling of joy and peace be keen than ever and thought could not keep pace with feeling   he walk across the terrace and look at two star that have come out in the darken sky and suddenly he remember " yes look at the sky I think that the dome that I see be not a deception and then I think something I shirk face something " he muse " but whatever it be there can be no disprove it I have but to think and all will come clear "   just as he be go into the nursery he remember what it be he have shirk face it be that if the chief proof of the divinity be his revelation of what be right how be it this revelation be confine to the christian church alone what relation to this revelation have the belief of the buddhists mohammedans who preach and do good too   it seem to he that he have an answer to this question but he have not time to formulate it to himself before he go into the nursery   kitty be stand with her sleeve tuck up over the baby in the bath hear her husband ’s footstep she turn towards he summon he to she with her smile with one hand she be support the fat baby that lie float and sprawl on its back while with the other she squeeze the sponge over he   " come look look " she say when her husband come up to she " agafea mihalovna ’ right he know we "   mitya have on that day give unmistakable incontestable sign of recognize all his friend   as soon as levin approach the bath the experiment be try and it be completely successful the cook send for with this object bend over the baby he frown and shake his head disapprovingly kitty bend down to he he give she a beaming smile prop his little hand on the sponge and chirrup make such a queer little contented sound with his lip that kitty and the nurse be not alone in their admiration levin too be surprised and delighted   the baby be take out of the bath drench with water wrap in towel dry and after a piercing scream hand to his mother   " well I be glad you be begin to love he " say kitty to her husband when she have settle herself comfortably in her usual place with the baby at her breast " I be so glad it have begin to distress I you say you have no feeling for he "   " no do I say that I only say I be disappointed "   " what disappoint in he "   " not disappointed in he but in my own feeling I have expect more I have expect a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise and then instead of that — disgust pity "   she listen attentively look at he over the baby while she put back on her slender finger the ring she have take off while give mitya his bath   " and most of all at there be far more apprehension and pity than pleasure today after that fright during the storm I understand how I love he "   kitty ’s smile be radiant   " be you very much frightened " she say " so be I too but I feel it more now that it ’ over I ’m go to look at the oak how nice katavasov be and what a happy day we ’ve have altogether and you ’re so nice with sergey ivanovitch when you care to be well go back to they it ’ always so hot and steamy here after the bath "     go out of the nursery and be again alone levin go back at once to the thought in which there be something not clear   instead of go into the drawingroom where he hear voice he stop on the terrace and lean his elbow on the parapet he gaze up at the sky   it be quite dark now and in the south where he be look there be no cloud the storm have drift on to the opposite side of the sky and there be flash of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter levin listen to the monotonous drip from the lime tree in the garden and look at the triangle of star he know so well and the milky way with its branch that run through its midst at each flash of lightning the milky way and even the bright star vanish but as soon as the lightning die away they reappear in their place as though some hand have fling they back with careful aim   " well what be it perplex I " levin say to himself feel beforehand that the solution of his difficulty be ready in his soul though he do not know it yet " yes the one unmistakable incontestable manifestation of the divinity be the law of right and wrong which have come into the world by revelation and which I feel in myself and in the recognition of which — I do not make myself but whether I will or not — I be make one with other man in one body of believer which be call the church well but the jews the mohammedans the confucians the buddhists — what of they " he put to himself the question he have fear to face " can these hundred of million of man be deprive of that high blessing without which life have no meaning " he ponder a moment but immediately correct himself " but what be I question " he say to himself " I be question the relation to divinity of all the different religion of all mankind I be question the universal manifestation of god to all the world with all those misty blur what be I about to I individually to my heart have be reveal a knowledge you all doubt and unattainable by reason and here I be obstinately try to express that knowledge in reason and word   " do not I know that the star do not move " he ask himself gaze at the bright planet which have shift its position up to the topmost twig of the birchtree " but look at the movement of the star I can not picture to myself the rotation of the earth and I ’m right in say that the star move   " and could the astronomer have understand and calculate anything if they have take into account all the complicated and varied motion of the earth all the marvelous conclusion they have reach about the distance weight movement and deflection of the heavenly body be only found on the apparent motion of the heavenly body about a stationary earth on that very motion I see before I now which have be so for million of man during long age and be and will be always alike and can always be trust and just as the conclusion of the astronomer would have be vain and uncertain if not found on observation of the see heaven in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon so would my conclusion be vain and uncertain if not found on that conception of right which have be and will be always alike for all man which have be reveal to I as a christian and which can always be trust in my soul the question of other religion and their relation to divinity I have no right to decide and no possibility of decide "   " oh you have not go in then " he hear kitty ’s voice all at once as she come by the same way to the drawingroom   " what be it you ’re not worried about anything " she say look intently at his face in the starlight   but she could not have see his face if a flash of lightning have not hide the star and reveal it in that flash she see his face distinctly and see he calm and happy she smile at he   " she understand " he think " she know what I ’m think about shall I tell she or not yes I ’ll tell she " but at the moment he be about to speak she begin speak   " kostya do something for I " she say " go into the corner room and see if they ’ve make it all right for sergey ivanovitch I can not very well see if they ’ve put the new wash stand in it "   " very well I ’ll go directly " say levin stand up and kiss she   " no I ’d well not speak of it " he think when she have go in before he " it be a secret for I alone of vital importance for I and not to be put into word   " this new feeling have not change I have not make I happy and enlightened all of a sudden as I have dream just like the feeling for my child there be no surprise in this either faith — or not faith — I do not know what it be — but this feeling have come just as imperceptibly through suffering and have take firm root in my soul   " I shall go on in the same way lose my temper with ivan the coachman fall into angry discussion express my opinion tactlessly there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people even my wife I shall still go on scold she for my own terror and be remorseful for it I shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why I pray and I shall still go on pray but my life now my whole life apart from anything that can happen to I every minute of it be no more meaningless as it be before but it have the positive meaning of goodness which I have the power to put into it "
