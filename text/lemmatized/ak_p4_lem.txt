to show he the sight worth see vronsky be of distinguished appearance he possess moreover the art of behave with respectful dignity and be used to have to do with such grand personage — that be how he

of russian woman whom he wish to study more than once make vronsky crimson with indignation the chief reason why the prince be so particularly disagreeable to vronsky be that he could not help see himself in he and what he see in this mirror do not gratify his selfesteem he be a very stupid and very selfsatisfied and very healthy and very wellwashed man and nothing else he be a gentleman — that be true and vronsky could not deny it he be equable and not cringe with his superior be free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equal and be contemptuously indulgent with his inferior vronsky be himself the same and regard it as a great merit to be so but for this prince he be an inferior and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to he revolt he " brainless beef can I be like that " he think be that as it might when on the seventh day he part from the prince who be start for moscow and receive his thank he be happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant

day of his conversation with anna in the vrede garden unconsciously yield to the weakness of anna — who have surrender herself up to he utterly and simply look to he to decide her fate ready to submit to anything — he have long cease to think that their tie might end as he have think then his ambitious plan have retreat into the background again and feel that he have get out of that circle of

the lamplight while the slender wrist move swiftly nervously in the embroidered cuff " how be it then where do you meet alexey alexandrovitch " her voice sound in an unnatural and jarring tone " we run up against each other in the doorway " " and he bow to you like this " she draw a long face and halfclose her eye quickly transform her expression fold her hand and vronsky suddenly see in her beautiful face the very expression with which alexey alexandrovitch have bow to he he smile while she laugh gaily with that sweet deep laugh which be one of her great charm " I do not understand he in

husband and child for a lover while you eat your husband ’s bread " she bow her head she do not say what she have say the evening before to her lover that he be her husband and her husband be superfluous she do not even think that she feel all the justice of his word and only say softly " you can not describe my position as bad than I feel it to be myself but what be you you all this for " " what be I say it for what for " he go on as angrily " that you may know that since you have not carry out my wish in regard to observe outward decorum I will take measure to put an end to this state

and be utterly unable to articulate the word " suffering " in the end he pronounce it " thuffering " she want to laugh and be immediately ashamed that anything could amuse she at such a moment and for the first time for an instant she feel for he put herself in his place and be sorry for he but what could she say or do her head sink and she sit silent he too be silent for some time and then begin speak in a frigid less shrill voice emphasize random word that have no special significance " I come to tell you " he say she glance at he " no it be my fancy " she think recall the expression of his face when he stumble over the word " suffer " " no can a man with those dull eye with that selfsatisfied complacency feel anything " " I can not change anything " she whisper " I have come to tell you

himself very fastidious be exceptionally good he could not help observe this one of the clerk without get up turn wrathfully to alexey alexandrovitch half close his eye " what be you want " he reply that he have to see the lawyer on some business " he be engaged " the clerk respond severely and he point with his pen at the person wait and go on write " can not he spare time to see I " say alexey alexandrovitch " he have no time free he be always busy kindly wait your turn " " then I must trouble you to give he my card " alexey alexandrovitch say with dignity see the impossibility of preserve his incognito the clerk take the card and obviously not approve of what he read on it go to the door alexey alexandrovitch be in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceeding though for some high official consideration he dislike the application of the principle in russia and disapprove of it as far as he could disapprove of anything institute by authority of the emperor his whole life have be spend in administrative work and consequently when he do not approve of anything his disapproval be soften by the recognition of the inevitability of mistake and the possibility of reform in every department in the new public law court he dislike the restriction lay on the lawyer conduct case but till then he have have nothing to do with the law court and so have disapprove of their publicity simply in theory now his disapprobation be strengthen by the unpleasant impression make on he in the lawyer ’s waiting room " come immediately " say the clerk and two minute later there do actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who have be consult with the lawyer himself the lawyer be a little squat bald man with a dark reddish beard lightcolored long eyebrow and an overhanging brow he be attire as though for a wedding from his cravat to his double watchchain and varnish boot his face be clever and manly but his dress be dandified and in bad taste " pray walk in " say the lawyer address alexey alexandrovitch and gloomily usher karenin in before he he close the door " will not you sit down " he indicate an armchair at a writingtable cover with paper he sit down himself and rub his little hand with short finger cover with white hair he bend his head on one side but as soon as he be settle in this position a moth fly over the table the lawyer with a swiftness that could never have be expect of he open his hand catch the moth and resume his former attitude " before begin to speak of my business " say alexey alexandrovitch follow the lawyer ’s movement with wonder eye " I ought to observe that the business about which I have to speak to you be to be strictly private " the lawyer ’s overhanging reddish mustache be part in a scarcely perceptible smile " I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secret confide to I but if you would like proof " alexey alexandrovitch glance at his face and see that the shrewd gray eye be laugh and seem to know all about it already " you know my name " alexey alexandrovitch resume " I know you and the good”—again he catch a moth—“work you be do like every russian " say the lawyer bow alexey alexandrovitch sigh pluck up his courage but have once make up his mind he go on in his shrill voice without timidity — or hesitation accentuate here and there a word " I have the misfortune " alexey alexandrovitch begin " to have be deceive in my married life and I desire to break off all relation with my wife by legal mean — that is to be divorce but to do this so that my son may not remain with his mother " the lawyer ’s gray eye try not to laugh but they be dance with irrepressible glee and alexey alexandrovitch see that it be not simply the delight of a man who have just get a profitable job there be triumph and joy there be a gleam like the malignant gleam he see in his wife ’s eye " you desire my assistance in secure a divorce " " yes precisely so but I ought to warn you that I may be waste your time and attention I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step I want a divorce but the form in which it be possible be of great consequence to I it be very possible that if that form do not correspond with my requirement I may give up a legal divorce " " oh that ’ always the case " say the lawyer " and that ’ always for you to decide " he let his eye rest on alexey alexandrovitch ’s foot feel that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement he look at a moth that fly before his nose and move his hand but do not catch it from regard for alexey alexandrovitch ’s position " though in their general feature our law on this subject be know to I " pursue alexey alexandrovitch " I should be glad to have an idea of the form in which such thing be do in practice " " you would be glad " the lawyer without lift his eye respond adopt with a certain satisfaction the tone of his client ’s remark " for I to lay before you all the method by which you could secure what you desire " and on receive an assuring nod from alexey alexandrovitch he go on steal a glance now and then at alexey alexandrovitch ’s face which be grow red in patch " divorce by our law " he say with a slight shade of disapprobation of our law " be possible as you be aware in the follow case wait a little " he call to a clerk who put his head in at the door but he get up all the same say a few word to he and sit down again " in the follow case physical defect in the married parties desertion without communication for five year " he say crook a short finger cover with hair " adultery " this word he pronounce with obvious satisfaction " subdivide as follow " he continue to crook his fat finger though the three case and their subdivision could obviously not be classify together " physical defect of the husband or of the wife adultery of the husband or of the wife " as by now all his finger be use up he uncrooke all his finger and go on " this be the theoretical view but I imagine you have do I the honor to apply to I in order to learn its application in practice and therefore guide by precedent I must inform you that in practice case of divorce you all be reduce to the follow — there ’ no physical defect I may assume nor desertion " alexey alexandrovitch bow his head in assent " — may be reduce to the follow adultery of one of the marry party and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement and fail such agreement accidental detection it must be admit that the latter case be rarely meet with in practice " say the lawyer and steal a glance at alexey alexandrovitch he pause as a man sell pistol after enlarge on the advantage of each weapon might await his customer ’s choice but alexey alexandrovitch say nothing and therefore the lawyer go on " the most usual and simple the sensible course I consider be adultery by mutual consent I should not permit myself to express it so speak with a man of no education " he say " but I imagine that to you this be comprehensible " alexey alexandrovitch be however so perturbed that he do not immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent and his eye express this uncertainty but the lawyer promptly come to his assistance " people can not go on live together — here you have a fact and if both be agree about it the detail and formality become a matter of no importance and at the same time this be the simple and most certain method " alexey alexandrovitch fully understand now but he have religious scruple which hinder the execution of such a plan " that be out of the question in the present case " he say " only one alternative be possible undesigned detection support by letter which I have " at the mention of letter the lawyer purse up his lip and give utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound " kindly consider " he begin " case of that kind be as you be aware under ecclesiastical jurisdiction the reverend father be fond of go into the minute detail in case of that kind " he say with a smile which betray his sympathy with the reverend father ' taste " letter may of course be a partial confirmation but detection in the fact there must be of the most direct kind that be by eyewitness in fact if you do I the honor to intrust your confidence to I you will do well to leave I the

tell you I do value my idea and my work awfully but in reality only consider this all this world of ours be nothing but a speck of mildew which have grow up on a tiny planet and for we to suppose we can have something great — idea work — it ’ all dust and ashe " " but all that ’ as old as the hill my boy " " it be old but do you know when you grasp this fully then somehow everything become of no consequence when you understand that you will die tomorrow if not today and nothing will be leave then everything be so unimportant and I consider my idea very important but it turn out really to be as unimportant too even if it be carry out as do for that bear so one go on live amuse oneself with hunting with work — anything so as not to think of death " stepan arkadyevitch smile a subtle affectionate smile as he listen to levin " well of course here you ’ve come round to my point do you remember you attack I for seek enjoyment in life do not be so severe o moralist " " no all the same what ’ fine in life be " levin hesitated—“oh I do not know all I know be that we shall soon be dead " " why so soon " " and do you know there ’ less charm in life when one think of death but there ’

find it in moscow the member of this deputation have not the slight conception of their duty and the part they be to play they naïvely believe that it be their business to lay before the commission their need and the actual condition of thing and to ask assistance of the government and utterly fail to grasp that some of their statement and request support the contention of the enemy ’s side and so spoil the whole business alexey alexandrovitch be busily engage with they for a long while draw up a program for they from which they be not to depart and on dismiss they write a letter to

ink and paper he have grow more and more used to his own intention and by now distinctly perceive the feasibility of its execution he be seal the envelope to the lawyer when he hear the loud tone of stepan arkadyevitch ’s voice stepan arkadyevitch be dispute with alexey alexandrovitch ’s servant and insist on be announce " no matter " think alexey alexandrovitch " so much the well I will inform

glad I ’ve find you so I hope " stepan arkadyevitch begin cheerfully " I can not come " alexey alexandrovitch say coldly stand and not ask his visitor to sit down alexey alexandrovitch have think to

whatever explanation he might make his relation with his brotherinlaw would remain unchanged " yes I be bring to the painful necessity of seek a divorce " he say " I will say one thing alexey alexandrovitch I know you for an excellent upright man I know anna — excuse I I can not change my opinion of she — for a good an excellent woman and so excuse I I can not believe it there be some misunderstanding " say he " oh if it be merely a misunderstanding " " pardon I understand " interpose stepan arkadyevitch " but of course one thing you must not act in haste you must not you must not

arkadyevitch " I would do one thing alexey alexandrovitch I beseech you do it " he say " no action have yet be take if I understand rightly before you take advice see my wife talk to she she love anna like a sister she love you and she ’ a wonderful woman for god ’s sake talk to she do I that favor I beseech you " alexey alexandrovitch ponder and stepan arkadyevitch look at he sympathetically without interrupt his silence " you will go to see she " " I do not know that be just why I have not be to see you I imagine our relation must change " " why so I do not see that allow I to believe that apart from our connection you have for I at least in part the same friendly feeling I have always have for you   and sincere esteem " say stepan arkadyevitch press his hand " even if your bad

about what interest they both — the new head of stepan arkadyevitch ’s department a man not yet old who have suddenly be promote to so high a position alexey alexandrovitch have previously feel no liking for count anitchkin and have always differ from he in his opinion but now from a feeling readily comprehensible to official — that hatred feel by one who have suffer a defeat in the service for one who have receive a promotion he could not endure he " well have you see he " say alexey alexandrovitch with a malignant smile " of course he be at our sitting yesterday he seem to know his work capitally and to be very energetic " " yes but what be his energy direct to " say alexey alexandrovitch " be he aim at do anything or simply undo what ’ be do it ’ the great misfortune of our

they both be man respect for their character and their intelligence they respect each other but be in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject not because they belong to opposite party but precisely because they be of the same party their enemy refuse to see any distinction between their view but in that party each have his own special shade of opinion and since no difference be less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semiabstract question they never agree in any opinion and have long indeed be accustom to jeer without anger each at the other ’s incorrigible aberration they be just go in at the door talk of the weather when stepan arkadyevitch overtake they in the drawingroom there be already sit prince alexander dmitrievitch shtcherbatsky

meaning there be for he in every sound in every turn of her lip her eye her hand as she say it there be entreaty for forgiveness and trust in he and tenderness — soft timid tenderness — and promise and hope and love for he which he could not but believe in and which choke he with happiness " no we ’ve be hunt in the tver province it be come back from there that I meet your beaufrère in the train or your beaufrère ’s brotherinlaw " he say with a smile " it be an amusing meeting " and he begin tell with droll goodhumor how after not sleep all night he have wear an old furlined fullskirted coat get into alexey alexandrovitch ’s compartment " the conductor forget the proverb would have chuck I out on account of my attire but thereupon I begin express my feeling in elevated language and   you too " he say address karenin and forget his name " at first would have eject I on the ground of the old coat but afterwards you take my part for which I be extremely grateful " " the right of passenger generally to choose their seat be too illdefined " say alexey alexandrovitch rub the tip of his finger on his handkerchief " I see you be in uncertainty about I " say levin smile goodnaturedly " but I make haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defect of my attire " sergey ivanovitch while he keep up a conversation with their hostess have one ear for his brother and he glance askance at he " what be the matter with he today why such a conquer hero " he think he do not know that levin be feel as though he have grow wing levin know she be listen to his word and that she be glad to listen to he and this be the only thing that interest he not in that room only but in the whole world there exist for he only himself with enormously increase importance and dignity in his own eye and she he feel himself on a pinnacle that make he giddy and far away down below be all those nice excellent karenins oblonskys and all the world quite without attract notice without glance at they as though there be no other place leave stepan arkadyevitch put levin and kitty side by side " oh you may as well sit there " he say to levin the dinner be as choice as the china in which stepan arkadyevitch be a connoisseur the soupe marielouise be a splendid success the tiny pie eat with it melt in the mouth and be irreproachable the two footman and matvey in white cravat do their duty with the dish and wine unobtrusively quietly and swiftly on the material side the dinner be a success it be no less so on the immaterial the conversation at time general and at time between individual never pause and towards the end the company be so lively that the man rise from the table without stop speak and even alexey alexandrovitch thaw pestsov like thrash an argument out to the end and be not satisfied with sergey ivanovitch ’s word especially as he feel the injustice of his view " I do not mean " he say over the soup address alexey alexandrovitch " mere density of population alone but in conjunction with fundamental idea and not by mean of principle " " it seem to I " alexey alexandrovitch say languidly and with no haste " that that ’ the same thing in my opinion influence over another people be only possible to the people which have the high development which " " but that ’ just the question " pestsov break in in his bass he be always in a hurry to speak and seem always to put his whole soul into what he be say " in what be we to make high development consist the english the french the germans which be at the high stage of development which of they will nationalize the other we see the rhine province have be turn french but the germans be not at a low stage " he shout " there be another law at work there " " I fancy that the great influence be always on the side of true civilization " say alexey alexandrovitch slightly lift his eyebrow " but what be we to lay down as the outward sign of true civilization " say pestsov " I imagine such sign be generally very well know " say alexey alexandrovitch " but be they fully know " sergey ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile " it be the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical but we see most intense dispute on each side of the question and there be no deny that the opposite camp have strong point in its favor " " you be for classic sergey ivanovitch will you take red wine " say stepan arkadyevitch " I be not express my own opinion of either form of culture " sergey ivanovitch say hold out his glass with a smile of condescension as to a child " I only say that both side have strong argument to support they " he go on address alexey alexandrovitch " my sympathy be classical from education but in this discussion I be personally unable to arrive at a conclusion I see no distinct ground for classical study be give a preeminence over scientific study " " the natural science have just as great an educational value " put in pestsov " take astronomy take botany or zoology with its system of general principle " " I can not quite agree with that " respond alexey alexandrovitch " it seem to I that one must admit that the very process of study the form of language have a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development moreover it can not be deny that the influence of the classical author be in the high degree moral while unfortunately with the study of the natural science be associate the false and noxious doctrine which be the curse of our day " sergey ivanovitch would have say something but pestsov interrupt he in his rich bass he begin warmly contest the justice of this view sergey ivanovitch wait serenely to speak obviously with a convincing reply ready " but " say sergey ivanovitch smile subtly and address karenin " one must allow that to weigh all the advantage and disadvantage of classical and scientific study be a difficult task and the question which form of education be to be prefer would not have be so quickly and conclusively decide if there have not be in favor of classical education as you express it just now its moral — disons le mot — antinihilist influence " " undoubtedly " " if it have not be for the distinctive property of antinihilistic influence on the side of classical study we should have consider the subject more have weigh the argument on both side " say sergey ivanovitch with a subtle smile " we should have give elbowroom to both tendency but now we know that these little pill of classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism and we boldly prescribe they to our patient but what if they have no such medicinal property " he wind up humorously at sergey ivanovitch ’s little pill everyone laugh turovtsin in especial roar loudly and jovially glad at last to have find something to laugh at all he ever look for in listen to conversation stepan arkadyevitch have not make a mistake in invite pestsov with pestsov intellectual conversation never flag for an instant directly sergey ivanovitch have conclude the conversation with his jest pestsov promptly start a new one " I can not agree even " say he " that the government have that aim the government obviously be guide by abstract consideration and remain indifferent to the influence its measure may exercise the education of woman for instance would naturally be regard as likely to be harmful but the government open school and university for woman " and the conversation at once pass to the new subject of the education of woman alexey alexandrovitch express the idea that the education of woman be apt to be confound with the emancipation of woman and that it be only so that it can be consider dangerous " I consider on the contrary that the two question be inseparably connect together " say pestsov " it be a vicious circle woman be deprive of right from lack of education and the lack of education result from the absence of right we must not forget that the subjection of woman be so complete and date from such age back that we be often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separate they from we " say he " you say right " say sergey ivanovitch wait till pestsov have finish " mean the right of sit on jury of voting of preside at official meeting the right of enter the civil service of sit in parliament " " undoubtedly " " but if woman as a rare exception can occupy such position it seem to I you be wrong in use the expression ' right ' it would be more correct to say duty every man will agree that in do the duty of a juryman a witness a telegraph clerk we feel we be perform duty and therefore it would be correct to say that woman be seek duty and quite legitimately and one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man " " quite so " alexey alexandrovitch assent " the question I imagine be simply whether they be fit for such duty " " they will most likely be perfectly fit " say stepan arkadyevitch " when education have become general among they we see this " " how about the proverb " say the prince who have a long while be intent on the conversation his little comical eye twinkle " I can say it before my daughter her hair be long because her wit be " " just what they think of the negro before their emancipation " say pestsov angrily " what seem strange to I be that woman should seek fresh duty " say sergey ivanovitch " while we see unhappily that man usually try to avoid they " " duty be bind up with right — power money honor those be what woman be seek " say pestsov " just as though I should seek the right to be a wetnurse and feel injure because woman be pay for the work while no one will take I " say the old prince turovtsin explode in a loud roar of laughter and sergey ivanovitch regret that he have not make this comparison even alexey alexandrovitch smile " yes but a man can not nurse a baby " say pestsov " while a woman " " no there be an englishman who do suckle his baby on board ship " say the old prince feel this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughter " there be as many such englishmen as there would be woman official " say sergey ivanovitch " yes but what be a girl to do who have no family " put in stepan arkadyevitch think of masha tchibisova whom he have have in his mind all along in sympathize with pestsov and support he " if the story of such a girl be thoroughly sift you would find she have abandon a family — her own or a sister ’s where she might have find a woman ’s duty " darya alexandrovna break in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation probably suspect what sort of girl stepan arkadyevitch be think of " but we take our stand on principle as the ideal " reply pestsov in his mellow bass " woman desire to have right to be independent educate she be oppress humiliate by the consciousness of her disability " " and I ’m oppress and humiliate that they will not engage I at the foundling " the old prince say again to the huge delight of turovtsin who in his mirth drop his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce everyone take part in the conversation except kitty and levin at first when they be talk of the influence that one people have on another there rise to levin ’s mind what he have to say on the subject but these idea once of such importance in his eye seem to come into his brain as in a dream and have now not the slight interest for he it even strike he as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what be of no use to anyone kitty too should one would have suppose have be interested in what they be say of the right and education of woman how often she have muse on the subject think of her friend abroad varenka of her painful state of dependence how often she have wonder about herself what would become of she if she do not marry and how often she have argue with her sister about it but it do not interest she at all she and levin have a conversation of their own yet not a conversation but some sort of mysterious communication which bring they every moment near and stir in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they be enter at first levin in answer to kitty ’s question how he could have see she last year in the carriage tell she how he have be come home from the mowing along the highroad and have meet she " it be very very early in the morning you be probably only just awake your mother be asleep in the corner it be an exquisite morning I be walk along wonder who it could be in a fourinhand it be a splendid set of four horse with bell and in a second you flash by and I see you at the window — you be sit like this hold the string of your cap in both hand and think awfully deeply about something " he say smile " how I should like to know what you be think about then something important " " be not I dreadfully untidy " she wonder but see the smile of ecstasy these reminiscence call up she feel that the impression she have make have be very good she blush and laugh with delight " really I do not remember " " how nicely turovtsin laugh " say levin admire his moist eye and shake chest " have you know he long " ask kitty " oh everyone know he " " and I see you think he ’ a horrid man " " not horrid but nothing in he " " oh you ’re wrong and you must give up think so directly " say kitty " I use to have a very poor opinion of he too but he he ’ an awfully nice and wonderfully goodhearted man he have a heart of gold " " how could you find out what sort of heart he have " " we be great friend I know he very well last winter soon after   you come to see we " she say with a guilty and at the same time confiding smile " all dolly ’s child have scarlet fever and he happen to come and see she and only fancy " she say in a whisper " he feel so sorry for she that he stay and begin to help she look after the child yes and for three week he stop with they and look after the child like a nurse " " I be tell konstantin dmitrievitch about turovtsin in the scarlet fever " she say bend over to her sister " yes it be wonderful noble " say dolly glance towards turovtsin who have become aware they be talk of he and smile gently to he levin glance once more at turovtsin and wonder how it be he have not realize all this man ’s goodness before " I ’m sorry I ’m sorry and I ’ll never think ill of people again " he say gaily genuinely express what he feel at the moment connect with the conversation that have spring up on the right of woman there be certain question as to the inequality of right in marriage improper to discuss before the lady pestsov have several time during dinner touch upon these question but sergey ivanovitch and stepan arkadyevitch carefully draw he off they when they rise from the table and the lady have go out pestsov do not follow they but address alexey alexandrovitch begin to expound the chief ground of inequality the inequality in marriage in his opinion lie in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the infidelity of the husband be punish unequally both by the law and by public opinion stepan arkadyevitch go hurriedly up to alexey alexandrovitch and offer he a cigar " no I do n’t smoke " alexey alexandrovitch answer calmly and as though purposely wish to show that he be not afraid of the subject he turn to pestsov with a chilly smile " I imagine that such a view have a foundation in the very nature of thing " he say and would have go on to the drawingroom but at this point turovtsin break suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation address alexey alexandrovitch " you hear perhaps about pryatchnikov " say turovtsin warm up by the champagne he have drink and long wait for an opportunity to break the silence that have weigh on he " vasya pryatchnikov " he say with a goodnatured smile on his damp red lip address himself principally to the most important guest alexey alexandrovitch " they tell I today he fight a duel with kvitsky at tver and have kill he " just as it always seem that one bruise oneself on a sore place so stepan arkadyevitch feel now that the conversation would by ill luck fall every moment on alexey alexandrovitch ’s sore spot he would again have get his brotherinlaw away but alexey alexandrovitch himself inquire with curiosity " what do pryatchnikov fight about " " his wife act like a man he do call he out and shoot he " " ah " say alexey alexandrovitch indifferently and lift his eyebrow he go into the drawingroom " how glad I be you have come " dolly say with a frightened smile meet he in the outer drawingroom " I must talk to you let ’s sit here " alexey alexandrovitch with the same expression of indifference give he by his lift eyebrow sit down beside darya alexandrovna and smile affectedly " it ’ fortunate " say he " especially as I be mean to ask you to excuse I and to be take leave I have to start tomorrow " darya alexandrovna be firmly convince of anna ’s innocence and she feel herself grow pale and her lip quiver with anger at this frigid unfeeling man who be so calmly intend to ruin her innocent friend " alexey alexandrovitch " she say with desperate resolution look he in the face " I ask you about anna you make I no answer how be she " " she be I believe quite well darya alexandrovna " reply alexey alexandrovitch not look at she " alexey alexandrovitch forgive I I have no right   but I love anna as a sister and esteem she I beg I beseech you to tell I what be wrong between you what fault do you find with she " alexey alexandrovitch frown and almost close his eye drop his head " I presume that your husband have tell you the ground on which I consider it necessary to change my attitude to anna arkadyevna " he say not look she in the face but eye with displeasure shtcherbatsky who be walk across the drawingroom " I do not believe it I do not believe it I can not believe it " dolly say clasp her bony hand before she with a vigorous gesture she rise quickly and lay her hand on alexey alexandrovitch ’s sleeve " we shall be disturb here come this way please " dolly ’s agitation have an effect on alexey alexandrovitch he get up and submissively follow she to the schoolroom they sit down to a table cover with an oilcloth cut in slit by penknife " I do not I do not believe it " dolly say try to catch his glance that avoid she " one can not disbelieve fact darya alexandrovna " say he with an emphasis on the word " fact " " but what have she do " say darya alexandrovna " what precisely have she do " " she have forsake her duty and deceive her husband that ’ what she have do " say he " no no it can not be no for god ’s sake you be mistaken " say dolly put her hand to her temple and close her eye alexey alexandrovitch smile coldly with his lip alone mean to signify to she and to himself the firmness of his conviction but this warm defense though it could not shake he reopen his wound he begin to speak with great heat " it be extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself inform her husband of the fact — inform he that eight year of her life and a son all that ’ a mistake and that she want to begin life again " he say angrily with a snort " anna and sin — I can not connect they I can not believe it " " darya alexandrovna " he say now look straight into dolly ’s kindly troubled face and feel that his tongue be be loosen in spite of himself " I would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible when I doubt I be miserable but it be well than now when I doubt I have hope but now there be no hope and still I doubt of everything I be in such doubt of everything that I even hate my son and sometimes do not believe he be my son I be very unhappy " he have no need to say that darya alexandrovna have see that as soon as he glance into her face and she feel sorry for he and her faith in the innocence of her friend begin to totter " oh this be awful awful but can it be true that you be resolve on a divorce " " I be resolved on extreme measure there be nothing else for I to do " " nothing else to do nothing else to do " she reply with tear in her eye " oh no do not say nothing else to do " she say " what be horrible in a trouble of this kind be that one can not as in any other — in loss in death — bear one ’s trouble in peace but that one must act " say he as though guess her thought " one must get out of the humiliating position in which one be place one can not live à trois " " I understand I quite understand that " say dolly and her head sink she be silent for a little thinking of herself of her own grief in her family and all at once with an impulsive movement she raise her head and clasp her hand with an imploring gesture " but wait a little you be a christian think of she what will become of she if you cast she off " " I have think darya alexandrovna I have think a great deal " say alexey alexandrovitch his face turn red in patch and his dim eye look straight before he darya alexandrovna at that moment pity he with all her heart " that be what I do indeed when she herself make known to I my humiliation I leave everything as of old I give she a chance to reform I try to save she and with what result she would not regard the slight request — that she should observe decorum " he say get heated " one may save anyone who do not want to be ruin but if the whole nature be so corrupt so depraved that ruin itself seem to be her salvation what ’ to be do " " anything only not divorce " answer darya alexandrovna " but what be anything " " no it be awful she will be no one ’s wife she will be lose " " what can I do " say alexey alexandrovitch raise his shoulder and his eyebrow the recollection of his wife ’s last act have so incense he that he have become frigid as at the beginning of the conversation " I be very grateful for your sympathy but I must be go " he say get up " no wait a minute you must not ruin she wait a little I will tell you about myself I be marry and my husband deceive I in anger and jealousy I would have throw up everything I would myself but I come to myself again and who do it anna save I and here I be live on the child be grow up my husband have come back to his family and feel his fault be grow purer well and I live on I have forgive it and you ought to forgive " alexey alexandrovitch hear she but her word have no effect on he now all the hatred of that day when he have resolve on a divorce have spring up again in his soul he shake himself and say in a shrill loud voice " forgive I can not and do not wish to and I regard it as wrong I have do everything for this woman and she have tread it all in the mud to which she be akin I be not a spiteful man I have never hate anyone but I hate she with my whole soul and I can not even forgive she because I hate she too much for all the wrong she have do I " he say with tone of hatred in his voice " love those that hate you " darya alexandrovna whisper timorously alexey alexandrovitch smile contemptuously that he know long ago but it could not be apply to his case " love those that hate you but to love those one hate be impossible forgive I for have trouble you everyone have enough to bear in his own grief " and regain his selfpossession alexey alexandrovitch quietly take leave and go away when they rise from table levin would have like to follow kitty into the drawingroom but he be afraid she might dislike this as too obviously pay her attention he remain in the little ring of man take part in the general conversation and without look at kitty he be aware of her movement her look and the place where she be in the drawingroom he do at once and without the small effort keep the promise he have make she — always to think well of all man and to like everyone always the conversation fall on the village commune in which pestsov see a sort of special principle call by he the " choral " principle levin do not agree with pestsov nor with his brother who have a special attitude of his own both admit and not admit the significance of the russian commune but he talk to they simply try to reconcile and soften their difference he be not in the least interested in what he say himself and even less so in what they say all he want be that they and everyone should be happy and contented he know now the one thing of importance and that one thing be at first there in the drawingroom and then begin move across and come to a standstill at the door without turn round he feel the eye fix on he and the smile and he could not help turn round she be stand in the doorway with shtcherbatsky look at he " I think you be go towards the piano " say he go up to she " that ’ something I miss in the country — music " " no we only come to fetch you and thank you " she say reward he with a smile that be like a gift " for come what do they want to argue for no one ever convince anyone you know " " yes that ’ true " say levin " it generally happen that one argue warmly simply because one can not make out what one ’s opponent want to prove " levin have often notice in discussion between the most intelligent people that after enormous effort and an enormous expenditure of logical subtlety and word the disputant finally arrive at be aware that what they have so long be struggle to prove to one another have long ago from the beginning of the argument be know to both but that they like different thing and would not define what they like for fear of its be attack he have often have the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasp what it be his opponent like and at once like it too and immediately he find himself agree and then all argument fall away as useless sometimes too he have experience the opposite express at last what he like himself which he be devise argument to defend and chance to express it well and genuinely he have find his opponent at once agree and cease to dispute his position he try to say this she knit her brow try to understand but directly he begin to illustrate his meaning she understand at once " I know one must find out what he be argue for what be precious to he then one can " she have completely guess and express his badly express idea levin smile joyfully he be strike by this transition from the confused verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic clear almost wordless communication of the most complex idea shtcherbatsky move away from they and kitty go up to a cardtable sit down and take up the chalk begin draw diverge circle over the new green cloth they begin again on the subject that have be start at dinner — the liberty and occupation of woman levin be of the opinion of darya alexandrovna that a girl who do not marry should find a woman ’s duty in a family he support this view by the fact that no family can get on without woman to help that in every family poor or rich there be and must be nurse either relation or hire " no " say kitty blush but look at he all the more boldly with her truthful eye " a girl may be so circumstanced that she can not live in the family without humiliation while she herself " at the hint he understand she " oh yes " he say " yes yes yes — you’re right you ’re right " and he see all that pestsov have be maintain at dinner of the liberty of woman simply from get a glimpse of the terror of an old maid ’s existence and its humiliation in kitty ’s heart and love she he feel that terror and humiliation and at once give up his argument a silence follow she be still draw with the chalk on the table her eye be shine with a soft light under the influence of her mood he feel in all his being a continually grow tension of happiness " ah I ’ve scribble all over the table " she say and lay down the chalk she make a movement as though to get up " what shall I be leave alone — without she " he think with horror and he take the chalk " wait a minute " he say sit down to the table " I ’ve long want to ask you one thing " he look straight into her caress though frightened eye " please ask it " " here " he say and he write the initial letter w y t m i c n b d t m n o t these letter mean " when you tell I it could never be do that mean never or then " there seem no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence but he look at she as though his life depend on she understand the word she glance at he seriously then lean her puckered brow on her hand and begin to read once or twice she steal a look at he as though ask he " be it what I think " " I understand " she say flush a little " what be this word " he say point to the n that stand for never " it mean never " she say " but that ’ not true " he quickly rub out what he have write give she the chalk and stand up she write t i c n a d dolly be completely comfort in the depression cause by her conversation with alexey alexandrovitch when she catch sight of the two figure kitty with the chalk in her hand with a shy and happy smile look upwards at levin and his handsome figure bend over the table with glow eye fasten one minute on the table and the next on she he be suddenly radiant he have understand it mean " then I could not answer differently " he glance at she questioningly timidly " only then " " yes " her smile answer " and n and now " he ask " well read this I ’ll tell you what I should like — should like so much " she write the initial letter i y c f a f w h this mean " if you could forget and forgive what happen " he snatch the chalk with nervous tremble finger and break it write the initial letter of the following phrase " I have nothing to forget and to forgive I have never cease to love you " she glance at he with a smile that do not waver " I understand " she say in a whisper he sit down and write a long phrase she understand it all and without ask he " be it this " take the chalk and at once answer for a long while he could not understand what she have write and often look into her eye he be stupefied with happiness he could not supply the word she have mean but in her charming eye beam with happiness he see all he need to know and he write three letter but he have hardly finish write when she read they over her arm and herself finish and write the answer " yes " " you ’re play secrétaire " say the old prince " but we must really be get along if you want to be in time at the theater " levin get up and escort kitty to the door in their conversation everything have be say it have be say that she love he and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning when kitty have go and levin be leave alone he feel such uneasiness without she and such an impatient longing to get as quickly as quickly as possible to tomorrow morning when he would see she again and be plight to she forever that he feel afraid as though of death of those fourteen hour that he have to get through without she it be essential for he to be with someone to talk to so as not to be leave alone to kill time stepan arkadyevitch would have be the companion most congenial to he but he be go out he say to a soirée in reality to the ballet levin only have time to tell he he be happy and that he love he and would never never forget what he have do for he the eye and the smile of stepan arkadyevitch show levin that he comprehend that feeling fittingly " oh so it ’ not time to die yet " say stepan arkadyevitch press levin ’s hand with emotion " nnno " say levin darya alexandrovna too as she say goodbye to he give he a sort of congratulation say " how glad I be you have meet kitty again one must value old friend " levin do not like these word of darya alexandrovna ’s she could not understand how lofty and beyond she it all be and she ought not to have dare to allude to it levin say goodbye to they but not to be leave alone he attach himself to his brother " where be you go " " I ’m go to a meeting " " well I ’ll come with you may I " " what for yes come along " say sergey ivanovitch smile " what be the matter with you today " " with I happiness be the matter with I " say levin let down the window of the carriage they be drive in " you do not mind — it ’ so stifling it ’s happiness be the matter with I why be it you have never marry " sergey ivanovitch smile " I be very glad she seem a nice gi " sergey ivanovitch be begin " do not say it do not say it " shout levin clutch at the collar of his fur coat with both hand and muffle he up in it " she ’ a nice girl " be such simple humble word so out of harmony with his feeling sergey ivanovitch laugh outright a merry laugh which be rare with he " well anyway I may say that I ’m very glad of it " " that you may do tomorrow tomorrow and nothing more nothing nothing silence " say levin and muffle he once more in his fur coat he add " I do like you so well be it possible for I to be present at the meeting " " of course it be " " what be your discussion about today " ask levin never cease smile they arrive at the meeting levin hear the secretary hesitatingly read the minute which he obviously do not himself understand but levin see from this secretary ’s face what a good nice kindhearted person he be this be evident from his confusion and embarrassment in read the minute then the discussion begin they be dispute about the misappropriation of certain sum and the laying of certain pipe and sergey ivanovitch be very cutting to two member and say something at great length with an air of triumph and another member scribble something on a bit of paper begin timidly at first but afterwards answer he very viciously and delightfully and then sviazhsky he be there too say something too very handsomely and nobly levin listen to they and see clearly that these miss sum and these pipe be not anything real and that they be not at all angry but be all the nice kind people and everything be as happy and charming as possible among they they do no harm to anyone and be all enjoy it what strike levin be that he could see through they all today and from little almost imperceptible sign know the soul of each and see distinctly that they be all good at heart and levin himself in particular they be all extremely fond of that day that be evident from the way they speak to he from the friendly affectionate way even those he do not know look at he " well do you like it " sergey ivanovitch ask he " very much I never suppose it be so interesting capital splendid " sviazhsky go up to levin and invite he to come round to tea with he levin be utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it be he have dislike in sviazhsky what he have fail to find in he he be a clever and wonderfully goodhearted man " most delighted " he say and ask after his wife and sisterinlaw and from a queer association of idea because in his imagination the idea of sviazhsky ’s sisterinlaw be connect with marriage it occur to he that there be no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness and he be very glad to go and see they sviazhsky question he about his improvement on his estate presuppose as he always do that there be no possibility of do anything not do already in europe and now this do not in the least annoy levin on the contrary he feel that sviazhsky be right that the whole business be of little value and he see the wonderful softness and consideration with which sviazhsky avoid fully express his correct view the lady of the sviazhsky household be particularly delightful it seem to levin that they know all about it already and sympathize with he say nothing merely from delicacy he stay with they one hour two three talk of all sort of subject but the one thing that fill his heart and do not observe that he be bore they

with alexey alexandrovitch vronsky go out onto the step of the karenins ' house and stand still with difficulty remember where he be and where he ought to walk or drive he feel disgraced humiliate guilty and deprive of all possibility of wash away his humiliation he feel thrust out of the beaten track along which he have so proudly and lightly walk till then all the habit and rule of his life that have seem so firm have turn out suddenly false and inapplicable the betray husband who have figure till that time as a pitiful creature an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness have suddenly be summon by she herself elevate to an aweinspiring pinnacle and on the pinnacle that husband have show himself not malignant not false not ludicrous but kind and straightforward and large vronsky could not but feel this and the part be suddenly reverse vronsky feel his elevation and his own abasement his truth and his own falsehood he feel that the husband be magnanimous even in his sorrow while he have be base and petty in his deceit but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he have unjustly despise make up only a small part of his misery he feel unutterably wretched now for his passion for anna which have seem to he of late to be grow cool now that he know he have lose she forever be strong than ever it have be he have see all of she in her illness have come to know her very soul and it seem to he that he have never love she till then and now when he have learn to know she to love she as she should be love he have be humiliate before she and have lose she forever leave with she nothing of himself but a shameful memory most terrible of all have be his ludicrous shameful position when alexey alexandrovitch have pull his hand away from his humiliated face he stand on the step of the karenins ' house like one distraught and do not know what to do " a sledge sir " ask the porter " yes a sledge " on get home after three sleepless night vronsky without undress lie down flat on the sofa clasp his hand and lay his head on they his head be heavy image memory and idea of the strange description follow one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness first it be the medicine he have pour out for the patient and spill over the spoon then the midwife ’s white hand then the queer posture of alexey alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed " to sleep to forget " he say to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he be tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head do begin to feel drowsy and he begin to drop off into forgetfulness the wave of the sea of unconsciousness have begin to meet over his head when all at once — it be as though a violent shock of electricity have pass over he he start so that he leap up on the spring of the sofa and lean on his arm get in a panic onto his knee his eye be wide open as though he have never be asleep the heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limb that he have feel a minute before have suddenly go " you may trample I in the mud " he hear alexey alexandrovitch ’s word and see he stand before he and see anna ’s face with its burn flush and glitter eye gaze with love and tenderness not at he but at alexey alexandrovitch he see his own as he fancy foolish and ludicrous figure when alexey alexandrovitch take his hand away from his face he stretch out his leg again and fling himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eye " to sleep to forget " he repeat to himself but with his eye shut he see more distinctly than ever anna ’s face as it have be on the memorable evening before the race " that be not and will not be and she want to wipe it out of her memory but I can not live without it how can we be reconcile how can we be reconcile " he say aloud and unconsciously begin to repeat these word this repetition check the rise up of fresh image and memory which he feel be throng in his brain but repeat word do not check his imagination for long again in extraordinarily rapid succession his good moment rise before his mind and then his recent humiliation " take away his hand " anna ’s voice say he take away his hand and feel the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face he still lie down try to sleep though he feel there be not the small hope of it and keep repeat stray word from some chain of thought try by this to check the rise flood of fresh image he listen and hear in a strange mad whisper word repeat " I do not appreciate it do not make enough of it I do not appreciate

the possibility that her repentance might be sincere and he might forgive she and she might not die — this mistake be two month after his return from moscow bring home to he in all its significance but the mistake make by he have arise not simply from his have overlook that contingency but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his die wife he have not know his own heart at his sick wife ’s bedside he have for the first time in his life give way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always rouse in he by the suffering of other and hitherto look on by he with shame as a harmful weakness and pity for she and remorse for have desire her death and most of all the joy of forgiveness make he at once conscious not simply of the relief of his own suffering but of a spiritual peace he have never experience before he suddenly feel that the very thing that be the source of his suffering have become the source of his spiritual joy that what have seem insoluble while

her mother ’s illness and would certainly have die if he have not trouble about she and he do not himself observe how fond he become of she he would go into the nursery several time a day and sit there for a long while so that the nurse who be at first afraid of he get quite used to his presence sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gaze at the saffronred downy wrinkled face of the sleep baby watch the movement of the frown brow and the fat little hand with clench finger that rub the little eye and nose at such moment particularly alexey alexandrovitch have a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony and see nothing extraordinary in his position nothing that ought to be change but as time go on he see more and more distinctly that however natural the position

servant who come in to send again for the doctor he feel vexed with his wife for not be anxious about this exquisite baby and in this vexed humor he have no wish to go to she he have no wish either to see princess betsy but his wife might wonder why he do not go to she as usual and so overcome his disinclination he go towards the bedroom as he walk over the soft rug towards the door he could not help overhear a conversation he do not want to hear " if he have not be go away I could have understand your answer and his too but your husband ought to be above that " betsy be say " it ’ not for my husband for myself I do not wish it do not say that " answer anna ’s excited voice " yes but you must care to say goodbye to a man who have shoot himself on your account " " that ’ just why I do not want to " with a dismayed and guilty expression alexey alexandrovitch stop and would have go back unobserved but reflect that this would be undignified he turn back again and clear his throat he go up to the bedroom the voice be silent and he go in anna in a gray dressing gown with a crop of short cluster black curl on her round head be sit on a settee the eagerness die out of her face as it always do at the sight of her husband she drop her head and look round uneasily at betsy betsy dress in the height of the late fashion in a hat that tower somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp in a blue dress with violet crossway stripe slant one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt be sit beside anna her tall flat figure hold erect bow her head she greet alexey alexandrovitch with an ironical smile " ah " she say as though surprised " I ’m very glad you ’re at home you never put in an appearance anywhere and I have not see you ever since anna have be ill I have hear all about it — your anxiety yes you ’re a wonderful husband " she say with a meaning and affable air as though she be bestow an order of magnanimity on he for his conduct to his wife alexey alexandrovitch bow frigidly and kiss his wife ’s hand ask how she be " well I think " she say avoid his eye " but you ’ve rather a feverishlooking color " he say lay stress on the word " feverish " " we ’ve be talk too much " say betsy " I feel it ’ selfishness on my part and I be go away " she get up but anna suddenly flush quickly catch at her hand " no wait a minute please I must tell you   no you " she turn to alexey alexandrovitch and her neck and brow be suffuse with crimson " I wo not and can not keep anything secret from you " she say alexey alexandrovitch crack his finger and bow his head " betsy ’ be tell I that count vronsky want to come here to say goodbye before his departure for tashkend " she do not look at her husband and be evidently in haste to have everything out however hard it might be for she " I tell she I could not receive he " " you say my dear that it would depend on alexey alexandrovitch " betsy correct she " oh no I can not receive he and what object would there " she stop suddenly and glance inquiringly at her husband he do not look at she " in short I do not wish it " alexey alexandrovitch advance and would have take her hand her first impulse be to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen vein that seek hers but with an obvious effort to control herself she press his hand " I be very grateful to you for your confidence but " he say feel with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself he could not discuss before princess tverskaya who to he stand for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control he in the life he lead in the eye of the world and hinder he from give way to his feeling of love and forgiveness he stop short look at princess tverskaya " well goodbye my darling " say betsy get up she kiss anna and go out alexey alexandrovitch escort she out " alexey alexandrovitch I know you be a truly magnanimous man " say betsy stop in the little drawingroom and with special warmth shake hand with he once more " I be an outsider but I so love she and respect you that I venture to advise receive he alexey vronsky be the soul of honor and he be go away to tashkend " " thank you princess for your sympathy and advice but the question of whether my wife can or can not see anyone she must decide herself " he say this from habit lift his brow with dignity and reflect immediately that whatever his word might be there could be no dignity in his position and he see this by the suppress malicious and ironical smile with which betsy glance at he after this phrase alexey alexandrovitch take leave of betsy in the drawingroom and go to his wife she be lie down but hear his step she sit up hastily in her former attitude and look in a scared way at he he see she have be cry " I be very grateful for your confidence in I " he repeat gently in russian the phrase he have say in betsy ’s presence in french and sit down beside she when he speak to she in russian use the russian " thou " of intimacy and affection it be insufferably irritating to anna " and I be very grateful for your decision I too imagine that since he be go away there be no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here however if " " but I ’ve say so already so why repeat it " anna suddenly interrupt he with an irritation she could not succeed in repress " no sort of necessity " she think " for a man to come and say goodbye to the woman he love for whom he be ready to ruin himself and have ruin himself and who can not live without he no sort of necessity " she compress her lip and drop her burn eye to his hand with their swollen vein they be rub each other " let we never speak of it " she add more calmly " I have leave this question to you to decide and I be very glad to see " alexey alexandrovitch be begin " that my wish coincide with your own " she finish quickly exasperated at his talk so slowly while she know beforehand all he would say " yes " he assent " and princess tverskaya ’s interference in the most difficult private affair be utterly uncalled for she especially " " I do not believe a word of what ’ say about she " say anna quickly " I know she really care for I " alexey alexandrovitch sigh and say nothing she play nervously with the tassel of her dressinggown glance at he with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blame herself though she could not control it her only desire now be to be rid of his oppressive presence " I have just send for the doctor " say alexey alexandrovitch " I be very well what do I want the doctor for " " no the little one cry and they say the nurse have not enough milk " " why do not you let I nurse she when I beg to anyway " alexey alexandrovitch know what be mean by that " anyway " " she ’ a baby and they ’re kill she " she ring the bell and order the baby to be bring she " I beg to nurse she I be not allow to and now I ’m blame for it " " I do not blame " " yes you do blame I my god why do not I die " and she break into sob " forgive I I ’m nervous I ’m unjust " she say control herself " but do go away " " no it can not go on like this " alexey alexandrovitch say to himself decidedly as he leave his wife ’s room never have the impossibility of his position in the world ’s eye and his wife ’s hatred of he and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guide his life against his spiritual inclination and exact conformity with its decree and change in his attitude to his wife be present to he with such distinctness as that day he see clearly that all the world and his wife expect of he something but what exactly he could not make out he feel that this be rouse in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement he believe that for anna herself it would be well to break off all relation with vronsky but if you all think this out of the question he be even ready to allow these relation to be renew so long as the child be not disgrace and he be not deprive of they nor force to change his position bad as this might be it be anyway well than a rupture which would put she in a hopeless and shameful position and deprive he of everything he care for but he feel helpless he know beforehand that everyone be against he and that he would not be allow to do what seem to he now so natural and right but would be force to do what be wrong though it seem the proper thing to they before betsy have time to walk out of the drawingroom she be meet in the doorway by stepan arkadyevitch who have just come from yeliseev ’ where a consignment of fresh oyster have be receive " ah princess what a delightful meeting " he begin " I ’ve be to see you " " a meeting for one minute for I ’m go " say betsy smile and put on her glove " do n’t put on your glove yet princess let I kiss your hand there ’ nothing I ’m so thankful to the revival of the old fashion for as the kiss the hand " he kiss betsy ’s hand " when shall we see each other " " you do not deserve it " answer betsy smile " oh yes I deserve a great deal for I ’ve become a most serious person I do not only manage my own affair but other people ’s too " he say with a significant expression " oh I ’m so glad " answer betsy at once understand that he be speak of anna and go back into the drawingroom they stand in a corner " he ’ kill she " say betsy in a whisper full of meaning " it ’ impossible impossible " " I ’m so glad you think so " say stepan arkadyevitch shake his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression " that ’ what I ’ve come to petersburg for " " the whole town ’ talk of it " she say " it ’ an impossible position she pine and pine away he do not understand that she ’ one of those woman who can not trifle with their feeling one of two thing either let he take she away act with energy or give she a divorce this be stifle she " " yes yes   just so " oblonsky say sigh " that ’ what I ’ve come for at least not solely for that   I ’ve be make a kammerherr of course one have to say thank you but the chief thing be have to settle this " " well god help you " say betsy after accompany betsy to the outside hall once more kiss her hand above the glove at the point where the pulse beat and murmur to she such unseemly nonsense that she do not know whether to laugh or be angry stepan arkadyevitch go to his sister he find she in tear although he happen to be bubble over with good spirit stepan arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fall into the sympathetic poetically emotional tone which harmonize with her mood he ask she how she be and how she have spend the morning " very very miserably today and this morning and all past day and day to come " she say " I think you ’re give way to pessimism you must rouse yourself you must look life in the face I know it ’ hard but " " I have hear it say that woman love man even for their vice " anna begin suddenly " but I hate he for his virtue I can not live with he do you understand the sight of he have a physical effect on I it make I beside myself I can not I can not live with he what be I to do I have be unhappy and use to think one could not be more unhappy but the awful state of thing I be go through now I could never have conceive would you believe it that know he ’ a good man a splendid man that I ’m not worth his little finger still I hate he I hate he for his generosity and there ’ nothing leave for I but " she would have say death but stepan arkadyevitch would not let she finish " you be ill and overwrought " he say " believe I you ’re exaggerate dreadfully there ’ nothing so terrible in it " and stepan arkadyevitch smile no one else in stepan arkadyevitch ’s place have to do with such despair would have venture to smile the smile would have seem brutal but in his smile there be so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile do not wound but soften and soothe his gentle soothe word and smile be as soothing and soften as almond oil and anna soon feel this " no stiva " she say " I ’m lose lose worse than lose I can not say yet that all be over on the contrary I feel that it ’ not over I ’m an overstrained string that must snap but it ’ not end yet   and it will have a fearful end " " no matter we must let the string be loosen little by little there ’ no position from which there be no way of escape " " I have think and think only one " again he know from her terrified eye that this one way of escape in her thought be death and he would not let she say it " not at all " he say " listen to I you can not see your own position as I can let I tell you candidly my opinion " again he smile discreetly his almondoil smile " I ’ll begin from the beginning you marry a man twenty year old than yourself you marry he without love and not know what love be it be a mistake let ’s admit " " a fearful mistake " say anna " but I repeat it ’ an accomplished fact then you have let we say the misfortune to love a man not your husband that be a misfortune but that too be an accomplished fact and your husband know it and forgive it " he stop at each sentence wait for she to object but she make no answer " that ’ so now the question be can you go on live with your husband do you wish it do he wish it " " I know nothing nothing " " but you say yourself that you can not endure he " " no I do not say so I deny it I can not tell I do not know anything about it " " yes but let " " you can not understand I feel I ’m lie head downwards in a sort of pit but I ought not to save myself and I can not " " never mind we ’ll slip something under and pull you out I understand you I understand that you can not take it on yourself to express your wish your feeling " " there ’ nothing nothing I wish   except for it to be all over " " but he see this and know it and do you suppose it weigh on he any less than on you you ’re wretched he ’ wretched and what good can come of it while divorce would solve the difficulty completely " with some effort stepan arkadyevitch bring out his central idea and look significantly at she she say nothing and shake her cropped head in dissent but from the look in her face that suddenly brighten into its old beauty he see that if she do not desire this it be simply because it seem to she unattainable happiness " I ’m awfully sorry for you and how happy I should be if I could arrange thing " say stepan arkadyevitch smile more boldly " do not speak do not say a word god grant only that I may speak as I feel I ’m go to he " anna look at he with dreamy shine eye and say nothing stepan arkadyevitch with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he use to take his presidential chair at his board walk into alexey alexandrovitch ’s room alexey alexandrovitch be walk about his room with his hand behind his back think of just what stepan arkadyevitch have be discuss with his wife " I ’m not interrupt you " say stepan arkadyevitch on the sight of his brotherinlaw become suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with he to conceal this embarrassment he take out a cigarette case he have just buy that open in a new way and sniff the leather take a cigarette out of it " no do you want anything " alexey alexandrovitch ask without eagerness " yes I wish   I want   yes I want to talk to you " say stepan arkadyevitch with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity this feeling be so unexpected and so strange that he do not believe it be the voice of conscience tell he that what he be mean to do be wrong stepan arkadyevitch make an effort and struggle with the timidity that have come over he " I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you " he say redden alexey alexandrovitch stand still and say nothing but his face strike stepan arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice " I intend   I want to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position " he say still struggle with an unaccustomed constraint alexey alexandrovitch smile mournfully look at his brotherinlaw and without answer go up to the table take from it an unfinished letter and hand it to his brotherinlaw " I think unceasingly of the same thing and here be what I have begin write think I could say it well by letter and that my presence irritate she " he say as he give he the letter stepan arkadyevitch take the letter look with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eye fix so immovably on he and begin to read " I see that my presence be irksome to you painful as it be to I to believe it I see that it be so and can not be otherwise I do not blame you and god be my witness that on see you at the time of your illness I resolve with my whole heart to forget all that have pass between we and to begin a new life I do not regret and shall never regret what I have do but I have desire one thing — your good the good of your soul — and now I see I have not attain that tell I yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul I put myself entirely in your hand and trust to your feeling of what ’ right " stepan arkadyevitch hand back the letter and with the same surprise continue look at his brotherinlaw not know what to say this silence be so awkward for both of they that stepan arkadyevitch ’s lip begin twitch nervously while he still gaze without speak at karenin ’s face " that ’ what I want to say to she " say alexey alexandrovitch turn away " yes yes " say stepan arkadyevitch not able to answer for the tear that be choke he " yes yes I understand you " he bring out at last " I want to know what she would like " say alexey alexandrovitch " I be afraid she do not understand her own position she be not a judge " say stepan arkadyevitch recover himself " she be crush simply crush by your generosity if she be to read this letter she would be incapable of say anything she would only hang her head low than ever " " yes but what ’ to be do in that case how explain how find out her wish " " if you will allow I to give my opinion I think that it lie with you to point out directly the step you consider necessary to end the position " " so you consider it must be end " alexey alexandrovitch interrupt he " but how " he add with a gesture of his hand before his eye not usual with he " I see no possible way out of it " " there be some way of get out of every position " say stepan arkadyevitch stand up and become more cheerful " there be a time when you think of break off if you be convince now that you can not make each other happy " " happiness may be variously understand but suppose that I agree to everything that I want nothing what way be there of get out of our position " " if you care to know my opinion " say stepan arkadyevitch with the same smile of soften almondoil tenderness with which he have be talk to anna his kindly smile be so winning that alexey alexandrovitch feel his own weakness and unconsciously sway by it be ready to believe what stepan arkadyevitch be say " she will never speak out about it but one thing be possible one thing she might desire " he go on " that be the cessation of your relation and all memory associate with they to my thinking in your position what ’ essential be the formation of a new attitude to one another and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both side " " divorce " alexey alexandrovitch interrupt in a tone of aversion " yes I imagine that divorce — yes divorce " stepan arkadyevitch repeat redden " that be from every point of view the most rational course for marry people who find themselves in the position you be in what can be do if married people find that life be impossible for they together that may always happen " alexey alexandrovitch sigh heavily and close his eye " there ’ only one point to be consider be either of the party desirous of form new tie if not it be very simple " say stepan arkadyevitch feel more and more free from constraint alexey alexandrovitch scowl with emotion mutter something to himself and make no answer all that seem so simple to stepan arkadyevitch alexey alexandrovitch have think over thousand of time and so far from be simple it all seem to he utterly impossible divorce the detail of which he know by this time seem to he now out of the question because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbid his take upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery and still more suffering his wife pardon and belove by he to be catch in the fact and put to public shame divorce appear to he impossible also on other still more weighty ground what would become of his son in case of a divorce to leave he with his mother be out of the question the divorce mother would have her own illegitimate family in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good keep he with he he know that would be an act of vengeance on his part and that he do not want but apart from this what more than all make divorce seem impossible to alexey alexandrovitch be that by consent to a divorce he would be completely ruin anna the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow that in decide on a divorce he be think of himself and not consider that by this he would be ruin she irrevocably have sink into his heart and connect this saying with his forgiveness of she with his devotion to the child he understand it now in his own way to consent to a divorce to give she her freedom mean in his thought to take from himself the last tie that bind he to life — the child whom he love and to take from she the last prop that stay she on the path of right to thrust she down to her ruin if she be divorce he know she would join her life to vronsky ’s and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one since a wife by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law could not marry while her husband be live " she will join he and in a year or two he will throw she over or she will form a new tie " think alexey alexandrovitch " and I by agree to an unlawful divorce shall be to blame for her ruin " he have think it all over hundred of time and be convince that a divorce be not at all simple as stepan arkadyevitch have say but be utterly impossible he do not believe a single word stepan arkadyevitch say to he to every word he have a thousand objection to make but he listen to he feel that his word be the expression of that mighty brutal force which control his life and to which he would have to submit " the only question be on what term you agree to give she a divorce she do not want anything do not dare ask you for anything she leave it all to your generosity " " my god my god what for " think alexey alexandrovitch remember the detail of divorce proceeding in which the husband take the blame on himself and with just the same gesture with which vronsky have do the same he hide his face for shame in his hand " you be distressed I understand that but if you think it over " " whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to he the other also and if any man take away thy coat let he have thy cloak also " think alexey alexandrovitch   " yes yes " he cry in a shrill voice " I will take the disgrace on myself I will give up even my son but   but would not it be well to let it alone still you may do as you like "   and turn away so that his brotherinlaw could not see he he sit down on a chair at the window there be bitterness there be shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he feel joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness   stepan arkadyevitch be touch he be silent for a space   " alexey alexandrovitch believe I she appreciate your generosity " he say " but it seem it be the will of god " he add and as he say it feel how foolish a remark it be and with difficulty repress a smile at his own foolishness   alexey alexandrovitch would have make some reply but tear stop he   " this be an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and be do my good to help both she and you " say stepan arkadyevitch   when he go
