 happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way everything was in confusion in the oblonskys’ house the wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a french girl who had been a governess in their family and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him this position of affairs had now lasted three days and not only the husband and wife themselves but all the members of their family and household were painfully conscious of it every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they the members of the family and household of the oblonskys the wife did not leave her own room the husband had not been at home for three days the children ran wild all over the house the english governess quarreled with the housekeeper and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her the mancook had walked off the day before just at dinner time the kitchenmaid and the coachman had given warning three days after the quarrel prince stepan arkadyevitch oblonsky—stiva as he was called in the fashionable world—woke up at his usual hour that is at eight o’clock in the morning not in his wife’s bedroom but on the leathercovered sofa in his study he turned over his stout wellcaredfor person on the springy sofa as though he would sink into a long sleep again he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it but all at once he jumped up sat up on the sofa and opened his eyes “yes yes how was it now” he thought going over his dream “now how was it to be sure alabin was giving a dinner at darmstadt no not darmstadt but something american yes but then darmstadt was in america yes alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables and the tables sang il mio tesoro—not il mio tesoro though but something better and there were some sort of little decanters on the table and they were women too” he remembered stepan arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily and he pondered with a smile “yes it was nice very nice there was a great deal more that was delightful only there’s no putting it into words or even expressing it in one’s thoughts awake” and noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa and felt about with them for his slippers a present on his last birthday worked for him by his wife on goldcolored morocco and as he had done every day for the last nine years he stretched out his hand without getting up towards the place where his dressinggown always hung in his bedroom and thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife’s room but in his study and why the smile vanished from his face he knitted his brows “ah ah ah oo” he muttered recalling everything that had happened and again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination all the hopelessness of his position and worst of all his own fault “yes she won’t forgive me and she can’t forgive me and the most awful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault though i’m not to blame that’s the point of the whole situation” he reflected “oh oh oh” he kept repeating in despair as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel most unpleasant of all was the first minute when on coming happy and goodhumored from the theater with a huge pear in his hand for his wife he had not found his wife in the drawingroom to his surprise had not found her in the study either and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand she his dolly forever fussing and worrying over household details and limited in her ideas as he considered was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand looking at him with an expression of horror despair and indignation “what’s this this” she asked pointing to the letter and at this recollection stepan arkadyevitch as is so often the case was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wife’s words there happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful he did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault instead of being hurt denying defending himself begging forgiveness instead of remaining indifferent even—anything would have been better than what he did do—his face utterly involuntarily reflex spinal action reflected stepan arkadyevitch who was fond of physiology—utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual goodhumored and therefore idiotic smile this idiotic smile he could not forgive himself catching sight of that smile dolly shuddered as though at physical pain broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words and rushed out of the room since then she had refused to see her husband “it’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all” thought stepan arkadyevitch “but what’s to be done what’s to be done” he said to himself in despair and found no answer stepan arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself he was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his conduct he could not at this date repent of the fact that he a handsome susceptible man of thirtyfour was not in love with his wife the mother of five living and two dead children and only a year younger than himself all he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife but he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife his children and himself possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her he had never clearly thought out the subject but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her and shut her eyes to the fact he had even supposed that she a wornout woman no longer young or goodlooking and in no way remarkable or interesting merely a good mother ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view it had turned out quite the other way “oh it’s awful oh dear oh dear awful” stepan arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself and he could think of nothing to be done “and how well things were going up till now how well we got on she was contented and happy in her children i never interfered with her in anything i let her manage the children and the house just as she liked it’s true it’s bad her having been a governess in our house that’s bad there’s something common vulgar in flirting with one’s governess but what a governess” he vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of mlle roland and her smile “but after all while she was in the house i kept myself in hand and the worst of it all is that she’s already  it seems as if illluck would have it so oh oh but what what is to be done” there was no solution but that universal solution which life gives to all questions even the most complex and insoluble that answer is one must live in the needs of the day—that is forget oneself to forget himself in sleep was impossible now at least till nighttime he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanterwomen so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life “then we shall see” stepan arkadyevitch said to himself and getting up he put on a gray dressinggown lined with blue silk tied the tassels in a knot and drawing a deep breath of air into his broad bare chest he walked to the window with his usual confident step turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily he pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly it was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend his valet matvey carrying his clothes his boots and a telegram matvey was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving “are there any papers from the office” asked stepan arkadyevitch taking the telegram and seating himself at the lookingglass “on the table” replied matvey glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master and after a short pause he added with a sly smile “they’ve sent from the carriagejobbers” stepan arkadyevitch made no reply he merely glanced at matvey in the lookingglass in the glance in which their eyes met in the lookingglass it was clear that they understood one another stepan arkadyevitch’s eyes asked “why do you tell me that don’t you know” matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets thrust out one leg and gazed silently goodhumoredly with a faint smile at his master “i told them to come on sunday and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing” he said he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand stepan arkadyevitch saw matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself tearing open the telegram he read it through guessing at the words misspelt as they always are in telegrams and his face brightened “matvey my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow” he said checking for a minute the sleek plump hand of the barber cutting a pink path through his long curly whiskers “thank god” said matvey showing by this response that he like his master realized the significance of this arrival—that is that anna arkadyevna the sister he was so fond of might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife “alone or with her husband” inquired matvey stepan arkadyevitch could not answer as the barber was at work on his upper lip and he raised one finger matvey nodded at the lookingglass “alone is the room to be got ready upstairs” “inform darya alexandrovna where she orders” “darya alexandrovna” matvey repeated as though in doubt “yes inform her here take the telegram give it to her and then do what she tells you” “you want to try it on” matvey understood but he only said “yes sir” stepan arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed when matvey stepping deliberately in his creaky boots came back into the room with the telegram in his hand the barber had gone “darya alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away let him do—that is you—as he likes” he said laughing only with his eyes and putting his hands in his pockets he watched his master with his head on one side stepan arkadyevitch was silent a minute then a goodhumored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face “eh matvey” he said shaking his head “it’s all right sir she will come round” said matvey “come round” “yes sir” “do you think so who’s there” asked stepan arkadyevitch hearing the rustle of a woman’s dress at the door “it’s i” said a firm pleasant woman’s voice and the stern pockmarked face of matrona philimonovna the nurse was thrust in at the doorway “well what is it matrona” queried stepan arkadyevitch going up to her at the door although stepan arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife and was conscious of this himself almost everyone in the house even the nurse darya alexandrovna’s chief ally was on his side “well what now” he asked disconsolately “go to her sir own your fault again maybe god will aid you she is suffering so it’s sad to see her and besides everything in the house is topsyturvy you must have pity sir on the children beg her forgiveness sir there’s no help for it one must take the consequences” “but she won’t see me” “you do your part god is merciful pray to god sir pray to god” “come that’ll do you can go” said stepan arkadyevitch blushing suddenly “well now do dress me” he turned to matvey and threw off his dressinggown decisively matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse’s collar and blowing off some invisible speck he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the wellgroomed body of his master when he was dressed stepan arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself pulled down his shirtcuffs distributed into his pockets his cigarettes pocketbook matches and watch with its double chain and seals and shaking out his handkerchief feeling himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his unhappiness he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the diningroom where coffee was already waiting for him and beside the coffee letters and papers from the office he read the letters one was very unpleasant from a merchant who was buying a forest on his wife’s property to sell this forest was absolutely essential but at present until he was reconciled with his wife the subject could not be discussed the most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be led on by his interests that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest—that idea hurt him when he had finished his letters stepan arkadyevitch moved the officepapers close to him rapidly looked through two pieces of business made a few notes with a big pencil and pushing away the papers turned to his coffee as he sipped his coffee he opened a still damp morning paper and began reading it stepan arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocating the views held by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politics had no special interest for him he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper and he only changed them when the majority changed them—or more strictly speaking he did not change them but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him stepan arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat but simply took those that were being worn and for him living in a certain society—owing to the need ordinarily developed at years of discretion for some degree of mental activity—to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat if there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views which were held also by many of his circle it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life the liberal party said that in russia everything is wrong and certainly stepan arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money the liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date and that it needs reconstruction and family life certainly afforded stepan arkadyevitch little gratification and forced him into lying and hypocrisy which was so repulsive to his nature the liberal party said or rather allowed it to be understood that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people and stepan arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs aching from standing up and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and highflown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevitch who liked a joke was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he prided himself on his origin he ought not to stop at rurik and disown the first founder of his family—the monkey and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevitch’s and he liked his newspaper as he did his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffused in his brain he read the leading article in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary “in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress” etc etc he read another article too a financial one which alluded to bentham and mill and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry with his characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo divined whence it came at whom and on what ground it was aimed and that afforded him as it always did a certain satisfaction but today that satisfaction was embittered by matrona philimonovna’s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household he read too that count beist was rumored to have left for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seeking a situation but these items of information did not give him as usual a quiet ironical gratification having finished the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he got up shaking the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat and squaring his broad chest he smiled joyously not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind—the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion but this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him and he grew thoughtful two childish voices stepan arkadyevitch recognized the voices of grisha his youngest boy and tanya his eldest girl were heard outside the door they were carrying something and dropped it “i told you not to sit passengers on the roof” said the little girl in english “there pick them up” “everything’s in confusion” thought stepan arkadyevitch “there are the children running about by themselves” and going to the door he called them they threw down the box that represented a train and came in to their father the little girl her father’s favorite ran up boldly embraced him and hung laughingly on his neck enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers at last the little girl kissed his face which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness loosed her hands and was about to run away again but her father held her back “how is mamma” he asked passing his hand over his daughter’s smooth soft little neck “good morning” he said smiling to the boy who had come up to greet him he was conscious that he loved the boy less and always tried to be fair but the boy felt it and did not respond with a smile to his father’s chilly smile “mamma she is up” answered the girl stepan arkadyevitch sighed “that means that she’s not slept again all night” he thought “well is she cheerful” the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly and she blushed for her father he at once perceived it and blushed too “i don’t know” she said “she did not say we must do our lessons but she said we were to go for a walk with miss hoole to grandmamma’s” “well go tanya my darling oh wait a minute though” he said still holding her and stroking her soft little hand he took off the mantelpiece where he had put it yesterday a little box of sweets and gave her two picking out her favorites a chocolate and a fondant “for grisha” said the little girl pointing to the chocolate “yes yes” and still stroking her little shoulder he kissed her on the roots of her hair and neck and let her go “the carriage is ready” said matvey “but there’s someone to see you with a petition” “been here long” asked stepan arkadyevitch “half an hour” “how many times have i told you to tell me at once” “one must let you drink your coffee in peace at least” said matvey in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry “well show the person up at once” said oblonsky frowning with vexation the petitioner the widow of a staff captain kalinin came with a request impossible and unreasonable but stepan arkadyevitch as he generally did made her sit down heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply and even wrote her in his large sprawling good and legible hand a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to her having got rid of the staff captain’s widow stepan arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything it appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget—his wife “ah yes” he bowed his head and his handsome face assumed a harassed expression “to go or not to go” he said to himself and an inner voice told him he must not go that nothing could come of it but falsity that to amend to set right their relations was impossible because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love or to make him an old man not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature “it must be some time though it can’t go on like this” he said trying to give himself courage he squared his chest took out a cigarette took two whiffs at it flung it into a motherofpearl ashtray and with rapid steps walked through the drawingroom and opened the other door into his wife’s bedroom darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty once luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eyes which looked prominent from the thinness of her face was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room before an open bureau from which she was taking something hearing her husband’s steps she stopped looking towards the door and trying assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days—to sort out the children’s things and her own so as to take them to her mother’s—and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself “that things cannot go on like this that she must take some step” to punish him put him to shame avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and loving him besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with them all as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but cheating herself she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her but her face to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression betrayed bewilderment and suffering “dolly” he said in a subdued and timid voice he bent his head towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health in a rapid glance she scanned his figure that beamed with health and freshness “yes he is happy and content” she thought “while i and that disgusting good nature which everyone likes him for and praises—i hate that good nature of his” she thought her mouth stiffened the muscles of the cheek contracted on the right side of her pale nervous face “what do you want” she said in a rapid deep unnatural voice “dolly” he repeated with a quiver in his voice “anna is coming today” “well what is that to me i can’t see her” she cried “but you must really dolly” “go away go away go away” she shrieked not looking at him as though this shriek were called up by physical pain stepan arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife he could hope that she would come round as matvey expressed it and could quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee but when he saw her tortured suffering face heard the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair there was a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat and his eyes began to shine with tears “my god what have i done dolly for god’s sake you know” he could not go on there was a sob in his throat she shut the bureau with a slam and glanced at him “dolly what can i say one thing forgive remember cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant” she dropped her eyes and listened expecting what he would say as it were beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently “—instant of passion” he said and would have gone on but at that word as at a pang of physical pain her lips stiffened again and again the muscles of her right cheek worked “go away go out of the room” she shrieked still more shrilly “and don’t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness” she tried to go out but tottered and clung to the back of a chair to support herself his face relaxed his lips swelled his eyes were swimming with tears “dolly” he said sobbing now “for mercy’s sake think of the children they are not to blame i am to blame and punish me make me expiate my fault anything i can do i am ready to do anything i am to blame no words can express how much i am to blame but dolly forgive me” she sat down he listened to her hard heavy breathing and he was unutterably sorry for her she tried several times to begin to speak but could not he waited “you remember the children stiva to play with them but i remember them and know that this means their ruin” she said—obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last few days she had called him “stiva” and he glanced at her with gratitude and moved to take her hand but she drew back from him with aversion “i think of the children and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them but i don’t myself know how to save them by taking them away from their father or by leaving them with a vicious father—yes a vicious father tell me after what  has happened can we live together is that possible tell me eh is it possible” she repeated raising her voice “after my husband the father of my children enters into a love affair with his own children’s governess” “but what could i do what could i do” he kept saying in a pitiful voice not knowing what he was saying as his head sank lower and lower “you are loathsome to me repulsive” she shrieked getting more and more heated “your tears mean nothing you have never loved me you have neither heart nor honorable feeling you are hateful to me disgusting a stranger—yes a complete stranger” with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself—stranger he looked at her and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him he did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her she saw in him sympathy for her but not love “no she hates me she will not forgive me” he thought “it is awful awful” he said at that moment in the next room a child began to cry probably it had fallen down darya alexandrovna listened and her face suddenly softened she seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds as though she did not know where she was and what she was doing and getting up rapidly she moved towards the door “well she loves my child” he thought noticing the change of her face at the child’s cry “my child how can she hate me” “dolly one word more” he said following her “if you come near me i will call in the servants the children they may all know you are a scoundrel i am going away at once and you may live here with your mistress” and she went out slamming the door stepan arkadyevitch sighed wiped his face and with a subdued tread walked out of the room “matvey says she will come round but how i don’t see the least chance of it ah oh how horrible it is and how vulgarly she shouted” he said to himself remembering her shriek and the words—“scoundrel” and “mistress” “and very likely the maids were listening horribly vulgar horrible” stepan arkadyevitch stood a few seconds alone wiped his face squared his chest and walked out of the room it was friday and in the diningroom the german watchmaker was winding up the clock stepan arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this punctual bald watchmaker “that the german was wound up for a whole lifetime himself to wind up watches” and he smiled stepan arkadyevitch was fond of a joke “and maybe she will come round that’s a good expression ‘come round’” he thought “i must repeat that” “matvey” he shouted “arrange everything with darya in the sitting room for anna arkadyevna” he said to matvey when he came in “yes sir” stepan arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps “you won’t dine at home” said matvey seeing him off “that’s as it happens but here’s for the housekeeping” he said taking ten roubles from his pocketbook “that’ll be enough” “enough or not enough we must make it do” said matvey slamming the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps darya alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off went back again to her bedroom it was her solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it even now in the short time she had been in the nursery the english governess and matrona philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her which did not admit of delay and which only she could answer “what were the children to put on for their walk should they have any milk should not a new cook be sent for” “ah let me alone let me alone” she said and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to her husband clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that slipped down on her bony fingers and fell to going over in her memory all the conversation “he has gone but has he broken it off with her” she thought “can it be he sees her why didn’t i ask him no no reconciliation is impossible even if we remain in the same house we are strangers—strangers forever” she repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her “and how i loved him my god how i loved him how i loved him and now don’t i love him don’t i love him more than before the most horrible thing is” she began but did not finish her thought because matrona philimonovna put her head in at the door “let us send for my brother” she said “he can get a dinner anyway or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again like yesterday” “very well i will come directly and see about it but did you send for some new milk” and darya alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day and drowned her grief in them for a time stepan arkadyevitch had learned easily at school thanks to his excellent abilities but he had been idle and mischievous and therefore was one of the lowest in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at moscow this post he had received through his sister anna’s husband alexey alexandrovitch karenin who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to whose department the moscow office belonged but if karenin had not got his brotherinlaw this berth then through a hundred other personages—brothers sisters cousins uncles and aunts—stiva oblonsky would have received this post or some other similar one together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him as his affairs in spite of his wife’s considerable property were in an embarrassed condition half moscow and petersburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevitch he was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world onethird of the men in the government the older men had been friends of his father’s and had known him in petticoats another third were his intimate chums and the remainder were friendly acquaintances consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of places rents shares and such were all his friends and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he had only not to refuse things not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did it would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required especially as he expected nothing out of the way he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man stepan arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor but for his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in him in his handsome radiant figure his sparkling eyes black hair and eyebrows and the white and red of his face there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him “aha stiva oblonsky here he is” was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened the next day and the next everyone was just as delighted at meeting him again after filling for three years the post of president of one of the government boards at moscow stepan arkadyevitch had won the respect as well as the liking of his fellowofficials subordinates and superiors and all who had had business with him the principal qualities in stepan arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted in the first place of his extreme indulgence for others founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings secondly of his perfect liberalism—not the liberalism he read of in the papers but the liberalism that was in his blood in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or calling might be and thirdly—the most important point—his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged in consequence of which he was never carried away and never made mistakes on reaching the offices of the board stepan arkadyevitch escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio went into his little private room put on his uniform and went into the boardroom the clerks and copyists all rose greeting him with goodhumored deference stepan arkadyevitch moved quickly as ever to his place shook hands with his colleagues and sat down he made a joke or two and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum and began work no one knew better than stepan arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom simplicity and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the goodhumored deference common to everyone in stepan arkadyevitch’s office came up with papers and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevitch “we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza here would you care” “you’ve got them at last” said stepan arkadyevitch laying his finger on the paper “now gentlemen” and the sitting of the board began “if they knew” he thought bending his head with a significant air as he listened to the report “what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago” and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report till two o’clock the sitting would go on without a break and at two o’clock there would be an interval and luncheon it was not yet two when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened and someone came in all the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the tsar and the eagle delighted at any distraction looked round at the door but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the intruder and closed the glass door after him when the case had been read through stepan arkadyevitch got up and stretched and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room two of the members of the board the old veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevitch went in with him “we shall have time to finish after lunch” said stepan arkadyevitch “to be sure we shall” said nikitin “a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be” said grinevitch of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining stepan arkadyevitch frowned at grinevitch’s words giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely and made him no reply “who was that came in” he asked the doorkeeper “someone your excellency crept in without permission directly my back was turned he was asking for you i told him when the members come out then” “where is he” “maybe he’s gone into the passage but here he comes anyway that is he” said the doorkeeper pointing to a strongly built broadshouldered man with a curly beard who without taking off his sheepskin cap was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase one of the members going down—a lean official with a portfolio—stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky stepan arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs his goodnaturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up “why it’s actually you levin at last” he said with a friendly mocking smile scanning levin as he approached “how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den” said stepan arkadyevitch and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend “have you been here long” “i have just come and very much wanted to see you” said levin looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around “well let’s go into my room” said stepan arkadyevitch who knew his friend’s sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers stepan arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of sixty boys of twenty actors ministers merchants and adjutantgenerals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish the disagreeable impression made on them levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his subordinates and so he made haste to take him off into his room levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them—as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds—though in discussion he would even justify the other’s career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevitch could never quite make out and indeed he took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevitch laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky as he was doing the same as everyone did laughed complacently and goodhumoredly while levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily “we have long been expecting you” said stepan arkadyevitch going into his room and letting levin’s hand go as though to show that here all danger was over “i am very very glad to see you” he went on “well how are you eh when did you come” levin was silent looking at the unknown faces of oblonsky’s two companions and especially at the hand of the elegant grinevitch which had such long white fingers such long yellow filbertshaped nails and such huge shining studs on the shirtcuff that apparently they absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled “ah to be sure let me introduce you” he said “my colleagues philip ivanitch nikitin mihail stanislavitch grinevitch”—and turning to levin—“a district councilor a modern district councilman a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand a cattlebreeder and sportsman and my friend konstantin dmitrievitch levin the brother of sergey ivanovitch koznishev” “delighted” said the veteran “i have the honor of knowing your brother sergey ivanovitch” said grinevitch holding out his slender hand with its long nails levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his halfbrother an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as konstantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev “no i am no longer a district councilor i have quarreled with them all and don’t go to the meetings any more” he said turning to oblonsky “you’ve been quick about it” said oblonsky with a smile “but how why” “it’s a long story i will tell you some time” said levin but he began telling him at once “well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils or ever could be” he began as though someone had just insulted him “on one side it’s a plaything they play at being a parliament and i’m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side” he stammered “it’s a means for the coterie of the district to make money formerly they had wardships courts of justice now they have the district council—not in the form of bribes but in the form of unearned salary” he said as hotly as though someone of those present had opposed his opinion “aha you’re in a new phase again i see—a conservative” said stepan arkadyevitch “however we can go into that later” “yes later but i wanted to see you” said levin looking with hatred at grinevitch’s hand stepan arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile “how was it you used to say you would never wear european dress again” he said scanning his new suit obviously cut by a french tailor “ah i see a new phase” levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him “oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you” said levin oblonsky seemed to ponder “i’ll tell you what let’s go to gurin’s to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three” “no” answered levin after an instant’s thought “i have got to go on somewhere else” “all right then let’s dine together” “dine together but i have nothing very particular only a few words to say and a question i want to ask you and we can have a talk afterwards” “well say the few words then at once and we’ll gossip after dinner” “well it’s this” said levin “but it’s of no importance though” his face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness “what are the shtcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be” he said stepan arkadyevitch who had long known that levin was in love with his sisterinlaw kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily “you said a few words but i can’t answer in a few words because excuse me a minute” a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevitch without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the secretary’s sleeve “no you do as i told you” he said softening his words with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away from the papers and said “so do it that way if you please zahar nikititch” the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention “i don’t understand it i don’t understand it” he said “what don’t you understand” said oblonsky smiling as brightly as ever and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin “i don’t understand what you are doing” said levin shrugging his shoulders “how can you do it seriously” “why not” “why because there’s nothing in it” “you think so but we’re overwhelmed with work” “on paper but there you’ve a gift for it” added levin “that’s to say you think there’s a lack of something in me” “perhaps so” said levin “but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud that i’ve a friend in such a great person you’ve not answered my question though” he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face “oh that’s all very well you wait a bit and you’ll come to this yourself it’s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still you’ll be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but it’s a pity you’ve been away so long” “oh why so” levin queried panicstricken “oh nothing” responded oblonsky “we’ll talk it over but what’s brought you up to town” “oh we’ll talk about that too later on” said levin reddening again up to his ears “all right i see” said stepan arkadyevitch “i should ask you to come to us you know but my wife’s not quite the thing but i tell you what if you want to see them they’re sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and i’ll come and fetch you and we’ll go and dine somewhere together” “capital so goodbye till then” “now mind you’ll forget i know you or rush off home to the country” stepan arkadyevitch called out laughing “no truly” and levin went out of the room only when he was in the doorway remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of oblonsky’s colleagues “that gentleman must be a man of great energy” said grinevitch when levin had gone away “yes my dear boy” said stepan arkadyevitch nodding his head “he’s a lucky fellow over six thousand acres in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us” “you have a great deal to complain of haven’t you stepan arkadyevitch” “ah yes i’m in a poor way a bad way” said stepan arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh when oblonsky asked levin what had brought him to town levin blushed and was furious with himself for blushing because he could not answer “i have come to make your sisterinlaw an offer” though that was precisely what he had come for the families of the levins and the shtcherbatskys were old noble moscow families and had always been on intimate and friendly terms this intimacy had grown still closer during levin’s student days he had both prepared for the university with the young prince shtcherbatsky the brother of kitty and dolly and had entered at the same time with him in those days levin used often to be in the shtcherbatskys’ house and he was in love with the shtcherbatsky household strange as it may appear it was with the household the family that konstantin levin was in love especially with the feminine half of the household levin did not remember his own mother and his only sister was older than he was so that it was in the shtcherbatskys’ house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old noble cultivated and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father and mother all the members of that family especially the feminine half were pictured by him as it were wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak french and the next english why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano the sounds of which were audible in their brother’s room above where the students used to work why they were visited by those professors of french literature of music of drawing of dancing why at certain hours all the three young ladies with mademoiselle linon drove in the coach to the tversky boulevard dressed in their satin cloaks dolly in a long one natalia in a halflong one and kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightlydrawn red stockings were visible to all beholders why it was they had to walk about the tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat—all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings in his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest dolly but she was soon married to oblonsky then he began being in love with the second he felt as it were that he had to be in love with one of the sisters only he could not quite make out which but natalia too had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat lvov kitty was still a child when levin left the university young shtcherbatsky went into the navy was drowned in the baltic and levin’s relations with the shtcherbatskys in spite of his friendship with oblonsky became less intimate but when early in the winter of this year levin came to moscow after a year in the country and saw the shtcherbatskys he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love one would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him a man of good family rather rich than poor and thirtytwo years old to make the young princess shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match but levin was in love and so it seemed to him that kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her after spending two months in moscow in a state of enchantment seeing kitty almost every day in society into which he went so as to meet her he abruptly decided that it could not be and went back to the country levin’s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming kitty and that kitty herself could not love him in her family’s eyes he had no ordinary definite career and position in society while his contemporaries by this time when he was thirtytwo were already one a colonel and another a professor another director of a bank and railways or president of a board like oblonsky but he he knew very well how he must appear to others was a country gentleman occupied in breeding cattle shooting game and building barns in other words a fellow of no ability who had not turned out well and who was doing just what according to the ideas of the world is done by people fit for nothing else the mysterious enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be and above all such an ordinary in no way striking person moreover his attitude to kitty in the past—the attitude of a grownup person to a child arising from his friendship with her brother—seemed to him yet another obstacle to love an ugly goodnatured man as he considered himself might he supposed be liked as a friend but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved kitty one would need to be a handsome and still more a distinguished man he had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men but he did not believe it for he judged by himself and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful mysterious and exceptional women but after spending two months alone in the country he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth that this feeling gave him not an instant’s rest that he could not live without deciding the question would she or would she not be his wife and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected and he had now come to moscow with a firm determination to make an offer and get married if he were accepted or  he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected on arriving in moscow by a morning train levin had put up at the house of his elder halfbrother koznishev after changing his clothes he went down to his brother’s study intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother was not alone with him there was a wellknown professor of philosophy who had come from harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question the professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists sergey koznishev had been following this crusade with interest and after reading the professor’s last article he had written him a letter stating his objections he accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists and the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out the point in discussion was the question then in vogue is there a line to be drawn between psychological and physiological phenomena in man and if so where sergey ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone and introducing him to the professor went on with the conversation a little man in spectacles with a narrow forehead tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him levin sat down to wait till the professor should go but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing and had read them interested in them as a development of the first principles of science familiar to him as a natural science student at the university but he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those questions as to the meaning of life and death to himself which had of late been more and more often in his mind as he listened to his brother’s argument with the professor he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems that at times they almost touched on the latter but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions reservations quotations allusions and appeals to authorities and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about “i cannot admit it” said sergey ivanovitch with his habitual clearness precision of expression and elegance of phrase “i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions the most fundamental idea the idea of existence has not been received by me through sensation indeed there is no special senseorgan for the transmission of such an idea” “yes but they—wurt and knaust and pripasov—would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations wurt indeed says plainly that assuming there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence” “i maintain the contrary” began sergey ivanovitch but here it seemed to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor “according to that if my senses are annihilated if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort” he queried the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the interruption looked round at the strange inquirer more like a bargeman than a philosopher and turned his eyes upon sergey ivanovitch as though to ask what’s one to say to him but sergey ivanovitch who had been talking with far less heat and onesidedness than the professor and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said “that question we have no right to answer as yet” “we have not the requisite data” chimed in the professor and he went back to his argument “no” he said “i would point out the fact that if as pripasov directly asserts perception is based on sensation then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions” levin listened no more and simply waited for the professor to go when the professor had gone sergey ivanovitch turned to his brother “delighted that you’ve come for some time is it how’s your farming getting on” levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming and only put the question in deference to him and so he only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married and to ask his advice he had indeed firmly resolved to do so but after seeing his brother listening to his conversation with the professor hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters their mother’s property had not been divided and levin took charge of both their shares levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to him of his intention of marrying he felt that his brother would not look at it as he would have wished him to “well how is your district council doing” asked sergey ivanovitch who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great importance to them “i really don’t know” “what why surely you’re a member of the board” “no i’m not a member now i’ve resigned” answered levin “and i no longer attend the meetings” “what a pity” commented sergey ivanovitch frowning levin in selfdefense began to describe what took place in the meetings in his district “that’s how it always is” sergey ivanovitch interrupted him “we russians are always like that perhaps it’s our strong point really the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings but we overdo it we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues all i say is give such rights as our local selfgovernment to any other european people—why the germans or the english would have worked their way to freedom from them while we simply turn them into ridicule” “but how can it be helped” said levin penitently “it was my last effort and i did try with all my soul i can’t i’m no good at it” “it’s not that you’re no good at it” said sergey ivanovitch “it is that you don’t look at it as you should” “perhaps not” levin answered dejectedly “oh do you know brother nikolay’s turned up again” this brother nikolay was the elder brother of konstantin levin and halfbrother of sergey ivanovitch a man utterly ruined who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune was living in the strangest and lowest company and had quarreled with his brothers “what did you say” levin cried with horror “how do you know” “prokofy saw him in the street” “here in moscow where is he do you know” levin got up from his chair as though on the point of starting off at once “i am sorry i told you” said sergey ivanovitch shaking his head at his younger brother’s excitement “i sent to find out where he is living and sent him his iou to trubin which i paid this is the answer he sent me” and sergey ivanovitch took a note from under a paperweight and handed it to his brother levin read in the queer familiar handwriting “i humbly beg you to leave me in peace that’s the only favor i ask of my gracious brothers—nikolay levin” levin read it and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite sergey ivanovitch there was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time and the consciousness that it would be base to do so “he obviously wants to offend me” pursued sergey ivanovitch “but he cannot offend me and i should have wished with all my heart to assist him but i know it’s impossible to do that” “yes yes” repeated levin “i understand and appreciate your attitude to him but i shall go and see him” “if you want to do but i shouldn’t advise it” said sergey ivanovitch “as regards myself i have no fear of your doing so he will not make you quarrel with me but for your own sake i should say you would do better not to go you can’t do him any good still do as you please” “very likely i can’t do any good but i feel—especially at such a moment—but that’s another thing—i feel i could not be at peace” “well that i don’t understand” said sergey ivanovitch “one thing i do understand” he added “it’s a lesson in humility i have come to look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous since brother nikolay has become what he is  you know what he did” “oh it’s awful awful” repeated levin after obtaining his brother’s address from sergey ivanovitch’s footman levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening the first thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to moscow for from his brother’s levin went to oblonsky’s office and on getting news of the shtcherbatskys from him he drove to the place where he had been told he might find kitty at four o’clock conscious of his throbbing heart levin stepped out of a hired sledge at the zoological gardens and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground knowing that he would certainly find her there as he had seen the shtcherbatskys’ carriage at the entrance it was a bright frosty day rows of carriages sledges drivers and policemen were standing in the approach crowds of welldressed people with hats bright in the sun swarmed about the entrance and along the wellswept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the russian style the old curly birches of the gardens all their twigs laden with snow looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments he walked along the path towards the skatingground and kept saying to himself—“you mustn’t be excited you must be calm what’s the matter with you what do you want be quiet stupid” he conjured his heart and the more he tried to compose himself the more breathless he found himself an acquaintance met him and called him by his name but levin did not even recognize him he went towards the mounds whence came the clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up the rumble of the sliding sledges and the sounds of merry voices he walked on a few steps and the skatingground lay open before his eyes and at once amidst all the skaters he knew her he knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his heart she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles everything was made bright by her she was the smile that shed light on all round her “is it possible i can go over there on the ice go up to her” he thought the place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine unapproachable and there was one moment when he was almost retreating so overwhelmed was he with terror he had to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her and that he too might come there to skate he walked down for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun but seeing her as one does the sun without looking on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquainted with one another used to meet on the ice there were crack skaters there showing off their skill and learners clinging to chairs with timid awkward movements boys and elderly people skating with hygienic motives they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here near her all the skaters it seemed with perfect selfpossession skated towards her skated by her even spoke to her and were happy quite apart from her enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather nikolay shtcherbatsky kitty’s cousin in a short jacket and tight trousers was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on seeing levin he shouted to him “ah the first skater in russia been here long firstrate ice—do put your skates on” “i haven’t got my skates” levin answered marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second losing sight of her though he did not look at her he felt as though the sun were coming near him she was in a corner and turning out her slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity she skated towards him a boy in russian dress desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground overtook her she skated a little uncertainly taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord she held them ready for emergency and looking towards levin whom she had recognized she smiled at him and at her own fears when she had got round the turn she gave herself a push off with one foot and skated straight up to shtcherbatsky clutching at his arm she nodded smiling to levin she was more splendid than he had imagined her when he thought of her he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders and so full of childish brightness and good humor the childishness of her expression together with the delicate beauty of her figure made up her special charm and that he fully realized but what always struck him in her as something unlooked for was the expression of her eyes soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transported levin to an enchanted world where he felt himself softened and tender as he remembered himself in some days of his early childhood “have you been here long” she said giving him her hand “thank you” she added as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff “i i’ve not long  yesterday  i mean today  i arrived” answered levin in his emotion not at once understanding her question “i was meaning to come and see you” he said and then recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed “i didn’t know you could skate and skate so well” she looked at him earnestly as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion “your praise is worth having the tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters” she said with her little blackgloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff “yes i used once to skate with passion i wanted to reach perfection” “you do everything with passion i think” she said smiling “i should so like to see how you skate put on skates and let us skate together” “skate together can that be possible” thought levin gazing at her “i’ll put them on directly” he said and he went off to get skates “it’s a long while since we’ve seen you here sir” said the attendant supporting his foot and screwing on the heel of the skate “except you there’s none of the gentlemen firstrate skaters will that be all right” said he tightening the strap “oh yes yes make haste please” answered levin with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face “yes” he thought “this now is life this is happiness together she said let us skate together speak to her now but that’s just why i’m afraid to speak—because i’m happy now happy in hope anyway and then but i must i must i must away with weakness” levin rose to his feet took off his overcoat and scurrying over the rough ice round the hut came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort as it were by simple exercise of will increasing and slackening speed and turning his course he approached with timidity but again her smile reassured him she gave him her hand and they set off side by side going faster and faster and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand “with you i should soon learn i somehow feel confidence in you” she said to him “and i have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me” he said but was at once panicstricken at what he had said and blushed and indeed no sooner had he uttered these words when all at once like the sun going behind a cloud her face lost all its friendliness and levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the working of thought a crease showed on her smooth brow “is there anything troubling you—though i’ve no right to ask such a question” he added hurriedly “oh why so no i have nothing to trouble me” she responded coldly and she added immediately “you haven’t seen mlle linon have you” “not yet” “go and speak to her she likes you so much” “what’s wrong i have offended her lord help me” thought levin and he flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets who was sitting on a bench smiling and showing her false teeth she greeted him as an old friend “yes you see we’re growing up” she said to him glancing towards kitty “and growing old tiny bear has grown big now” pursued the frenchwoman laughing and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english nursery tale “do you remember that’s what you used to call them” he remembered absolutely nothing but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now and was fond of it “now go and skate go and skate our kitty has learned to skate nicely hasn’t she” when levin darted up to kitty her face was no longer stern her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness but levin fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate composure and he felt depressed after talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities she questioned him about his life “surely you must be dull in the country in the winter aren’t you” she said “no i’m not dull i am very busy” he said feeling that she was holding him in check by her composed tone which he would not have the force to break through just as it had been at the beginning of the winter “are you going to stay in town long” kitty questioned him “i don’t know” he answered not thinking of what he was saying the thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his mind and he resolved to make a struggle against it “how is it you don’t know” “i don’t know it depends upon you” he said and was immediately horrorstricken at his own words whether it was that she had heard his words or that she did not want to hear them she made a sort of stumble twice struck out and hurriedly skated away from him she skated up to mlle linon said something to her and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates “my god what have i done merciful god help me guide me” said levin praying inwardly and at the same time feeling a need of violent exercise he skated about describing inner and outer circles at that moment one of the young men the best of the skaters of the day came out of the coffeehouse in his skates with a cigarette in his mouth taking a run he dashed down the steps in his skates crashing and bounding up and down he flew down and without even changing the position of his hands skated away over the ice “ah that’s a new trick” said levin and he promptly ran up to the top to do this new trick “don’t break your neck it needs practice” nikolay shtcherbatsky shouted after him levin went to the steps took a run from above as best he could and dashed down preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands on the last step he stumbled but barely touching the ice with his hand with a violent effort recovered himself and skated off laughing “how splendid how nice he is” kitty was thinking at that time as she came out of the pavilion with mlle linon and looked towards him with a smile of quiet affection as though he were a favorite brother “and can it be my fault can i have done anything wrong they talk of flirtation i know it’s not he that i love but still i am happy with him and he’s so jolly only why did he say that” she mused catching sight of kitty going away and her mother meeting her at the steps levin flushed from his rapid exercise stood still and pondered a minute he took off his skates and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens “delighted to see you” said princess shtcherbatskaya “on thursdays we are home as always” “today then” “we shall be pleased to see you” the princess said stiffly this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mother’s coldness she turned her head and with a smile said “goodbye till this evening” at that moment stepan arkadyevitch his hat cocked on one side with beaming face and eyes strode into the garden like a conquering hero but as he approached his motherinlaw he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries about dolly’s health after a little subdued and dejected conversation with his motherinlaw he threw out his chest again and put his arm in levin’s “well shall we set off” he asked “i’ve been thinking about you all this time and i’m very very glad you’ve come” he said looking him in the face with a significant air “yes come along” answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying “goodbye till this evening” and seeing the smile with which it was said “to the england or the hermitage” “i don’t mind which” “all right then the england” said stepan arkadyevitch selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it “have you got a sledge that’s firstrate for i sent my carriage home” the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in kitty’s expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words “goodbye till this evening” stepan arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner “you like turbot don’t you” he said to levin as they were arriving “eh” responded levin “turbot yes i’m awfully fond of turbot” when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression as it were a restrained radiance about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevitch oblonsky took off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walked into the diningroom giving directions to the tatar waiters who were clustered about him in evening coats bearing napkins bowing to right and left to the people he met and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons lace and ringlets behind the counter something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that frenchwoman all made up it seemed of false hair poudre de riz and vinaigre de toilette he made haste to move away from her as from a dirty place his whole soul was filled with memories of kitty and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes “this way your excellency please your excellency won’t be disturbed here” said a particularly pertinacious whiteheaded old tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind “walk in your excellency” he said to levin by way of showing his respect to stepan arkadyevitch being attentive to his guest as well instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier though it already had a table cloth on it he pushed up velvet chairs and came to a standstill before stepan arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands awaiting his commands “if you prefer it your excellency a private room will be free directly prince golistin with a lady fresh oysters have come in” “ah oysters” stepan arkadyevitch became thoughtful “how if we were to change our program levin” he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressed serious hesitation “are the oysters good mind now” “they’re flensburg your excellency we’ve no ostend” “flensburg will do but are they fresh” “only arrived yesterday” “well then how if we were to begin with oysters and so change the whole program eh” “it’s all the same to me i should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything but of course there’s nothing like that here” “porridge à la russe your honor would like” said the tatar bending down to levin like a nurse speaking to a child “no joking apart whatever you choose is sure to be good i’ve been skating and i’m hungry and don’t imagine” he added detecting a look of dissatisfaction on oblonsky’s face “that i shan’t appreciate your choice i am fond of good things” “i should hope so after all it’s one of the pleasures of life” said stepan arkadyevitch “well then my friend you give us two—or better say three—dozen oysters clear soup with vegetables” “printanière” prompted the tatar but stepan arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the french names of the dishes “with vegetables in it you know then turbot with thick sauce then  roast beef and mind it’s good yes and capons perhaps and then sweets” the tatar recollecting that it was stepan arkadyevitch’s way not to call the dishes by the names in the french bill of fare did not repeat them after him but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill—“soupe printanière turbot sauce beaumarchais poulard à l’estragon macédoine de fruits  etc” and then instantly as though worked by springs laying down one bound bill of fare he took up another the list of wines and submitted it to stepan arkadyevitch “what shall we drink” “what you like only not too much champagne” said levin “what to start with you’re right though i dare say do you like the white seal” “cachet blanc” prompted the tatar “very well then give us that brand with the oysters and then we’ll see” “yes sir and what table wine” “you can give us nuits oh no better the classic chablis” “yes sir and your cheese your excellency” “oh yes parmesan or would you like another” “no it’s all the same to me” said levin unable to suppress a smile and the tatar ran off with flying coattails and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters on motherofpearl shells and a bottle between his fingers stepan arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin tucked it into his waistcoat and settling his arms comfortably started on the oysters “not bad” he said stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a silver fork and swallowing them one after another “not bad” he repeated turning his dewy brilliant eyes from levin to the tatar levin ate the oysters indeed though white bread and cheese would have pleased him better but he was admiring oblonsky even the tatar uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses glanced at stepan arkadyevitch and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction “you don’t care much for oysters do you” said stepan arkadyevitch emptying his wineglass “or you’re worried about something eh” he wanted levin to be in good spirits but it was not that levin was not in good spirits he was ill at ease with what he had in his soul he felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies in all this fuss and bustle the surroundings of bronzes lookingglasses gas and waiters—all of it was offensive to him he was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of “i yes i am but besides all this bothers me” he said “you can’t conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me as queer as that gentleman’s nails i saw at your place” “yes i saw how much interested you were in poor grinevitch’s nails” said stepan arkadyevitch laughing “it’s too much for me” responded levin “do try now and put yourself in my place take the point of view of a country person we in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with so we cut our nails sometimes we turn up our sleeves and here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will and link on small saucers by way of studs so that they can do nothing with their hands” stepan arkadyevitch smiled gaily “oh yes that’s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work his work is with the mind” “maybe but still it’s queer to me just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can so as to be ready for our work while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible and with that object eating oysters” “why of course” objected stepan arkadyevitch “but that’s just the aim of civilization—to make everything a source of enjoyment” “well if that’s its aim i’d rather be a savage” “and so you are a savage all you levins are savages” levin sighed he remembered his brother nikolay and felt ashamed and sore and he scowled but oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention “oh i say are you going tonight to our people the shtcherbatskys’ i mean” he said his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells and drew the cheese towards him “yes i shall certainly go” replied levin “though i fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation” “what nonsense that’s her manner come boy the soup that’s her manner—grande dame” said stepan arkadyevitch “i’m coming too but i have to go to the countess bonina’s rehearsal come isn’t it true that you’re a savage how do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from moscow the shtcherbatskys were continually asking me about you as though i ought to know the only thing i know is that you always do what no one else does” “yes” said levin slowly and with emotion “you’re right i am a savage only my savageness is not in having gone away but in coming now now i have come” “oh what a lucky fellow you are” broke in stepan arkadyevitch looking into levin’s eyes “why” “‘i know a gallant steed by tokens sure and by his eyes i know a youth in love’” declaimed stepan arkadyevitch “everything is before you” “why is it over for you already” “no not over exactly but the future is yours and the present is mine and the present—well it’s not all that it might be” “how so” “oh things go wrong but i don’t want to talk of myself and besides i can’t explain it all” said stepan arkadyevitch “well why have you come to moscow then hi take away” he called to the tatar “you guess” responded levin his eyes like deep wells of light fixed on stepan arkadyevitch “i guess but i can’t be the first to talk about it you can see by that whether i guess right or wrong” said stepan arkadyevitch gazing at levin with a subtle smile “well and what have you to say to me” said levin in a quivering voice feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too “how do you look at the question” stepan arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of chablis never taking his eyes off levin “i” said stepan arkadyevitch “there’s nothing i desire so much as that—nothing it would be the best thing that could be” “but you’re not making a mistake you know what we’re speaking of” said levin piercing him with his eyes “you think it’s possible” “i think it’s possible why not possible” “no do you really think it’s possible no tell me all you think oh but if  if refusal’s in store for me indeed i feel sure” “why should you think that” said stepan arkadyevitch smiling at his excitement “it seems so to me sometimes that will be awful for me and for her too” “oh well anyway there’s nothing awful in it for a girl every girl’s proud of an offer” “yes every girl but not she” stepan arkadyevitch smiled he so well knew that feeling of levin’s that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes one class—all the girls in the world except her and those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses and very ordinary girls the other class—she alone having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity “stay take some sauce” he said holding back levin’s hand as it pushed away the sauce levin obediently helped himself to sauce but would not let stepan arkadyevitch go on with his dinner “no stop a minute stop a minute” he said “you must understand that it’s a question of life and death for me i have never spoken to anyone of this and there’s no one i could speak of it to except you you know we’re utterly unlike each other different tastes and views and everything but i know you’re fond of me and understand me and that’s why i like you awfully but for god’s sake be quite straightforward with me” “i tell you what i think” said stepan arkadyevitch smiling “but i’ll say more my wife is a wonderful woman” stepan arkadyevitch sighed remembering his position with his wife and after a moment’s silence resumed—“she has a gift of foreseeing things she sees right through people but that’s not all she knows what will come to pass especially in the way of marriages she foretold for instance that princess shahovskaya would marry brenteln no one would believe it but it came to pass and she’s on your side” “how do you mean” “it’s not only that she likes you—she says that kitty is certain to be your wife” at these words levin’s face suddenly lighted up with a smile a smile not far from tears of emotion “she says that” cried levin “i always said she was exquisite your wife there that’s enough enough said about it” he said getting up from his seat “all right but do sit down” but levin could not sit down he walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall and only then sat down to the table “you must understand” said he “it’s not love i’ve been in love but it’s not that it’s not my feeling but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me i went away you see because i made up my mind that it could never be you understand as a happiness that does not come on earth but i’ve struggled with myself i see there’s no living without it and it must be settled” “what did you go away for” “ah stop a minute ah the thoughts that come crowding on one the questions one must ask oneself listen you can’t imagine what you’ve done for me by what you said i’m so happy that i’ve become positively hateful i’ve forgotten everything i heard today that my brother nikolay  you know he’s here  i had even forgotten him it seems to me that he’s happy too it’s a sort of madness but one thing’s awful here you’ve been married you know the feeling  it’s awful that we—old—with a past  not of love but of sins  are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent it’s loathsome and that’s why one can’t help feeling oneself unworthy” “oh well you’ve not many sins on your conscience” “alas all the same” said levin “when with loathing i go over my life i shudder and curse and bitterly regret it yes” “what would you have the world’s made so” said stepan arkadyevitch “the one comfort is like that prayer which i always liked ‘forgive me not according to my unworthiness but according to thy lovingkindness’ that’s the only way she can forgive me” levin emptied his glass and they were silent for a while “there’s one other thing i ought to tell you do you know vronsky” stepan arkadyevitch asked levin “no i don’t why do you ask” “give us another bottle” stepan arkadyevitch directed the tatar who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not wanted “why you ought to know vronsky is that he’s one of your rivals” “who’s vronsky” said levin and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression “vronsky is one of the sons of count kirill ivanovitch vronsky and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of petersburg i made his acquaintance in tver when i was there on official business and he came there for the levy of recruits fearfully rich handsome great connections an aidedecamp and with all that a very nice goodnatured fellow but he’s more than simply a goodnatured fellow as i’ve found out here—he’s a cultivated man too and very intelligent he’s a man who’ll make his mark” levin scowled and was dumb “well he turned up here soon after you’d gone and as i can see he’s over head and ears in love with kitty and you know that her mother” “excuse me but i know nothing” said levin frowning gloomily and immediately he recollected his brother nikolay and how hateful he was to have been able to forget him “you wait a bit wait a bit” said stepan arkadyevitch smiling and touching his hand “i’ve told you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chances are in your favor” levin dropped back in his chair his face was pale “but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be” pursued oblonsky filling up his glass “no thanks i can’t drink any more” said levin pushing away his glass “i shall be drunk come tell me how are you getting on” he went on obviously anxious to change the conversation “one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i don’t advise you to speak” said stepan arkadyevitch “go round tomorrow morning make an offer in due form and god bless you” “oh do you still think of coming to me for some shooting come next spring do” said levin now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevitch a feeling such as his was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some petersburg officer of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevitch stepan arkadyevitch smiled he knew what was passing in levin’s soul “i’ll come some day” he said “but women my boy they’re the pivot everything turns upon things are in a bad way with me very bad and it’s all through women tell me frankly now” he pursued picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass “give me your advice” “why what is it” “i’ll tell you suppose you’re married you love your wife but you’re fascinated by another woman” “excuse me but i’m absolutely unable to comprehend how  just as i can’t comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a baker’s shop and steal a roll” stepan arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled more than usual “why not a roll will sometimes smell so good one can’t resist it” “himmlisch ist’s wenn ich bezwungen meine irdische begier aber doch wenn’s nich gelungen hatt’ ich auch recht hübsch plaisir” as he said this stepan arkadyevitch smiled subtly levin too could not help smiling “yes but joking apart” resumed stepan arkadyevitch “you must understand that the woman is a sweet gentle loving creature poor and lonely and has sacrificed everything now when the thing’s done don’t you see can one possibly cast her off even supposing one parts from her so as not to break up one’s family life still can one help feeling for her setting her on her feet softening her lot” “well you must excuse me there you know to me all women are divided into two classes  at least no  truer to say there are women and there are  i’ve never seen exquisite fallen beings and i never shall see them but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind and all fallen women are the same” “but the magdalen” “ah drop that christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered however i’m not saying so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fallen women you’re afraid of spiders and i of these vermin most likely you’ve not made a study of spiders and don’t know their character and so it is with me” “it’s very well for you to talk like that it’s very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder but to deny the facts is no answer what’s to be done—you tell me that what’s to be done your wife gets older while you’re full of life before you’ve time to look round you feel that you can’t love your wife with love however much you may esteem her and then all at once love turns up and you’re done for done for” stepan arkadyevitch said with weary despair levin half smiled “yes you’re done for” resumed oblonsky “but what’s to be done” “don’t steal rolls” stepan arkadyevitch laughed outright “oh moralist but you must understand there are two women one insists only on her rights and those rights are your love which you can’t give her and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing what are you to do how are you to act there’s a fearful tragedy in it” “if you care for my profession of faith as regards that i’ll tell you that i don’t believe there was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love  both the sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet served as the test of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love have no need to talk of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy ‘i’m much obliged for the gratification my humble respects’—that’s all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because” at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly “but perhaps you are right very likely  i don’t know i don’t know” “it’s this don’t you see” said stepan arkadyevitch “you’re very much all of a piece that’s your strong point and your failing you have a character that’s all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too—but that’s not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim—and that’s not how it is you want a man’s work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided—and that’s not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow” levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and did not hear oblonsky and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining and drinking together which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases “bill” he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an aidedecamp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in the conversation with the aidedecamp oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain when the tatar appeared with a bill for twentysix roubles and odd kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homewards to dress and go to the shtcherbatskys’ there to decide his fate the young princess kitty shtcherbatskaya was eighteen it was the first winter that she had been out in the world her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters and greater even than her mother had anticipated to say nothing of the young men who danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty two serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky levin’s appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visits and evident love for kitty had led to the first serious conversations between kitty’s parents as to her future and to disputes between them the prince was on levin’s side he said he wished for nothing better for kitty the princess for her part going round the question in the manner peculiar to women maintained that kitty was too young that levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions that kitty felt no great attraction to him and other side issues but she did not state the principal point which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter and that levin was not to her liking and she did not understand him when levin had abruptly departed the princess was delighted and said to her husband triumphantly “you see i was right” when vronsky appeared on the scene she was still more delighted confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good but a brilliant match in the mother’s eyes there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin she disliked in levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society founded as she supposed on his pride and his queer sort of life as she considered it absorbed in cattle and peasants she did not very much like it that he who was in love with her daughter had kept coming to the house for six weeks as though he were waiting for something inspecting as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer and did not realize that a man who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl is bound to make his intentions clear and suddenly without doing so he disappeared “it’s as well he’s not attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him” thought the mother vronsky satisfied all the mother’s desires very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing better could be wished for vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls danced with her and came continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions but in spite of that the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation princess shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago her aunt arranging the match her husband about whom everything was well known beforehand had come looked at his future bride and been looked at the matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression that impression had been favorable afterwards on a day fixed beforehand the expected offer was made to her parents and accepted all had passed very simply and easily so it seemed at least to the princess but over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business apparently so commonplace of marrying off one’s daughters the panics that had been lived through the thoughts that had been brooded over the money that had been wasted and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls darya and natalia now since the youngest had come out she was going through the same terrors the same doubts and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls the old prince like all fathers indeed was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters he was irrationally jealous over his daughters especially over kitty who was his favorite at every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter the princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters but now she felt that there was more ground for the prince’s touchiness she saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society that a mother’s duties had become still more difficult she saw that girls of kitty’s age formed some sort of clubs went to some sort of lectures mixed freely in men’s society drove about the streets alone many of them did not curtsey and what was the most important thing all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair and not their parents’ “marriages aren’t made nowadays as they used to be” was thought and said by all these young girls and even by their elders but how marriages were made now the princess could not learn from anyone the french fashion—of the parents arranging their children’s future—was not accepted it was condemned the english fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted and not possible in russian society the russian fashion of matchmaking by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered unseemly it was ridiculed by everyone and by the princess herself but how girls were to be married and how parents were to marry them no one knew everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing “mercy on us it’s high time in our day to cast off all that oldfashioned business it’s the young people have to marry and not their parents and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose” it was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband and however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves she was unable to believe it just as she would have been unable to believe that at any time whatever the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols and so the princess was more uneasy over kitty than she had been over her elder sisters now she was afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter she saw that her daughter was in love with him but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man and would not do this but at the same time she knew how easy it is with the freedom of manners of today to turn a girl’s head and how lightly men generally regard such a crime the week before kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with vronsky during a mazurka this conversation had partly reassured the princess but perfectly at ease she could not be vronsky had told kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her “and just now i am impatiently awaiting my mother’s arrival from petersburg as peculiarly fortunate” he told her kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words but her mother saw them in a different light she knew that the old lady was expected from day to day that she would be pleased at her son’s choice and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vexing his mother however she was so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fears that she believed it was so bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter dolly on the point of leaving her husband her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter’s fate engrossed all her feelings today with levin’s reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arose she was afraid that her daughter who had at one time as she fancied a feeling for levin might from extreme sense of honor refuse vronsky and that levin’s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded “why has he been here long” the princess asked about levin as they returned home “he came today mamma” “there’s one thing i want to say” began the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guessed what it would be “mamma” she said flushing hotly and turning quickly to her “please please don’t say anything about that i know i know all about it” she wished for what her mother wished for but the motives of her mother’s wishes wounded her “i only want to say that to raise hopes” “mamma darling for goodness’ sake don’t talk about it it’s so horrible to talk about it” “i won’t” said her mother seeing the tears in her daughter’s eyes “but one thing my love you promised me you would have no secrets from me you won’t” “never mamma none” answered kitty flushing a little and looking her mother straight in the face “but there’s no use in my telling you anything and i  i  if i wanted to i don’t know what to say or how i don’t know” “no she could not tell an untruth with those eyes” thought the mother smiling at her agitation and happiness the princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important after dinner and till the beginning of the evening kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle her heart throbbed violently and her thoughts would not rest on anything she felt that this evening when they would both meet for the first time would be a turning point in her life and she was continually picturing them to herself at one moment each separately and then both together when she mused on the past she dwelt with pleasure with tenderness on the memories of her relations with levin the memories of childhood and of levin’s friendship with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him his love for her of which she felt certain was flattering and delightful to her and it was pleasant for her to think of levin in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness though he was in the highest degree wellbred and at ease as though there were some false note—not in vronsky he was very simple and nice but in herself while with levin she felt perfectly simple and clear but on the other hand directly she thought of the future with vronsky there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness with levin the future seemed misty when she went upstairs to dress and looked into the lookingglass she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days and that she was in complete possession of all her forces—she needed this so for what lay before her she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements at halfpast seven she had only just gone down into the drawingroom when the footman announced “konstantin dmitrievitch levin” the princess was still in her room and the prince had not come in “so it is to be” thought kitty and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart she was horrified at her paleness as she glanced into the lookingglass at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer and only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new different aspect only then she realized that the question did not affect her only—with whom she would be happy and whom she loved—but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked and to wound him cruelly what for because he dear fellow loved her was in love with her but there was no help for it so it must be so it would have to be “my god shall i myself really have to say it to him” she thought “can i tell him i don’t love him that will be a lie what am i to say to him that i love someone else no that’s impossible i’m going away i’m going away” she had reached the door when she heard his step “no it’s not honest what have i to be afraid of i have done nothing wrong what is to be will be i’ll tell the truth and with him one can’t be ill at ease here he is” she said to herself seeing his powerful shy figure with his shining eyes fixed on her she looked straight into his face as though imploring him to spare her and gave her hand “it’s not time yet i think i’m too early” he said glancing round the empty drawingroom when he saw that his expectations were realized that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking his face became gloomy “oh no” said kitty and sat down at the table “but this was just what i wanted to find you alone” he began not sitting down and not looking at her so as not to lose courage “mamma will be down directly she was very much tired yesterday” she talked on not knowing what her lips were uttering and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him he glanced at her she blushed and ceased speaking “i told you i did not know whether i should be here long  that it depended on you” she dropped her head lower and lower not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming “that it depended on you” he repeated “i meant to say  i meant to say  i came for this  to be my wife” he brought out not knowing what he was saying but feeling that the most terrible thing was said he stopped short and looked at her she was breathing heavily not looking at him she was feeling ecstasy her soul was flooded with happiness she had never anticipated that the utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her but it lasted only an instant she remembered vronsky she lifted her clear truthful eyes and seeing his desperate face she answered hastily “that cannot be  forgive me” a moment ago and how close she had been to him of what importance in his life and how aloof and remote from him she had become now “it was bound to be so” he said not looking at her he bowed and was meaning to retreat but at that very moment the princess came in there was a look of horror on her face when she saw them alone and their disturbed faces levin bowed to her and said nothing kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes “thank god she has refused him” thought the mother and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country he sat down again waiting for other visitors to arrive in order to retreat unnoticed five minutes later there came in a friend of kitty’s married the preceding winter countess nordston she was a thin sallow sickly and nervous woman with brilliant black eyes she was fond of kitty and her affection for her showed itself as the affection of married women for girls always does in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness she wanted her to marry vronsky levin she had often met at the shtcherbatskys’ early in the winter and she had always disliked him her invariable and favorite pursuit when they met consisted in making fun of him “i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur or breaks off his learned conversation with me because i’m a fool or is condescending to me i like that so to see him condescending i am so glad he can’t bear me” she used to say of him she was right for levin actually could not bear her and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic—her nervousness her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly the countess nordston and levin got into that relation with one another not seldom seen in society when two persons who remain externally on friendly terms despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously and cannot even be offended by each other the countess nordston pounced upon levin at once “ah konstantin dmitrievitch so you’ve come back to our corrupt babylon” she said giving him her tiny yellow hand and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter that moscow was a babylon “come is babylon reformed or have you degenerated” she added glancing with a simper at kitty “it’s very flattering for me countess that you remember my words so well” responded levin who had succeeded in recovering his composure and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordston “they must certainly make a great impression on you” “oh i should think so i always note them all down well kitty have you been skating again” and she began talking to kitty awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes he was on the point of getting up when the princess noticing that he was silent addressed him “shall you be long in moscow you’re busy with the district council though aren’t you and can’t be away for long” “no princess i’m no longer a member of the council” he said “i have come up for a few days” “there’s something the matter with him” thought countess nordston glancing at his stern serious face “he isn’t in his old argumentative mood but i’ll draw him out i do love making a fool of him before kitty and i’ll do it” “konstantin dmitrievitch” she said to him “do explain to me please what’s the meaning of it you know all about such things at home in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed and now they can’t pay us any rent what’s the meaning of that you always praise the peasants so” at that instant another lady came into the room and levin got up “excuse me countess but i really know nothing about it and can’t tell you anything” he said and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady “that must be vronsky” thought levin and to be sure of it glanced at kitty she had already had time to look at vronsky and looked round at levin and simply from the look in her eyes that grew unconsciously brighter levin knew that she loved that man knew it as surely as if she had told him so in words but what sort of a man was he now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man was like whom she loved there are people who on meeting a successful rival no matter in what are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him and to see only what is bad there are people on the other hand who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has outstripped them and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good levin belonged to the second class but he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in vronsky it was apparent at the first glance vronsky was a squarely built dark man not very tall with a goodhumored handsome and exceedingly calm and resolute face everything about his face and figure from his shortcropped black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting brandnew uniform was simple and at the same time elegant making way for the lady who had come in vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty as he approached her his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seemed to levin bowing carefully and respectfully over her he held out his small broad hand to her greeting and saying a few words to everyone he sat down without once glancing at levin who had never taken his eyes off him “let me introduce you” said the princess indicating levin “konstantin dmitrievitch levin count alexey kirillovitch vronsky” vronsky got up and looking cordially at levin shook hands with him “i believe i was to have dined with you this winter” he said smiling his simple and open smile “but you had unexpectedly left for the country” “konstantin dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople” said countess nordston “my words must make a deep impression on you since you remember them so well” said levin and suddenly conscious that he had said just the same thing before he reddened vronsky looked at levin and countess nordston and smiled “are you always in the country” he inquired “i should think it must be dull in the winter” “it’s not dull if one has work to do besides one’s not dull by oneself” levin replied abruptly “i am fond of the country” said vronsky noticing and affecting not to notice levin’s tone “but i hope count you would not consent to live in the country always” said countess nordston “i don’t know i have never tried for long i experienced a queer feeling once” he went on “i never longed so for the country russian country with bast shoes and peasants as when i was spending a winter with my mother in nice nice itself is dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time and it’s just there that russia comes back to me most vividly and especially the country it’s as though” he talked on addressing both kitty and levin turning his serene friendly eyes from one to the other and saying obviously just what came into his head noticing that countess nordston wanted to say something he stopped short without finishing what he had begun and listened attentively to her the conversation did not flag for an instant so that the princess who always kept in reserve in case a subject should be lacking two heavy guns—the relative advantages of classical and of modern education and universal military service—had not to move out either of them while countess nordston had not a chance of chaffing levin levin wanted to and could not take part in the general conversation saying to himself every instant “now go” he still did not go as though waiting for something the conversation fell upon tableturning and spirits and countess nordston who believed in spiritualism began to describe the marvels she had seen “ah countess you really must take me for pity’s sake do take me to see them i have never seen anything extraordinary though i am always on the lookout for it everywhere” said vronsky smiling “very well next saturday” answered countess nordston “but you konstantin dmitrievitch do you believe in it” she asked levin “why do you ask me you know what i shall say” “but i want to hear your opinion” “my opinion” answered levin “is only that this tableturning simply proves that educated society—so called—is no higher than the peasants they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and omens while we” “oh then you don’t believe in it” “i can’t believe in it countess” “but if i’ve seen it myself” “the peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins” “then you think i tell a lie” and she laughed a mirthless laugh “oh no masha konstantin dmitrievitch said he could not believe in it” said kitty blushing for levin and levin saw this and still more exasperated would have answered but vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation which was threatening to become disagreeable “you do not admit the conceivability at all” he queried “but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to us which” “when electricity was discovered” levin interrupted hurriedly “it was only the phenomenon that was discovered and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects and ages passed before its applications were conceived but the spiritualists have begun with tables writing for them and spirits appearing to them and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force” vronsky listened attentively to levin as he always did listen obviously interested in his words “yes but the spiritualists say we don’t know at present what this force is but there is a force and these are the conditions in which it acts let the scientific men find out what the force consists in no i don’t see why there should not be a new force if it” “why because with electricity” levin interrupted again “every time you rub tar against wool a recognized phenomenon is manifested but in this case it does not happen every time and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon” feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawingroom vronsky made no rejoinder but by way of trying to change the conversation he smiled brightly and turned to the ladies “do let us try at once countess” he said but levin would finish saying what he thought “i think” he went on “that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment” everyone was waiting for him to finish and he felt it “and i think you would be a firstrate medium” said countess nordston “there’s something enthusiastic in you” levin opened his mouth was about to say something reddened and said nothing “do let us try tableturning at once please” said vronsky “princess will you allow it” and vronsky stood up looking for a little table kitty got up to fetch a table and as she passed her eyes met levin’s she felt for him with her whole heart the more because she was pitying him for suffering of which she was herself the cause “if you can forgive me forgive me” said her eyes “i am so happy” “i hate them all and you and myself” his eyes responded and he took up his hat but he was not destined to escape just as they were arranging themselves round the table and levin was on the point of retiring the old prince came in and after greeting the ladies addressed levin “ah” he began joyously “been here long my boy i didn’t even know you were in town very glad to see you” the old prince embraced levin and talking to him did not observe vronsky who had risen and was serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him kitty felt how distasteful her father’s warmth was to levin after what had happened she saw too how coldly her father responded at last to vronsky’s bow and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed towards him and she flushed “prince let us have konstantin dmitrievitch” said countess nordston “we want to try an experiment” “what experiment tableturning well you must excuse me ladies and gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game” said the old prince looking at vronsky and guessing that it had been his suggestion “there’s some sense in that anyway” vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes and with a faint smile began immediately talking to countess nordston of the great ball that was to come off next week “i hope you will be there” he said to kitty as soon as the old prince turned away from him levin went out unnoticed and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling happy face of kitty answering vronsky’s inquiry about the ball at the end of the evening kitty told her mother of her conversation with levin and in spite of all the pity she felt for levin she was glad at the thought that she had received an offer she had no doubt that she had acted rightly but after she had gone to bed for a long while she could not sleep one impression pursued her relentlessly it was levin’s face with his scowling brows and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them as he stood listening to her father and glancing at her and at vronsky and she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes but immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up she vividly recalled his manly resolute face his noble selfpossession and the good nature conspicuous in everything towards everyone she remembered the love for her of the man she loved and once more all was gladness in her soul and she lay on the pillow smiling with happiness “i’m sorry i’m sorry but what could i do it’s not my fault” she said to herself but an inner voice told her something else whether she felt remorse at having won levin’s love or at having refused him she did not know but her happiness was poisoned by doubts “lord have pity on us lord have pity on us lord have pity on us” she repeated to herself till she fell asleep meanwhile there took place below in the prince’s little library one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter “what i’ll tell you what” shouted the prince waving his arms and at once wrapping his squirrellined dressinggown round him again “that you’ve no pride no dignity that you’re disgracing ruining your daughter by this vulgar stupid matchmaking” “but really for mercy’s sake prince what have i done” said the princess almost crying she pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter had gone to the prince to say goodnight as usual and though she had no intention of telling him of levin’s offer and kitty’s refusal still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with vronsky and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived and thereupon at those words the prince had all at once flown into a passion and began to use unseemly language “what have you done i’ll tell you what first of all you’re trying to catch an eligible gentleman and all moscow will be talking of it and with good reason if you have evening parties invite everyone don’t pick out the possible suitors invite all the young bucks engage a piano player and let them dance and not as you do things nowadays hunting up good matches it makes me sick sick to see it and you’ve gone on till you’ve turned the poor wench’s head levin’s a thousand times the better man as for this little petersburg swell they’re turned out by machinery all on one pattern and all precious rubbish but if he were a prince of the blood my daughter need not run after anyone” “but what have i done” “why you’ve” the prince was crying wrathfully “i know if one were to listen to you” interrupted the princess “we should never marry our daughter if it’s to be so we’d better go into the country” “well and we had better” “but do wait a minute do i try and catch them i don’t try to catch them in the least a young man and a very nice one has fallen in love with her and she i fancy” “oh yes you fancy and how if she really is in love and he’s no more thinking of marriage than i am oh that i should live to see it ah spiritualism ah nice ah the ball” and the prince imagining that he was mimicking his wife made a mincing curtsey at each word “and this is how we’re preparing wretchedness for kitty and she’s really got the notion into her head” “but what makes you suppose so” “i don’t suppose i know we have eyes for such things though womenfolk haven’t i see a man who has serious intentions that’s levin and i see a peacock like this featherhead who’s only amusing himself” “oh well when once you get an idea into your head” “well you’ll remember my words but too late just as with dolly” “well well we won’t talk of it” the princess stopped him recollecting her unlucky dolly “by all means and goodnight” and signing each other with the cross the husband and wife parted with a kiss feeling that they each remained of their own opinion the princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled kitty’s future and that there could be no doubt of vronsky’s intentions but her husband’s words had disturbed her and returning to her own room in terror before the unknown future she too like kitty repeated several times in her heart “lord have pity lord have pity lord have pity” vronsky had never had a real home life his mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman who had had during her married life and still more afterwards many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world his father he scarcely remembered and he had been educated in the corps of pages leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer he had at once got into the circle of wealthy petersburg army men although he did go more or less into petersburg society his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it in moscow he had for the first time felt after his luxurious and coarse life at petersburg all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank who cared for him it never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with kitty at balls he danced principally with her he was a constant visitor at their house he talked to her as people commonly do talk in society—all sorts of nonsense but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him and the more he felt this the better he liked it and the tenderer was his feeling for her he did not know that his mode of behavior in relation to kitty had a definite character that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was it seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure and he was enjoying his discovery if he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her he would have been greatly astonished and would not have believed it he could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him and above all to her could be wrong still less could he have believed that he ought to marry marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility he not only disliked family life but a family and especially a husband was in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived conceived as something alien repellant and above all ridiculous but though vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were saying he felt on coming away from the shtcherbatskys’ that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him and kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken but what step could and ought to be taken he could not imagine “what is so exquisite” he thought as he returned from the shtcherbatskys’ carrying away with him as he always did a delicious feeling of purity and freshness arising partly from the fact that he had not been smoking for a whole evening and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him—“what is so exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and tones that this evening more clearly than ever she told me she loves me and how secretly simply and most of all how trustfully i feel myself better purer i feel that i have a heart and that there is a great deal of good in me those sweet loving eyes when she said ‘indeed i do’ “well what then oh nothing it’s good for me and good for her” and he began wondering where to finish the evening he passed in review of the places he might go to “club a game of bezique champagne with ignatov no i’m not going château des fleurs there i shall find oblonsky songs the cancan no i’m sick of it that’s why i like the shtcherbatskys’ that i’m growing better i’ll go home” he went straight to his room at dussots’ hotel ordered supper and then undressed and as soon as his head touched the pillow fell into a sound sleep next day at eleven o’clock in the morning vronsky drove to the station of the petersburg railway to meet his mother and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was oblonsky who was expecting his sister by the same train “ah your excellency” cried oblonsky “whom are you meeting” “my mother” vronsky responded smiling as everyone did who met oblonsky he shook hands with him and together they ascended the steps “she is to be here from petersburg today” “i was looking out for you till two o’clock last night where did you go after the shtcherbatskys’” “home” answered vronsky “i must own i felt so well content yesterday after the shtcherbatskys’ that i didn’t care to go anywhere” “i know a gallant steed by tokens sure and by his eyes i know a youth in love” declaimed stepan arkadyevitch just as he had done before to levin vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it but he promptly changed the subject “and whom are you meeting” he asked “i i’ve come to meet a pretty woman” said oblonsky “you don’t say so” “honi soit qui mal y pense my sister anna” “ah that’s madame karenina” said vronsky “you know her no doubt” “i think i do or perhaps not  i really am not sure” vronsky answered heedlessly with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name karenina “but alexey alexandrovitch my celebrated brotherinlaw you surely must know all the world knows him” “i know him by reputation and by sight i know that he’s clever learned religious somewhat but you know that’s not  not in my line” said vronsky in english “yes he’s a very remarkable man rather a conservative but a splendid man” observed stepan arkadyevitch “a splendid man” “oh well so much the better for him” said vronsky smiling “oh you’ve come” he said addressing a tall old footman of his mother’s standing at the door “come here” besides the charm oblonsky had in general for everyone vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with kitty “well what do you say shall we give a supper on sunday for the diva” he said to him with a smile taking his arm “of course i’m collecting subscriptions oh did you make the acquaintance of my friend levin” asked stepan arkadyevitch “yes but he left rather early” “he’s a capital fellow” pursued oblonsky “isn’t he” “i don’t know why it is” responded vronsky “in all moscow people—present company of course excepted” he put in jestingly “there’s something uncompromising they are all on the defensive lose their tempers as though they all want to make one feel something” “yes that’s true it is so” said stepan arkadyevitch laughing goodhumoredly “will the train soon be in” vronsky asked a railway official “the train’s signaled” answered the man the approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station the rush of porters the movement of policemen and attendants and people meeting the train through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line the hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails and the rumble of something heavy “no” said stepan arkadyevitch who felt a great inclination to tell vronsky of levin’s intentions in regard to kitty “no you’ve not got a true impression of levin he’s a very nervous man and is sometimes out of humor it’s true but then he is often very nice he’s such a true honest nature and a heart of gold but yesterday there were special reasons” pursued stepan arkadyevitch with a meaning smile totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend and feeling the same sympathy now only for vronsky “yes there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy” vronsky stood still and asked directly “how so do you mean he made your bellesœur an offer yesterday” “maybe” said stepan arkadyevitch “i fancied something of the sort yesterday yes if he went away early and was out of humor too it must mean it he’s been so long in love and i’m very sorry for him” “so that’s it i should imagine though she might reckon on a better match” said vronsky drawing himself up and walking about again “though i don’t know him of course” he added “yes that is a hateful position that’s why most fellows prefer to have to do with klaras if you don’t succeed with them it only proves that you’ve not enough cash but in this case one’s dignity’s at stake but here’s the train” the engine had already whistled in the distance a few instants later the platform was quivering and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost the engine rolled up with the lever of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down and the stooping figure of the enginedriver covered with frost behind the tender setting the platform more and more slowly swaying came the luggage van with a dog whining in it at last the passenger carriages rolled in oscillating before coming to a standstill a smart guard jumped out giving a whistle and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down an officer of the guards holding himself erect and looking severely about him a nimble little merchant with a satchel smiling gaily a peasant with a sack over his shoulder vronsky standing beside oblonsky watched the carriages and the passengers totally oblivious of his mother what he had just heard about kitty excited and delighted him unconsciously he arched his chest and his eyes flashed he felt himself a conqueror “countess vronskaya is in that compartment” said the smart guard going up to vronsky the guard’s words roused him and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her he did not in his heart respect his mother and without acknowledging it to himself he did not love her though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived and with his own education he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient and the more externally obedient and respectful his behavior the less in his heart he respected and loved her vronsky followed the guard to the carriage and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out with the insight of a man of the world from one glance at this lady’s appearance vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society he begged pardon and was getting into the carriage but felt he must glance at her once more not that she was very beautiful not on account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure but because in the expression of her charming face as she passed close by him there was something peculiarly caressing and soft as he looked round she too turned her head her shining gray eyes that looked dark from the thick lashes rested with friendly attention on his face as though she were recognizing him and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd as though seeking someone in that brief look vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over her face and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips it was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes and now in her smile deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes but it shone against her will in the faintly perceptible smile vronsky stepped into the carriage his mother a driedup old lady with black eyes and ringlets screwed up her eyes scanning her son and smiled slightly with her thin lips getting up from the seat and handing her maid a bag she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss and lifting his head from her hand kissed him on the cheek “you got my telegram quite well thank god” “you had a good journey” said her son sitting down beside her and involuntarily listening to a woman’s voice outside the door he knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door “all the same i don’t agree with you” said the lady’s voice “it’s the petersburg view madame” “not petersburg but simply feminine” she responded “well well allow me to kiss your hand” “goodbye ivan petrovitch and could you see if my brother is here and send him to me” said the lady in the doorway and stepped back again into the compartment “well have you found your brother” said countess vronskaya addressing the lady vronsky understood now that this was madame karenina “your brother is here” he said standing up “excuse me i did not know you and indeed our acquaintance was so slight” said vronsky bowing “that no doubt you do not remember me” “oh no” said she “i should have known you because your mother and i have been talking i think of nothing but you all the way” as she spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile “and still no sign of my brother” “do call him alexey” said the old countess vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted “oblonsky here” madame karenina however did not wait for her brother but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light resolute step and as soon as her brother had reached her with a gesture that struck vronsky by its decision and its grace she flung her left arm around his neck drew him rapidly to her and kissed him warmly vronsky gazed never taking his eyes from her and smiled he could not have said why but recollecting that his mother was waiting for him he went back again into the carriage “she’s very sweet isn’t she” said the countess of madame karenina “her husband put her with me and i was delighted to have her we’ve been talking all the way and so you i hear  vous filez le parfait amour tant mieux mon cher tant mieux” “i don’t know what you are referring to maman” he answered coldly “come maman let us go” madame karenina entered the carriage again to say goodbye to the countess “well countess you have met your son and i my brother” she said “and all my gossip is exhausted i should have nothing more to tell you” “oh no” said the countess taking her hand “i could go all around the world with you and never be dull you are one of those delightful women in whose company it’s sweet to be silent as well as to talk now please don’t fret over your son you can’t expect never to be parted” madame karenina stood quite still holding herself very erect and her eyes were smiling “anna arkadyevna” the countess said in explanation to her son “has a little son eight years old i believe and she has never been parted from him before and she keeps fretting over leaving him” “yes the countess and i have been talking all the time i of my son and she of hers” said madame karenina and again a smile lighted up her face a caressing smile intended for him “i am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored” he said promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him but apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain and she turned to the old countess “thank you so much the time has passed so quickly goodbye countess” “goodbye my love” answered the countess “let me have a kiss of your pretty face i speak plainly at my age and i tell you simply that i’ve lost my heart to you” stereotyped as the phrase was madame karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it she flushed bent down slightly and put her cheek to the countess’s lips drew herself up again and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes she gave her hand to vronsky he pressed the little hand she gave him and was delighted as though at something special by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand she went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fullydeveloped figure with such strange lightness “very charming” said the countess that was just what her son was thinking his eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight and then the smile remained on his face he saw out of the window how she went up to her brother put her arm in his and began telling him something eagerly obviously something that had nothing to do with him vronsky and at that he felt annoyed “well maman are you perfectly well” he repeated turning to his mother “everything has been delightful alexander has been very good and marie has grown very pretty she’s very interesting” and she began telling him again of what interested her most—the christening of her grandson for which she had been staying in petersburg and the special favor shown her elder son by the tsar “here’s lavrenty” said vronsky looking out of the window “now we can go if you like” the old butler who had traveled with the countess came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready and the countess got up to go “come there’s not such a crowd now” said vronsky the maid took a handbag and the lap dog the butler and a porter the other baggage vronsky gave his mother his arm but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panicstricken faces the stationmaster too ran by in his extraordinary colored cap obviously something unusual had happened the crowd who had left the train were running back again “what what where flung himself crushed” was heard among the crowd stepan arkadyevitch with his sister on his arm turned back they too looked scared and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd the ladies got in while vronsky and stepan arkadyevitch followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster a guard either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost had not heard the train moving back and had been crushed before vronsky and oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler oblonsky and vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse oblonsky was evidently upset he frowned and seemed ready to cry “ah how awful ah anna if you had seen it ah how awful” he said vronsky did not speak his handsome face was serious but perfectly composed “oh if you had seen it countess” said stepan arkadyevitch “and his wife was there it was awful to see her she flung herself on the body they say he was the only support of an immense family how awful” “couldn’t one do anything for her” said madame karenina in an agitated whisper vronsky glanced at her and immediately got out of the carriage “i’ll be back directly maman” he remarked turning round in the doorway when he came back a few minutes later stepan arkadyevitch was already in conversation with the countess about the new singer while the countess was impatiently looking towards the door waiting for her son “now let us be off” said vronsky coming in they went out together vronsky was in front with his mother behind walked madame karenina with her brother just as they were going out of the station the stationmaster overtook vronsky “you gave my assistant two hundred roubles would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them” “for the widow” said vronsky shrugging his shoulders “i should have thought there was no need to ask” “you gave that” cried oblonsky behind and pressing his sister’s hand he added “very nice very nice isn’t he a splendid fellow goodbye countess” and he and his sister stood still looking for her maid when they went out the vronsky’s carriage had already driven away people coming in were still talking of what happened “what a horrible death” said a gentleman passing by “they say he was cut in two pieces” “on the contrary i think it’s the easiest—instantaneous” observed another “how is it they don’t take proper precautions” said a third madame karenina seated herself in the carriage and stepan arkadyevitch saw with surprise that her lips were quivering and she was with difficulty restraining her tears “what is it anna” he asked when they had driven a few hundred yards “it’s an omen of evil” she said “what nonsense” said stepan arkadyevitch “you’ve come that’s the chief thing you can’t conceive how i’m resting my hopes on you” “have you known vronsky long” she asked “yes you know we’re hoping he will marry kitty” “yes” said anna softly “come now let us talk of you” she added tossing her head as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her “let us talk of your affairs i got your letter and here i am” “yes all my hopes are in you” said stepan arkadyevitch “well tell me all about it” and stepan arkadyevitch began to tell his story on reaching home oblonsky helped his sister out sighed pressed her hand and set off to his office when anna went into the room dolly was sitting in the little drawingroom with a whiteheaded fat little boy already like his father giving him a lesson in french reading as the boy read he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket his mother had several times taken his hand from it but the fat little hand went back to the button again his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket “keep your hands still grisha” she said and she took up her work a coverlet she had long been making she always set to work on it at depressed moments and now she knitted at it nervously twitching her fingers and counting the stitches though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not she had made everything ready for her arrival and was expecting her sisterinlaw with emotion dolly was crushed by her sorrow utterly swallowed up by it still she did not forget that anna her sisterinlaw was the wife of one of the most important personages in petersburg and was a petersburg grande dame and thanks to this circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband—that is to say she remembered that her sisterinlaw was coming “and after all anna is in no wise to blame” thought dolly “i know nothing of her except the very best and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards myself” it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at petersburg at the karenins’ she did not like their household itself there was something artificial in the whole framework of their family life “but why should i not receive her if only she doesn’t take it into her head to console me” thought dolly “all consolation and counsel and christian forgiveness all that i have thought over a thousand times and it’s all no use” all these days dolly had been alone with her children she did not want to talk of her sorrow but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her his sister and of hearing her readymade phrases of good advice and comfort she had been on the lookout for her glancing at her watch every minute and as so often happens let slip just that minute when her visitor arrived so that she did not hear the bell catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door she looked round and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness but wonder she got up and embraced her sisterinlaw “what here already” she said as she kissed her “dolly how glad i am to see you” “i am glad too” said dolly faintly smiling and trying by the expression of anna’s face to find out whether she knew “most likely she knows” she thought noticing the sympathy in anna’s face “well come along i’ll take you to your room” she went on trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences “is this grisha heavens how he’s grown” said anna and kissing him never taking her eyes off dolly she stood still and flushed a little “no please let us stay here” she took off her kerchief and her hat and catching it in a lock of her black hair which was a mass of curls she tossed her head and shook her hair down “you are radiant with health and happiness” said dolly almost with envy “i yes” said anna “merciful heavens tanya you’re the same age as my seryozha” she added addressing the little girl as she ran in she took her in her arms and kissed her “delightful child delightful show me them all” she mentioned them not only remembering the names but the years months characters illnesses of all the children and dolly could not but appreciate that “very well we will go to them” she said “it’s a pity vassya’s asleep” after seeing the children they sat down alone now in the drawingroom to coffee anna took the tray and then pushed it away from her “dolly” she said “he has told me” dolly looked coldly at anna she was waiting now for phrases of conventional sympathy but anna said nothing of the sort “dolly dear” she said “i don’t want to speak for him to you nor to try to comfort you that’s impossible but darling i’m simply sorry sorry from my heart for you” under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered she moved nearer to her sisterinlaw and took her hand in her vigorous little hand dolly did not shrink away but her face did not lose its frigid expression she said “to comfort me’s impossible everything’s lost after what has happened everything’s over” and directly she had said this her face suddenly softened anna lifted the wasted thin hand of dolly kissed it and said “but dolly what’s to be done what’s to be done how is it best to act in this awful position—that’s what you must think of” “all’s over and there’s nothing more” said dolly “and the worst of all is you see that i can’t cast him off there are the children i am tied and i can’t live with him it’s a torture to me to see him” “dolly darling he has spoken to me but i want to hear it from you tell me about it” dolly looked at her inquiringly sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on anna’s face “very well” she said all at once “but i will tell you it from the beginning you know how i was married with the education mamma gave us i was more than innocent i was stupid i knew nothing i know they say men tell their wives of their former lives but stiva”—she corrected herself—“stepan arkadyevitch told me nothing you’ll hardly believe it but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known so i lived eight years you must understand that i was so far from suspecting infidelity i regarded it as impossible and then—try to imagine it—with such ideas to find out suddenly all the horror all the loathsomeness you must try and understand me to be fully convinced of one’s happiness and all at once” continued dolly holding back her sobs “to get a letter  his letter to his mistress my governess no it’s too awful” she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it “i can understand being carried away by feeling” she went on after a brief silence “but deliberately slyly deceiving me  and with whom to go on being my husband together with her  it’s awful you can’t understand” “oh yes i understand i understand dolly dearest i do understand” said anna pressing her hand “and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position” dolly resumed “not the slightest he’s happy and contented” “oh no” anna interposed quickly “he’s to be pitied he’s weighed down by remorse” “is he capable of remorse” dolly interrupted gazing intently into her sisterinlaw’s face “yes i know him i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him we both know him he’s goodhearted but he’s proud and now he’s so humiliated what touched me most” and here anna guessed what would touch dolly most “he’s tortured by two things that he’s ashamed for the children’s sake and that loving you—yes yes loving you beyond everything on earth” she hurriedly interrupted dolly who would have answered—“he has hurt you pierced you to the heart ‘no no she cannot forgive me’ he keeps saying” dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sisterinlaw as she listened to her words “yes i can see that his position is awful it’s worse for the guilty than the innocent” she said “if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault but how am i to forgive him how am i to be his wife again after her for me to live with him now would be torture just because i love my past love for him” and sobs cut short her words but as though of set design each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her “she’s young you see she’s pretty” she went on “do you know anna my youth and my beauty are gone taken by whom by him and his children i have worked for him and all i had has gone in his service and now of course any fresh vulgar creature has more charm for him no doubt they talked of me together or worse still they were silent do you understand” again her eyes glowed with hatred “and after that he will tell me what can i believe him never no everything is over everything that once made my comfort the reward of my work and my sufferings would you believe it i was teaching grisha just now once this was a joy to me now it is a torture what have i to strive and toil for why are the children here what’s so awful is that all at once my heart’s turned and instead of love and tenderness i have nothing but hatred for him yes hatred i could kill him” “darling dolly i understand but don’t torture yourself you are so distressed so overwrought that you look at many things mistakenly” dolly grew calmer and for two minutes both were silent “what’s to be done think for me anna help me i have thought over everything and i see nothing” anna could think of nothing but her heart responded instantly to each word to each change of expression of her sisterinlaw “one thing i would say” began anna “i am his sister i know his character that faculty of forgetting everything everything” she waved her hand before her forehead “that faculty for being completely carried away but for completely repenting too he cannot believe it he cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did” “no he understands he understood” dolly broke in “but i  you are forgetting me  does it make it easier for me” “wait a minute when he told me i will own i did not realize all the awfulness of your position i saw nothing but him and that the family was broken up i felt sorry for him but after talking to you i see it as a woman quite differently i see your agony and i can’t tell you how sorry i am for you but dolly darling i fully realize your sufferings only there is one thing i don’t know i don’t know  i don’t know how much love there is still in your heart for him that you know—whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him if there is forgive him” “no” dolly was beginning but anna cut her short kissing her hand once more “i know more of the world than you do” she said “i know how men like stiva look at it you speak of his talking of you with her that never happened such men are unfaithful but their home and wife are sacred to them somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them and do not touch on their feeling for their family they draw a sort of line that can’t be crossed between them and their families i don’t understand it but it is so” “yes but he has kissed her” “dolly hush darling i saw stiva when he was in love with you i remember the time when he came to me and cried talking of you and all the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you and i know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes you know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word ‘dolly’s a marvelous woman’ you have always been a divinity for him and you are that still and this has not been an infidelity of the heart” “but if it is repeated” “it cannot be as i understand it” “yes but could you forgive it” “i don’t know i can’t judge yes i can” said anna thinking a moment and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance she added “yes i can i can i can yes i could forgive it i could not be the same no but i could forgive it and forgive it as though it had never been never been at all” “oh of course” dolly interposed quickly as though saying what she had more than once thought “else it would not be forgiveness if one forgives it must be completely completely come let us go i’ll take you to your room” she said getting up and on the way she embraced anna “my dear how glad i am you came it has made things better ever so much better” the whole of that day anna spent at home that’s to say at the oblonskys’ and received no one though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival and came to call the same day anna spent the whole morning with dolly and the children she merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home “come god is merciful” she wrote oblonsky did dine at home the conversation was general and his wife speaking to him addressed him as “stiva” as she had not done before in the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still remained but there was no talk now of separation and stepan arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation immediately after dinner kitty came in she knew anna arkadyevna but only very slightly and she came now to her sister’s with some trepidation at the prospect of meeting this fashionable petersburg lady whom everyone spoke so highly of but she made a favorable impression on anna arkadyevna—she saw that at once anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth before kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under anna’s sway but in love with her as young girls do fall in love with older and married women anna was not like a fashionable lady nor the mother of a boy of eight years old in the elasticity of her movements the freshness and the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face and broke out in her smile and her glance she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her eyes which struck and attracted kitty kitty felt that anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing but that she had another higher world of interests inaccessible to her complex and poetic after dinner when dolly went away to her own room anna rose quickly and went up to her brother who was just lighting a cigar “stiva” she said to him winking gaily crossing him and glancing towards the door “go and god help you” he threw down the cigar understanding her and departed through the doorway when stepan arkadyevitch had disappeared she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt or that they felt a special charm in her themselves the two elder ones and the younger following their lead as children so often do had clung about their new aunt since before dinner and would not leave her side and it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt to touch her hold her little hand kiss it play with her ring or even touch the flounce of her skirt “come come as we were sitting before” said anna arkadyevna sitting down in her place and again grisha poked his little face under her arm and nestled with his head on her gown beaming with pride and happiness “and when is your next ball” she asked kitty “next week and a splendid ball one of those balls where one always enjoys oneself” “why are there balls where one always enjoys oneself” anna said with tender irony “it’s strange but there are at the bobrishtchevs’ one always enjoys oneself and at the nikitins’ too while at the mezhkovs’ it’s always dull haven’t you noticed it” “no my dear for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself” said anna and kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which was not open to her “for me there are some less dull and tiresome” “how can you be dull at a ball” “why should not i be dull at a ball” inquired anna kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow “because you always look nicer than anyone” anna had the faculty of blushing she blushed a little and said “in the first place it’s never so and secondly if it were what difference would it make to me” “are you coming to this ball” asked kitty “i imagine it won’t be possible to avoid going here take it” she said to tanya who was pulling the looselyfitting ring off her white slendertipped finger “i shall be so glad if you go i should so like to see you at a ball” “anyway if i do go i shall comfort myself with the thought that it’s a pleasure to you  grisha don’t pull my hair it’s untidy enough without that” she said putting up a straying lock which grisha had been playing with “i imagine you at the ball in lilac” “and why in lilac precisely” asked anna smiling “now children run along run along do you hear miss hoole is calling you to tea” she said tearing the children from her and sending them off to the diningroom “i know why you press me to come to the ball you expect a great deal of this ball and you want everyone to be there to take part in it” “how do you know yes” “oh what a happy time you are at” pursued anna “i remember and i know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in switzerland that mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending and out of that vast circle happy and gay there is a path growing narrower and narrower and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom bright and splendid as it is who has not been through it” kitty smiled without speaking “but how did she go through it how i should like to know all her love story” thought kitty recalling the unromantic appearance of alexey alexandrovitch her husband “i know something stiva told me and i congratulate you i liked him so much” anna continued “i met vronsky at the railway station” “oh was he there” asked kitty blushing “what was it stiva told you” “stiva gossiped about it all and i should be so glad  i traveled yesterday with vronsky’s mother” she went on “and his mother talked without a pause of him he’s her favorite i know mothers are partial but” “what did his mother tell you” “oh a great deal and i know that he’s her favorite still one can see how chivalrous he is well for instance she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child saved a woman out of the water he’s a hero in fact” said anna smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station but she did not tell kitty about the two hundred roubles for some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it she felt that there was something that had to do with her in it and something that ought not to have been “she pressed me very much to go and see her” anna went on “and i shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow stiva is staying a long while in dolly’s room thank god” anna added changing the subject and getting up kitty fancied displeased with something “no i’m first no i” screamed the children who had finished tea running up to their aunt anna “all together” said anna and she ran laughing to meet them and embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children shrieking with delight dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grownup people stepan arkadyevitch did not come out he must have left his wife’s room by the other door “i am afraid you’ll be cold upstairs” observed dolly addressing anna “i want to move you downstairs and we shall be nearer” “oh please don’t trouble about me” answered anna looking intently into dolly’s face trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not “it will be lighter for you here” answered her sisterinlaw “i assure you that i sleep everywhere and always like a marmot” “what’s the question” inquired stepan arkadyevitch coming out of his room and addressing his wife from his tone both kitty and anna knew that a reconciliation had taken place “i want to move anna downstairs but we must hang up blinds no one knows how to do it i must see to it myself” answered dolly addressing him “god knows whether they are fully reconciled” thought anna hearing her tone cold and composed “oh nonsense dolly always making difficulties” answered her husband “come i’ll do it all if you like” “yes they must be reconciled” thought anna “i know how you do everything” answered dolly “you tell matvey to do what can’t be done and go away yourself leaving him to make a muddle of everything” and her habitual mocking smile curved the corners of dolly’s lips as she spoke “full full reconciliation full” thought anna “thank god” and rejoicing that she was the cause of it she went up to dolly and kissed her “not at all why do you always look down on me and matvey” said stepan arkadyevitch smiling hardly perceptibly and addressing his wife the whole evening dolly was as always a little mocking in her tone to her husband while stepan arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful but not so as to seem as though having been forgiven he had forgotten his offense at halfpast nine o’clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the teatable at the oblonskys’ was broken up by an apparently simple incident but this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange talking about common acquaintances in petersburg anna got up quickly “she is in my album” she said “and by the way i’ll show you my seryozha” she added with a mother’s smile of pride towards ten o’clock when she usually said goodnight to her son and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself she felt depressed at being so far from him and whatever she was talking about she kept coming back in thought to her curlyheaded seryozha she longed to look at his photograph and talk of him seizing the first pretext she got up and with her light resolute step went for her album the stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase just as she was leaving the drawingroom a ring was heard in the hall “who can that be” said dolly “it’s early for me to be fetched and for anyone else it’s late” observed kitty “sure to be someone with papers for me” put in stepan arkadyevitch when anna was passing the top of the staircase a servant was running up to announce the visitor while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred in her heart he was standing still not taking off his coat pulling something out of his pocket at the instant when she was just facing the stairs he raised his eyes caught sight of her and into the expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and dismay with a slight inclination of her head she passed hearing behind her stepan arkadyevitch’s loud voice calling him to come up and the quiet soft and composed voice of vronsky refusing when anna returned with the album he was already gone and stepan arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived “and nothing would induce him to come up what a queer fellow he is” added stepan arkadyevitch kitty blushed she thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come and why he would not come up “he has been at home” she thought “and didn’t find me and thought i should be here but he did not come up because he thought it late and anna’s here” all of them looked at each other saying nothing and began to look at anna’s album there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man’s calling at halfpast nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in but it seemed strange to all of them above all it seemed strange and not right to anna the ball was only just beginning as kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase flooded with light and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats from the rooms came a constant steady hum as from a hive and the rustle of movement and while on the landing between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before the mirror they heard from the ballroom the careful distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz a little old man in civilian dress arranging his gray curls before another mirror and diffusing an odor of scent stumbled against them on the stairs and stood aside evidently admiring kitty whom he did not know a beardless youth one of those society youths whom the old prince shtcherbatsky called “young bucks” in an exceedingly open waistcoat straightening his white tie as he went bowed to them and after running by came back to ask kitty for a quadrille as the first quadrille had already been given to vronsky she had to promise this youth the second an officer buttoning his glove stood aside in the doorway and stroking his mustache admired rosy kitty although her dress her coiffure and all the preparations for the ball had cost kitty great trouble and consideration at this moment she walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace all the minute details of her attire had not cost her or her family a moment’s attention as though she had been born in that tulle and lace with her hair done up high on her head and a rose and two leaves on the top of it when just before entering the ballroom the princess her mother tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash kitty had drawn back a little she felt that everything must be right of itself and graceful and nothing could need setting straight it was one of kitty’s best days her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere her lace berthe did not droop anywhere her rosettes were not crushed nor torn off her pink slippers with high hollowedout heels did not pinch but gladdened her feet and the thick rolls of fair chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair all the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines the black velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck that velvet was delicious at home looking at her neck in the lookingglass kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking about all the rest there might be a doubt but the velvet was delicious kitty smiled here too at the ball when she glanced at it in the glass her bare shoulders and arms gave kitty a sense of chill marble a feeling she particularly liked her eyes sparkled and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own attractiveness she had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies all tulle ribbons lace and flowers waiting to be asked to dance—kitty was never one of that throng—when she was asked for a waltz and asked by the best partner the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom a renowned director of dances a married man handsome and wellbuilt yegorushka korsunsky he had only just left the countess bonina with whom he had danced the first half of the waltz and scanning his kingdom—that is to say a few couples who had started dancing—he caught sight of kitty entering and flew up to her with that peculiar easy amble which is confined to directors of balls without even asking her if she cared to dance he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist she looked round for someone to give her fan to and their hostess smiling to her took it “how nice you’ve come in good time” he said to her embracing her waist “such a bad habit to be late” bending her left hand she laid it on his shoulder and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly lightly and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music “it’s a rest to waltz with you” he said to her as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz “it’s exquisite—such lightness precision” he said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well she smiled at his praise and continued to look about the room over his shoulder she was not like a girl at her first ball for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland and she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome but she was in the middle stage between these two she was excited and at the same time she had sufficient selfpossession to be able to observe in the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together there—incredibly naked—was the beauty lidi korsunsky’s wife there was the lady of the house there shone the bald head of krivin always to be found where the best people were in that direction gazed the young men not venturing to approach there too she descried stiva and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown and he was there kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused levin with her longsighted eyes she knew him at once and was even aware that he was looking at her “another turn eh you’re not tired” said korsunsky a little out of breath “no thank you” “where shall i take you” “madame karenina’s here i think  take me to her” “wherever you command” and korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in the left corner continually saying “pardon mesdames pardon pardon mesdames” and steering his course through the sea of lace tulle and ribbon and not disarranging a feather he turned his partner sharply round so that her slim ankles in light transparent stockings were exposed to view and her train floated out in fan shape and covered krivin’s knees korsunsky bowed set straight his open shirt front and gave her his arm to conduct her to anna arkadyevna kitty flushed took her train from krivin’s knees and a little giddy looked round seeking anna anna was not in lilac as kitty had so urgently wished but in a black lowcut velvet gown showing her full throat and shoulders that looked as though carved in old ivory and her rounded arms with tiny slender wrists the whole gown was trimmed with venetian guipure on her head among her black hair—her own with no false additions—was a little wreath of pansies and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace her coiffure was not striking all that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples round her wellcut strong neck was a thread of pearls kitty had been seeing anna every day she adored her and had pictured her invariably in lilac but now seeing her in black she felt that she had not fully seen her charm she saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her now she understood that anna could not have been in lilac and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on her and her black dress with its sumptuous lace was not noticeable on her it was only the frame and all that was seen was she—simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and eager she was standing holding herself as always very erect and when kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house her head slightly turned towards him “no i don’t throw stones” she was saying in answer to something “though i can’t understand it” she went on shrugging her shoulders and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards kitty with a flying feminine glance she scanned her attire and made a movement of her head hardly perceptible but understood by kitty signifying approval of her dress and her looks “you came into the room dancing” she added “this is one of my most faithful supporters” said korsunsky bowing to anna arkadyevna whom he had not yet seen “the princess helps to make balls happy and successful anna arkadyevna a waltz” he said bending down to her “why have you met” inquired their host “is there anyone we have not met my wife and i are like white wolves—everyone knows us” answered korsunsky “a waltz anna arkadyevna” “i don’t dance when it’s possible not to dance” she said “but tonight it’s impossible” answered korsunsky at that instant vronsky came up “well since it’s impossible tonight let us start” she said not noticing vronsky’s bow and she hastily put her hand on korsunsky’s shoulder “what is she vexed with him about” thought kitty discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to vronsky’s bow vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille and expressing his regret that he had not seen her all this time kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing and listened to him she expected him to ask her for a waltz but he did not and she glanced wonderingly at him he flushed slightly and hurriedly asked her to waltz but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped kitty looked into his face which was so close to her own and long afterwards—for several years after—that look full of love to which he made no response cut her to the heart with an agony of shame “pardon pardon waltz waltz” shouted korsunsky from the other side of the room and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room after the first waltz kitty went to her mother and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordston when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he described very amusingly as delightful children at forty and of the future town theater and only once the conversation touched her to the quick when he asked her about levin whether he was here and added that he liked him so much but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille she looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka she fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her she felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she had done at former balls and refused five young men saying she was engaged for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors sounds and motions she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse she chanced to be visàvis with vronsky and anna she had not been near anna again since the beginning of the evening and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting she knew that feeling and knew its signs and saw them in anna saw the quivering flashing light in her eyes and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips and the deliberate grace precision and lightness of her movements “who” she asked herself “all or one” and not assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the grand rond and then into the chaîne and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart “no it’s not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her but the adoration of one and that one can it be he” every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes and the smile of happiness curved her red lips she seemed to make an effort to control herself to try not to show these signs of delight but they came out on her face of themselves “but what of him” kitty looked at him and was filled with terror what was pictured so clearly to kitty in the mirror of anna’s face she saw in him what had become of his always selfpossessed resolute manner and the carelessly serene expression of his face now every time he turned to her he bent his head as though he would have fallen at her feet and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread “i would not offend you” his eyes seemed every time to be saying “but i want to save myself and i don’t know how” on his face was a look such as kitty had never seen before they were speaking of common acquaintances keeping up the most trivial conversation but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers and strange it was that they were actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovitch was with his french and how the eletsky girl might have made a better match yet these words had all the while consequence for them and they were feeling just as kitty did the whole ball the whole world everything seemed lost in fog in kitty’s soul nothing but the stern discipline of her bringingup supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her that is to dance to answer questions to talk even to smile but before the mazurka when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room a moment of despair and horror came for kitty she had refused five partners and now she was not dancing the mazurka she had not even a hope of being asked for it because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home but she had not the strength to do this she felt crushed she went to the furthest end of the little drawingroom and sank into a low chair her light transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist one bare thin soft girlish arm hanging listlessly was lost in the folds of her pink tunic in the other she held her fan and with rapid short strokes fanned her burning face but while she looked like a butterfly clinging to a blade of grass and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight her heart ached with a horrible despair “but perhaps i am wrong perhaps it was not so” and again she recalled all she had seen “kitty what is it” said countess nordston stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her “i don’t understand it” kitty’s lower lip began to quiver she got up quickly “kitty you’re not dancing the mazurka” “no no” said kitty in a voice shaking with tears “he asked her for the mazurka before me” said countess nordston knowing kitty would understand who were “he” and “her” “she said ‘why aren’t you going to dance it with princess shtcherbatskaya’” “oh i don’t care” answered kitty no one but she herself understood her position no one knew that she had just refused the man whom perhaps she loved and refused him because she had put her faith in another countess nordston found korsunsky with whom she was to dance the mazurka and told him to ask kitty kitty danced in the first couple and luckily for her she had not to talk because korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure vronsky and anna sat almost opposite her she saw them with her longsighted eyes and saw them too close by when they met in the figures and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was complete she saw that they felt themselves alone in that crowded room and on vronsky’s face always so firm and independent she saw that look that had struck her of bewilderment and humble submissiveness like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong anna smiled and her smile was reflected by him she grew thoughtful and he became serious some supernatural force drew kitty’s eyes to anna’s face she was fascinating in her simple black dress fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of pearls fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair fascinating the graceful light movements of her little feet and hands fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness but there was something terrible and cruel in her fascination kitty admired her more than ever and more and more acute was her suffering kitty felt overwhelmed and her face showed it when vronsky saw her coming across her in the mazurka he did not at once recognize her she was so changed “delightful ball” he said to her for the sake of saying something “yes” she answered in the middle of the mazurka repeating a complicated figure newly invented by korsunsky anna came forward into the center of the circle chose two gentlemen and summoned a lady and kitty kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up anna looked at her with drooping eyelids and smiled pressing her hand but noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement she turned away from her and began gaily talking to the other lady “yes there is something uncanny devilish and fascinating in her” kitty said to herself anna did not mean to stay to supper but the master of the house began to press her to do so “nonsense anna arkadyevna” said korsunsky drawing her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat “i’ve such an idea for a cotillion un bijou” and he moved gradually on trying to draw her along with him their host smiled approvingly “no i am not going to stay” answered anna smiling but in spite of her smile both korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay “no why as it is i have danced more at your ball in moscow than i have all the winter in petersburg” said anna looking round at vronsky who stood near her “i must rest a little before my journey” “are you certainly going tomorrow then” asked vronsky “yes i suppose so” answered anna as it were wondering at the boldness of his question but the irrepressible quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it anna arkadyevna did not stay to supper but went home “yes there is something in me hateful repulsive” thought levin as he came away from the shtcherbatskys’ and walked in the direction of his brother’s lodgings “and i don’t get on with other people pride they say no i have no pride if i had any pride i should not have put myself in such a position” and he pictured to himself vronsky happy goodnatured clever and selfpossessed certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening “yes she was bound to choose him so it had to be and i cannot complain of anyone or anything i am myself to blame what right had i to imagine she would care to join her life to mine who am i and what am i a nobody not wanted by anyone nor of use to anybody” and he recalled his brother nikolay and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him “isn’t he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome and are we fair in our judgment of brother nikolay of course from the point of view of prokofy seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy he’s a despicable person but i know him differently i know his soul and know that we are like him and i instead of going to seek him out went out to dinner and came here” levin walked up to a lamppost read his brother’s address which was in his pocketbook and called a sledge all the long way to his brother’s levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother nikolay’s life he remembered how his brother while at the university and for a year afterwards had in spite of the jeers of his companions lived like a monk strictly observing all religious rites services and fasts and avoiding every sort of pleasure especially women and afterwards how he had all at once broken out he had associated with the most horrible people and rushed into the most senseless debauchery he remembered later the scandal over a boy whom he had taken from the country to bring up and in a fit of rage had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding then he recalled the scandal with a sharper to whom he had lost money and given a promissory note and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint asserting that he had cheated him this was the money sergey ivanovitch had paid then he remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street he remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother sergey ivanovitch accusing him of not having paid him his share of his mother’s fortune and the last scandal when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder it was all horribly disgusting yet to levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know nikolay did not know all his story did not know his heart levin remembered that when nikolay had been in the devout stage the period of fasts and monks and church services when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament everyone far from encouraging him had jeered at him and he too with the others they had teased him called him noah and monk and when he had broken out no one had helped him but everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust levin felt that in spite of all the ugliness of his life his brother nikolay in his soul in the very depths of his soul was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him he was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence but he had always wanted to be good “i will tell him everything without reserve and i will make him speak without reserve too and i’ll show him that i love him and so understand him” levin resolved to himself as towards eleven o’clock he reached the hotel of which he had the address “at the top 12 and 13” the porter answered levin’s inquiry “at home” “sure to be at home” the door of no 12 was half open and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap poor tobacco and the sound of a voice unknown to levin but he knew at once that his brother was there he heard his cough as he went in the door the unknown voice was saying “it all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing’s done” konstantin levin looked in at the door and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair wearing a russian jerkin and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown without collar or cuffs was sitting on the sofa his brother was not to be seen konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life no one had heard him and konstantin taking off his galoshes listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was saying he was speaking of some enterprise “well the devil flay them the privileged classes” his brother’s voice responded with a cough “masha get us some supper and some wine if there’s any left or else go and get some” the woman rose came out from behind the screen and saw konstantin “there’s some gentleman nikolay dmitrievitch” she said “whom do you want” said the voice of nikolay levin angrily “it’s i” answered konstantin levin coming forward into the light “who’s i” nikolay’s voice said again still more angrily he could be heard getting up hurriedly stumbling against something and levin saw facing him in the doorway the big scared eyes and the huge thin stooping figure of his brother so familiar and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness he was even thinner than three years before when konstantin levin had seen him last he was wearing a short coat and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever his hair had grown thinner the same straight mustaches hid his lips the same eyes gazed strangely and naïvely at his visitor “ah kostya” he exclaimed suddenly recognizing his brother and his eyes lit up with joy but the same second he looked round at the young man and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin knew so well as if his neckband hurt him and a quite different expression wild suffering and cruel rested on his emaciated face “i wrote to you and sergey ivanovitch both that i don’t know you and don’t want to know you what is it you want” he was not at all the same as konstantin had been fancying him the worst and most tiresome part of his character what made all relations with him so difficult had been forgotten by konstantin levin when he thought of him and now when he saw his face and especially that nervous twitching of his head he remembered it all “i didn’t want to see you for anything” he answered timidly “i’ve simply come to see you” his brother’s timidity obviously softened nikolay his lips twitched “oh so that’s it” he said “well come in sit down like some supper masha bring supper for three no stop a minute do you know who this is” he said addressing his brother and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin “this is mr kritsky my friend from kiev a very remarkable man he’s persecuted by the police of course because he’s not a scoundrel” and he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go he shouted to her “wait a minute i said” and with the inability to express himself the incoherence that konstantin knew so well he began with another look round at everyone to tell his brother kritsky’s story how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor students and sunday schools and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school and how he had been driven out of that too and had afterwards been condemned for something “you’re of the kiev university” said konstantin levin to kritsky to break the awkward silence that followed “yes i was of kiev” kritsky replied angrily his face darkening “and this woman” nikolay levin interrupted him pointing to her “is the partner of my life marya nikolaevna i took her out of a bad house” and he jerked his neck saying this “but i love her and respect her and anyone who wants to know me” he added raising his voice and knitting his brows “i beg to love her and respect her she’s just the same as my wife just the same so now you know whom you’ve to do with and if you think you’re lowering yourself well here’s the floor there’s the door” and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them “why i should be lowering myself i don’t understand” “then masha tell them to bring supper three portions spirits and wine no wait a minute no it doesn’t matter go along” “so you see” pursued nikolay levin painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do “here do you see” he pointed to some sort of iron bars fastened together with strings lying in a corner of the room “do you see that that’s the beginning of a new thing we’re going into it’s a productive association” konstantin scarcely heard him he looked into his sickly consumptive face and he was more and more sorry for him and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from selfcontempt nikolay levin went on talking “you know that capital oppresses the laborer the laborers with us the peasants bear all the burden of labor and are so placed that however much they work they can’t escape from their position of beasts of burden all the profits of labor on which they might improve their position and gain leisure for themselves and after that education all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists and society’s so constituted that the harder they work the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners while they stay beasts of burden to the end and that state of things must be changed” he finished up and he looked questioningly at his brother “yes of course” said konstantin looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother’s projecting cheekbones “and so we’re founding a locksmiths’ association where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common” “where is the association to be” asked konstantin levin “in the village of vozdrem kazan government” “but why in a village in the villages i think there is plenty of work as it is why a locksmiths’ association in a village” “why because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were and that’s why you and sergey ivanovitch don’t like people to try and get them out of their slavery” said nikolay levin exasperated by the objection konstantin levin sighed looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room this sigh seemed to exasperate nikolay still more “i know your and sergey ivanovitch’s aristocratic views i know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils” “no and what do you talk of sergey ivanovitch for” said levin smiling “sergey ivanovitch i’ll tell you what for” nikolay levin shrieked suddenly at the name of sergey ivanovitch “i’ll tell you what for but what’s the use of talking there’s only one thing what did you come to me for you look down on this and you’re welcome to—and go away in god’s name go away” he shrieked getting up from his chair “and go away and go away” “i don’t look down on it at all” said konstantin levin timidly “i don’t even dispute it” at that instant marya nikolaevna came back nikolay levin looked round angrily at her she went quickly to him and whispered something “i’m not well i’ve grown irritable” said nikolay levin getting calmer and breathing painfully “and then you talk to me of sergey ivanovitch and his article it’s such rubbish such lying such selfdeception what can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it have you read his article” he asked kritsky sitting down again at the table and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes so as to clear a space “i’ve not read it” kritsky responded gloomily obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation “why not” said nikolay levin now turning with exasperation upon kritsky “because i didn’t see the use of wasting my time over it” “oh but excuse me how did you know it would be wasting your time that article’s too deep for many people—that’s to say it’s over their heads but with me it’s another thing i see through his ideas and i know where its weakness lies” everyone was mute kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap “won’t you have supper all right goodbye come round tomorrow with the locksmith” kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolay levin smiled and winked “he’s no good either” he said “i see of course” but at that instant kritsky at the door called him “what do you want now” he said and went out to him in the passage left alone with marya nikolaevna levin turned to her “have you been long with my brother” he said to her “yes more than a year nikolay dmitrievitch’s health has become very poor nikolay dmitrievitch drinks a great deal” she said “that is  how does he drink” “drinks vodka and it’s bad for him” “and a great deal” whispered levin “yes” she said looking timidly towards the doorway where nikolay levin had reappeared “what were you talking about” he said knitting his brows and turning his scared eyes from one to the other “what was it” “oh nothing” konstantin answered in confusion “oh if you don’t want to say don’t only it’s no good your talking to her she’s a wench and you’re a gentleman” he said with a jerk of the neck “you understand everything i see and have taken stock of everything and look with commiseration on my shortcomings” he began again raising his voice “nikolay dmitrievitch nikolay dmitrievitch” whispered marya nikolaevna again going up to him “oh very well very well but where’s the supper ah here it is” he said seeing a waiter with a tray “here set it here” he added angrily and promptly seizing the vodka he poured out a glassful and drank it greedily “like a drink” he turned to his brother and at once became better humored “well enough of sergey ivanovitch i’m glad to see you anyway after all’s said and done we’re not strangers come have a drink tell me what you’re doing” he went on greedily munching a piece of bread and pouring out another glassful “how are you living” “i live alone in the country as i used to i’m busy looking after the land” answered konstantin watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank and trying to conceal that he noticed it “why don’t you get married” “it hasn’t happened so” konstantin answered reddening a little “why not for me now  everything’s at an end i’ve made a mess of my life but this i’ve said and i say still that if my share had been given me when i needed it my whole life would have been different” konstantin made haste to change the conversation “do you know your little vanya’s with me a clerk in the countinghouse at pokrovskoe” nikolay jerked his neck and sank into thought “yes tell me what’s going on at pokrovskoe is the house standing still and the birch trees and our schoolroom and philip the gardener is he living how i remember the arbor and the seat now mind and don’t alter anything in the house but make haste and get married and make everything as it used to be again then i’ll come and see you if your wife is nice” “but come to me now” said levin “how nicely we would arrange it” “i’d come and see you if i were sure i should not find sergey ivanovitch” “you wouldn’t find him there i live quite independently of him” “yes but say what you like you will have to choose between me and him” he said looking timidly into his brother’s face this timidity touched konstantin “if you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject i tell you that in your quarrel with sergey ivanovitch i take neither side you’re both wrong you’re more wrong externally and he inwardly” “ah ah you see that you see that” nikolay shouted joyfully “but i personally value friendly relations with you more because” “why why” konstantin could not say that he valued it more because nikolay was unhappy and needed affection but nikolay knew that this was just what he meant to say and scowling he took up the vodka again “enough nikolay dmitrievitch” said marya nikolaevna stretching out her plump bare arm towards the decanter “let it be don’t insist i’ll beat you” he shouted marya nikolaevna smiled a sweet and goodhumored smile which was at once reflected on nikolay’s face and she took the bottle “and do you suppose she understands nothing” said nikolay “she understands it all better than any of us isn’t it true there’s something good and sweet in her” “were you never before in moscow” konstantin said to her for the sake of saying something “only you mustn’t be polite and stiff with her it frightens her no one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of illfame mercy on us the senselessness in the world” he cried suddenly “these new institutions these justices of the peace rural councils what hideousness it all is” and he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions konstantin levin heard him and the disbelief in the sense of all public institutions which he shared with him and often expressed was distasteful to him now from his brother’s lips “in another world we shall understand it all” he said lightly “in another world ah i don’t like that other world i don’t like it” he said letting his scared eyes rest on his brother’s eyes “here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess one’s own and other people’s would be a good thing and yet i’m afraid of death awfully afraid of death” he shuddered “but do drink something would you like some champagne or shall we go somewhere let’s go to the gypsies do you know i have got so fond of the gypsies and russian songs” his speech had begun to falter and he passed abruptly from one subject to another konstantin with the help of masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere and got him to bed hopelessly drunk masha promised to write to konstantin in case of need and to persuade nikolay levin to go and stay with his brother in the morning konstantin levin left moscow and towards evening he reached home on the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors about politics and the new railways and just as in moscow he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas dissatisfaction with himself shame of something or other but when he got out at his own station when he saw his oneeyed coachman ignat with the collar of his coat turned up when in the dim light reflected by the station fires he saw his own sledge his own horses with their tails tied up in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels when the coachman ignat as he put in his luggage told him the village news that the contractor had arrived and that pava had calved—he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up and the shame and selfdissatisfaction were passing away he felt this at the mere sight of ignat and the horses but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him had sat down wrapped up in the sledge and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village and staring at the sidehorse that had been his saddlehorse past his prime now but a spirited beast from the don he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light he felt himself and did not want to be anyone else all he wanted now was to be better than before in the first place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary happiness such as marriage must have given him and consequently he would not so disdain what he really had secondly he would never again let himself give way to low passion the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make an offer then remembering his brother nikolay he resolved to himself that he would never allow himself to forget him that he would follow him up and not lose sight of him so as to be ready to help when things should go ill with him and that would be soon he felt then too his brother’s talk of communism which he had treated so lightly at the time now made him think he considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense but he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before he would now work still harder and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in the pleasantest daydreams with a resolute feeling of hope in a new better life he reached home before nine o’clock at night the snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the bedroom windows of his old nurse agafea mihalovna who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house she was not yet asleep kouzma waked up by her came sidling sleepily out onto the steps a setter bitch laska ran out too almost upsetting kouzma and whining turned round about levin’s knees jumping up and longing but not daring to put her forepaws on his chest “you’re soon back again sir” said agafea mihalovna “i got tired of it agafea mihalovna with friends one is well but at home one is better” he answered and went into his study the study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in the familiar details came out the stag’s horns the bookshelves the lookingglass the stove with its ventilator which had long wanted mending his father’s sofa a large table on the table an open book a broken ashtray a manuscript book with his handwriting as he saw all this there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life of which he had been dreaming on the road all these traces of his life seemed to clutch him and to say to him “no you’re not going to get away from us and you’re not going to be different but you’re going to be the same as you’ve always been with doubts everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself vain efforts to amend and falls and everlasting expectation of a happiness which you won’t get and which isn’t possible for you” this the things said to him but another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past and that one can do anything with oneself and hearing that voice he went into the corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells and began brandishing them like a gymnast trying to restore his confident temper there was a creak of steps at the door he hastily put down the dumbbells the bailiff came in and said everything thank god was doing well but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched this piece of news irritated levin the new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by levin the bailiff had always been against the drying machine and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched it was only because the precautions had not been taken for which he had hundreds of times given orders he was annoyed and reprimanded the bailiff but there had been an important and joyful event pava his best cow an expensive beast bought at a show had calved “kouzma give me my sheepskin and you tell them to take a lantern i’ll come and look at her” he said to the bailiff the cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house walking across the yard passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree he went into the cowhouse there was the warm steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened and the cows astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern stirred on the fresh straw he caught a glimpse of the broad smooth black and piebald back of hollandka berkoot the bull was lying down with his ring in his lip and seemed about to get up but thought better of it and only gave two snorts as they passed by him pava a perfect beauty huge as a hippopotamus with her back turned to them prevented their seeing the calf as she sniffed her all over levin went into the pen looked pava over and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long tottering legs pava uneasy began lowing but when levin put the calf close to her she was soothed and sighing heavily began licking her with her rough tongue the calf fumbling poked her nose under her mother’s udder and stiffened her tail out straight “here bring the light fyodor this way” said levin examining the calf “like the mother though the color takes after the father but that’s nothing very good long and broad in the haunch vassily fedorovitch isn’t she splendid” he said to the bailiff quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf “how could she fail to be oh semyon the contractor came the day after you left you must settle with him konstantin dmitrievitch” said the bailiff “i did inform you about the machine” this question was enough to take levin back to all the details of his work on the estate which was on a large scale and complicated he went straight from the cowhouse to the counting house and after a little conversation with the bailiff and semyon the contractor he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawingroom the house was big and oldfashioned and levin though he lived alone had the whole house heated and used he knew that this was stupid he knew that it was positively not right and contrary to his present new plans but this house was a whole world to levin it was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died they had lived just the life that to levin seemed the ideal of perfection and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife his family levin scarcely remembered his mother his conception of her was for him a sacred memory and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been he was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family his ideas of marriage were consequently quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life for levin it was the chief affair of life on which its whole happiness turned and now he had to give up that when he had gone into the little drawingroom where he always had tea and had settled himself in his armchair with a book and agafea mihalovna had brought him tea and with her usual “well i’ll stay a while sir” had taken a chair in the window he felt that however strange it might be he had not parted from his daydreams and that he could not live without them whether with her or with another still it would be he was reading a book and thinking of what he was reading and stopping to listen to agafea mihalovna who gossiped away without flagging and yet with all that all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his imagination he felt that in the depth of his soul something had been put in its place settled down and laid to rest he heard agafea mihalovna talking of how prohor had forgotten his duty to god and with the money levin had given him to buy a horse had been drinking without stopping and had beaten his wife till he’d half killed her he listened and read his book and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his reading it was tyndall’s treatise on heat he recalled his own criticisms of tyndall of his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments and for his lack of philosophic insight and suddenly there floated into his mind the joyful thought “in two years’ time i shall have two dutch cows pava herself will perhaps still be alive a dozen young daughters of berkoot and the three others—how lovely” he took up his book again “very good electricity and heat are the same thing but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the solution of any problem no well then what of it the connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively it’s particulary nice if pava’s daughter should be a redspotted cow and all the herd will take after her and the other three too splendid to go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd my wife says ‘kostya and i looked after that calf like a child’ ‘how can it interest you so much’ says a visitor ‘everything that interests him interests me’ but who will she be” and he remembered what had happened at moscow “well there’s nothing to be done it’s not my fault but now everything shall go on in a new way it’s nonsense to pretend that life won’t let one that the past won’t let one one must struggle to live better much better” he raised his head and fell to dreaming old laska who had not yet fully digested her delight at his return and had run out into the yard to bark came back wagging her tail and crept up to him bringing in the scent of fresh air put her head under his hand and whined plaintively asking to be stroked “there who’d have thought it” said agafea mihalovna “the dog now  why she understands that her master’s come home and that he’s lowspirited” “why lowspirited” “do you suppose i don’t see it sir it’s high time i should know the gentry why i’ve grown up from a little thing with them it’s nothing sir so long as there’s health and a clear conscience” levin looked intently at her surprised at how well she knew his thought “shall i fetch you another cup” said she and taking his cup she went out laska kept poking her head under his hand he stroked her and she promptly curled up at his feet laying her head on a hindpaw and in token of all now being well and satisfactory she opened her mouth a little smacked her lips and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth she sank into blissful repose levin watched all her movements attentively “that’s what i’ll do” he said to himself “that’s what i’ll do nothing’s amiss all’s well” after the ball early next morning anna arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving moscow the same day “no i must go i must go” she explained to her sisterinlaw the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them “no it had really better be today” stepan arkadyevitch was not dining at home but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven o’clock kitty too did not come sending a note that she had a headache dolly and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess whether it was that the children were fickle or that they had acute senses and felt that anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her that she was not now interested in them—but they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt and their love for her and were quite indifferent that she was going away anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances put down her accounts and packed altogether dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind but in that worried mood which dolly knew well with herself and which does not come without cause and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self after dinner anna went up to her room to dress and dolly followed her “how queer you are today” dolly said to her “i do you think so i’m not queer but i’m nasty i am like that sometimes i keep feeling as if i could cry it’s very stupid but it’ll pass off” said anna quickly and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs her eyes were particularly bright and were continually swimming with tears “in the same way i didn’t want to leave petersburg and now i don’t want to go away from here” “you came here and did a good deed” said dolly looking intently at her anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears “don’t say that dolly i’ve done nothing and could do nothing i often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me what have i done and what could i do in your heart there was found love enough to forgive” “if it had not been for you god knows what would have happened how happy you are anna” said dolly “everything is clear and good in your heart” “every heart has its own skeletons as the english say” “you have no sort of skeleton have you everything is so clear in you” “i have” said anna suddenly and unexpectedly after her tears a sly ironical smile curved her lips “come he’s amusing anyway your skeleton and not depressing” said dolly smiling “no he’s depressing do you know why i’m going today instead of tomorrow it’s a confession that weighs on me i want to make it to you” said anna letting herself drop definitely into an armchair and looking straight into dolly’s face and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears up to the curly black ringlets on her neck “yes” anna went on “do you know why kitty didn’t come to dinner she’s jealous of me i have spoiled  i’ve been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure but truly truly it’s not my fault or only my fault a little bit” she said daintily drawling the words “a little bit” “oh how like stiva you said that” said dolly laughing anna was hurt “oh no oh no i’m not stiva” she said knitting her brows “that’s why i’m telling you just because i could never let myself doubt myself for an instant” said anna but at the very moment she was uttering the words she felt that they were not true she was not merely doubting herself she felt emotion at the thought of vronsky and was going away sooner than she had meant simply to avoid meeting him “yes stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him and that he” “you can’t imagine how absurdly it all came about i only meant to be matchmaking and all at once it turned out quite differently possibly against my own will” she crimsoned and stopped “oh they feel it directly” said dolly “but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side” anna interrupted her “and i am certain it will all be forgotten and kitty will leave off hating me” “all the same anna to tell you the truth i’m not very anxious for this marriage for kitty and it’s better it should come to nothing if he vronsky is capable of falling in love with you in a single day” “oh heavens that would be too silly” said anna and again a deep flush of pleasure came out on her face when she heard the idea that absorbed her put into words “and so here i am going away having made an enemy of kitty whom i liked so much ah how sweet she is but you’ll make it right dolly eh” dolly could scarcely suppress a smile she loved anna but she enjoyed seeing that she too had her weaknesses “an enemy that can’t be” “i did so want you all to care for me as i do for you and now i care for you more than ever” said anna with tears in her eyes “ah how silly i am today” she passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing at the very moment of starting stepan arkadyevitch arrived late rosy and goodhumored smelling of wine and cigars anna’s emotionalism infected dolly and when she embraced her sisterinlaw for the last time she whispered “remember anna what you’ve done for me—i shall never forget and remember that i love you and shall always love you as my dearest friend” “i don’t know why” said anna kissing her and hiding her tears “you understood me and you understand goodbye my darling” “come it’s all over and thank god” was the first thought that came to anna arkadyevna when she had said goodbye for the last time to her brother who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang she sat down on her lounge beside annushka and looked about her in the twilight of the sleepingcarriage “thank god tomorrow i shall see seryozha and alexey alexandrovitch and my life will go on in the old way all nice and as usual” still in the same anxious frame of mind as she had been all that day anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care with her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag took out a cushion laid it on her knees and carefully wrapping up her feet settled herself comfortably an invalid lady had already lain down to sleep two other ladies began talking to anna and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet and made observations about the heating of the train anna answered a few words but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation she asked annushka to get a lamp hooked it onto the arm of her seat and took from her bag a paperknife and an english novel at first her reading made no progress the fuss and bustle were disturbing then when the train had started she could not help listening to the noises then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane and the sight of the muffled guard passing by covered with snow on one side and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside distracted her attention farther on it was continually the same again and again the same shaking and rattling the same snow on the window the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold and back again to heat the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight and the same voices and anna began to read and to understand what she read annushka was already dozing the red bag on her lap clutched by her broad hands in gloves of which one was torn anna arkadyevna read and understood but it was distasteful to her to read that is to follow the reflection of other people’s lives she had too great a desire to live herself if she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man if she read of a member of parliament making a speech she longed to be delivering the speech if she read of how lady mary had ridden after the hounds and had provoked her sisterinlaw and had surprised everyone by her boldness she too wished to be doing the same but there was no chance of doing anything and twisting the smooth paperknife in her little hands she forced herself to read the hero of the novel was already almost reaching his english happiness a baronetcy and an estate and anna was feeling a desire to go with him to the estate when she suddenly felt that he ought to feel ashamed and that she was ashamed of the same thing but what had he to be ashamed of “what have i to be ashamed of” she asked herself in injured surprise she laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair tightly gripping the papercutter in both hands there was nothing she went over all her moscow recollections all were good pleasant she remembered the ball remembered vronsky and his face of slavish adoration remembered all her conduct with him there was nothing shameful and for all that at the same point in her memories the feeling of shame was intensified as though some inner voice just at the point when she thought of vronsky were saying to her “warm very warm hot” “well what is it” she said to herself resolutely shifting her seat in the lounge “what does it mean am i afraid to look it straight in the face why what is it can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist or can exist any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance” she laughed contemptuously and took up her book again but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read she passed the paperknife over the window pane then laid its smooth cool surface to her cheek and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her she felt as though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg she felt her eyes opening wider and wider her fingers and toes twitching nervously something within oppressing her breathing while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain halflight to strike her with unaccustomed vividness moments of doubt were continually coming upon her when she was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards or were standing still altogether whether it were annushka at her side or a stranger “what’s that on the arm of the chair a fur cloak or some beast and what am i myself myself or some other woman” she was afraid of giving way to this delirium but something drew her towards it and she could yield to it or resist it at will she got up to rouse herself and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress for a moment she regained her selfpossession and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat with buttons missing from it was the stoveheater that he was looking at the thermometer that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door but then everything grew blurred again that peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall the old lady began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage and filling it with a black cloud then there was a fearful shrieking and banging as though someone were being torn to pieces then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything anna felt as though she were sinking down but it was not terrible but delightful the voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her ear she got up and pulled herself together she realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard she asked annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl put them on and moved towards the door “do you wish to get out” asked annushka “yes i want a little air it’s very hot in here” and she opened the door the driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled with her over the door but she enjoyed the struggle she opened the door and went out the wind seemed as though lying in wait for her with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear her off but she clung to the cold door post and holding her skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages the wind had been powerful on the steps but on the platform under the lee of the carriages there was a lull with enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen snowy air and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station the raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages about the scaffolding and round the corner of the station the carriages posts people everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side and was getting more and more thickly covered for a moment there would come a lull in the storm but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it meanwhile men ran to and fro talking merrily together their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors the bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron “hand over that telegram” came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side “this way no 28” several different voices shouted again and muffled figures ran by covered with snow two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her she drew one more deep breath of the fresh air and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage when another man in a military overcoat quite close beside her stepped between her and the flickering light of the lamp post she looked round and the same instant recognized vronsky’s face putting his hand to the peak of his cap he bowed to her and asked was there anything she wanted could he be of any service to her she gazed rather a long while at him without answering and in spite of the shadow in which he was standing she saw or fancied she saw both the expression of his face and his eyes it was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before more than once she had told herself during the past few days and again only a few moments before that vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men forever exactly the same that are met everywhere that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him but now at the first instant of meeting him she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride she had no need to ask why he had come she knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was here to be where she was “i didn’t know you were going what are you coming for” she said letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post and irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face “what am i coming for” he repeated looking straight into her eyes “you know that i have come to be where you are” he said “i can’t help it” at that moment the wind as it were surmounting all obstacles sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front plaintively and gloomily all the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now he had said what her soul longed to hear though she feared it with her reason she made no answer and in her face he saw conflict “forgive me if you dislike what i said” he said humbly he had spoken courteously deferentially yet so firmly so stubbornly that for a long while she could make no answer “it’s wrong what you say and i beg you if you’re a good man to forget what you’ve said as i forget it” she said at last “not one word not one gesture of yours shall i could i ever forget” “enough enough” she cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her face into which he was gazing greedily and clutching at the cold door post she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of the carriage but in the little corridor she paused going over in her imagination what had happened though she could not recall her own words or his she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer and she was panicstricken and blissful at it after standing still a few seconds she went into the carriage and sat down in her place the overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come back but was intensified and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension she did not sleep all night but in that nervous tension and in the visions that filled her imagination there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy on the contrary there was something blissful glowing and exhilarating towards morning anna sank into a doze sitting in her place and when she waked it was daylight and the train was near petersburg at once thoughts of home of husband and of son and the details of that day and the following came upon her at petersburg as soon as the train stopped and she got out the first person that attracted her attention was her husband “oh mercy why do his ears look like that” she thought looking at his frigid and imposing figure and especially the ears that struck her at the moment as propping up the brim of his round hat catching sight of her he came to meet her his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile and his big tired eyes looking straight at her an unpleasant sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary glance as though she had expected to see him different she was especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experienced on meeting him that feeling was an intimate familiar feeling like a consciousness of hypocrisy which she experienced in her relations with her husband but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling now she was clearly and painfully aware of it “yes as you see your tender spouse as devoted as the first year after marriage burned with impatience to see you” he said in his deliberate highpitched voice and in that tone which he almost always took with her a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he said “is seryozha quite well” she asked “and is this all the reward” said he “for my ardor he’s quite well” vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night he sat in his armchair looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out if he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure he seemed now more haughty and selfpossessed than ever he looked at people as if they were things a nervous young man a clerk in a law court sitting opposite him hated him for that look the young man asked him for a light and entered into conversation with him and even pushed against him to make him feel that he was not a thing but a person but vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp and the young man made a wry face feeling that he was losing his selfpossession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as a person vronsky saw nothing and no one he felt himself a king not because he believed that he had made an impression on anna—he did not yet believe that—but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride what would come of it all he did not know he did not even think he felt that all his forces hitherto dissipated wasted were centered on one thing and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal and he was happy at it he knew only that he had told her the truth that he had come where she was that all the happiness of his life the only meaning in life for him now lay in seeing and hearing her and when he got out of the carriage at bologova to get some seltzer water and caught sight of anna involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought and he was glad he had told her it that she knew it now and was thinking of it he did not sleep all night when he was back in the carriage he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had seen her every word she had uttered and before his fancy making his heart faint with emotion floated pictures of a possible future when he got out of the train at petersburg he felt after his sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath he paused near his compartment waiting for her to get out “once more” he said to himself smiling unconsciously “once more i shall see her walk her face she will say something turn her head glance smile maybe” but before he caught sight of her he saw her husband whom the stationmaster was deferentially escorting through the crowd “ah yes the husband” only now for the first time did vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to her a husband he knew that she had a husband but had hardly believed in his existence and only now fully believed in him with his head and shoulders and his legs clad in black trousers especially when he saw this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property seeing alexey alexandrovitch with his petersburg face and severely selfconfident figure in his round hat with his rather prominent spine he believed in him and was aware of a disagreeable sensation such as a man might feel tortured by thirst who on reaching a spring should find a dog a sheep or a pig who has drunk of it and muddied the water alexey alexandrovitch’s manner of walking with a swing of the hips and flat feet particularly annoyed vronsky he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her but she was still the same and the sight of her affected him the same way physically reviving him stirring him and filling his soul with rapture he told his german valet who ran up to him from the second class to take his things and go on and he himself went up to her he saw the first meeting between the husband and wife and noted with a lover’s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her husband “no she does not love him and cannot love him” he decided to himself at the moment when he was approaching anna arkadyevna he noticed too with joy that she was conscious of his being near and looked round and seeing him turned again to her husband “have you passed a good night” he asked bowing to her and her husband together and leaving it up to alexey alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his own account and to recognize it or not as he might see fit “thank you very good” she answered her face looked weary and there was not that play of eagerness in it peeping out in her smile and her eyes but for a single instant as she glanced at him there was a flash of something in her eyes and although the flash died away at once he was happy for that moment she glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew vronsky alexey alexandrovitch looked at vronsky with displeasure vaguely recalling who this was vronsky’s composure and selfconfidence here struck like a scythe against a stone upon the cold selfconfidence of alexey alexandrovitch “count vronsky” said anna “ah we are acquainted i believe” said alexey alexandrovitch indifferently giving his hand “you set off with the mother and you return with the son” he said articulating each syllable as though each were a separate favor he was bestowing “you’re back from leave i suppose” he said and without waiting for a reply he turned to his wife in his jesting tone “well were a great many tears shed at moscow at parting” by addressing his wife like this he gave vronsky to understand that he wished to be left alone and turning slightly towards him he touched his hat but vronsky turned to anna arkadyevna “i hope i may have the honor of calling on you” he said alexey alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at vronsky “delighted” he said coldly “on mondays we’re at home most fortunate” he said to his wife dismissing vronsky altogether “that i should just have half an hour to meet you so that i can prove my devotion” he went on in the same jesting tone “you lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much” she responded in the same jesting tone involuntarily listening to the sound of vronsky’s steps behind them “but what has it to do with me” she said to herself and she began asking her husband how seryozha had got on without her “oh capitally mariette says he has been very good and  i must disappoint you  but he has not missed you as your husband has but once more merci my dear for giving me a day our dear samovar will be delighted” he used to call the countess lidia ivanovna well known in society a samovar because she was always bubbling over with excitement “she has been continually asking after you and do you know if i may venture to advise you you should go and see her today you know how she takes everything to heart just now with all her own cares she’s anxious about the oblonskys being brought together” the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her husband’s and the center of that one of the coteries of the petersburg world with which anna was through her husband in the closest relations “but you know i wrote to her” “still she’ll want to hear details go and see her if you’re not too tired my dear well kondraty will take you in the carriage while i go to my committee i shall not be alone at dinner again” alexey alexandrovitch went on no longer in a sarcastic tone “you wouldn’t believe how i’ve missed” and with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile he put her in her carriage the first person to meet anna at home was her son he dashed down the stairs to her in spite of the governess’s call and with desperate joy shrieked “mother mother” running up to her he hung on her neck “i told you it was mother” he shouted to the governess “i knew” and her son like her husband aroused in anna a feeling akin to disappointment she had imagined him better than he was in reality she had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was but even as he was he was charming with his fair curls his blue eyes and his plump graceful little legs in tightly pulledup stockings anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of his nearness and his caresses and moral soothing when she met his simple confiding and loving glance and heard his naïve questions anna took out the presents dolly’s children had sent him and told her son what sort of little girl was tanya at moscow and how tanya could read and even taught the other children “why am i not so nice as she” asked seryozha “to me you’re nicer than anyone in the world” “i know that” said seryozha smiling anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the countess lidia ivanovna was announced the countess lidia ivanovna was a tall stout woman with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid pensive black eyes anna liked her but today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time with all her defects “well my dear so you took the olive branch” inquired countess lidia ivanovna as soon as she came into the room  “yes it’s all over but it was all much less serious than we had supposed” answered anna “my bellesœur is in general too hasty”  but countess lidia ivanovna though she was interested in everything that did not concern her had a habit of never listening to what interested her she interrupted anna  “yes there’s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world i am so worried today”  “oh why” asked anna trying to suppress a smile  “i’m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth and sometimes i’m quite unhinged by it the society of the little sisters” this was a religiouslypatriotic philanthropic institution “was going splendidly but with these gentlemen it’s impossible to do anything” added countess lidia ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny “they pounce on the idea and distort it and then work it out so pettily and unworthily two or three people your husband among them understand all the importance of the thing but the others simply drag it down yesterday pravdin wrote to me”  pravdin was a wellknown panslavist abroad and countess lidia ivanovna described the purport of his letter  then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches and departed in haste as she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the slavonic committee  “it was all the same before of course but why was it i didn’t notice it before” anna asked herself “or has she been very much irritated today it’s really ludicrous her object is doing good she a christian yet she’s always angry and she always has enemies and always enemies in the name of christianity and doing good”  after countess lidia ivanovna another friend came the wife of a chief secretary who told her all the news of the town at three o’clock she too went away promising to come to dinner alexey alexandrovitch was at the ministry anna left alone spent the time till dinner in assisting at her son’s dinner he dined apart from his parents and in putting her things in order and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her table  the feeling of causeless shame which she had felt on the journey and her excitement too had completely vanished in the habitual conditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable  she recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day “what was it nothing vronsky said something silly which it was easy to put a stop to and i answered as i ought to have done to speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question to speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance” she remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at petersburg by a young man one of her husband’s subordinates and how alexey alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact and could never lower her and himself by jealousy “so then there’s no reason to speak of it and indeed thank god there’s nothing to speak of” she told herself    alexey alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four o’clock but as often happened he had not time to come in to her he went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary at dinner time there were always a few people dining with the karenins there arrived an old lady a cousin of alexey alexandrovitch the chief secretary of the department and his wife and a young man who had been recommended to alexey alexandrovitch for the service anna went into the drawingroom to receive these guests precisely at five o’clock before the bronze peter the first clock had struck the fifth stroke alexey alexandrovitch came in wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars as he had to go out directly after dinner every minute of alexey alexandrovitch’s life was portioned out and occupied and to make time to get through all that lay before him every day he adhered to the strictest punctuality “unhasting and unresting” was his motto he came into the dining hall greeted everyone and hurriedly sat down smiling to his wife  “yes my solitude is over you wouldn’t believe how uncomfortable” he laid stress on the word uncomfortable “it is to dine alone”  at dinner he talked a little to his wife about moscow matters and with a sarcastic smile asked her after stepan arkadyevitch but the conversation was for the most part general dealing with petersburg official and public news after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests and again with a smile pressed his wife’s hand withdrew and drove off to the council anna did not go out that evening either to the princess betsy tverskaya who hearing of her return had invited her nor to the theater where she had a box for that evening she did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not ready altogether anna on turning after the departure of her guests to the consideration of her attire was very much annoyed she was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense and before leaving moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform the dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized and they ought to have been ready three days before it appeared that two dresses had not been done at all while the other one had not been altered as anna had intended the dressmaker came to explain declaring that it would be better as she had done it and anna was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards to regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son put him to bed herself signed him with the cross and tucked him up she was glad she had not gone out anywhere and had spent the evening so well she felt so lighthearted and serene she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so important on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable life and that she had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself anna sat down at the hearth with an english novel and waited for her husband exactly at halfpast nine she heard his ring and he came into the room  “here you are at last” she observed holding out her hand to him  he kissed her hand and sat down beside her  “altogether then i see your visit was a success” he said to her  “oh yes” she said and she began telling him about everything from the beginning her journey with countess vronskaya her arrival the accident at the station then she described the pity she had felt first for her brother and afterwards for dolly  “i imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame though he is your brother” said alexey alexandrovitch severely  anna smiled she knew that he said that simply to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine opinion she knew that characteristic in her husband and liked it  “i am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily and that you are back again” he went on “come what do they say about the new act i have got passed in the council”  anna had heard nothing of this act and she felt consciencestricken at having been able so readily to forget what was to him of such importance  “here on the other hand it has made a great sensation” he said with a complacent smile  she saw that alexey alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant to him about it and she brought him by questions to telling it with the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in consequence of the act he had passed  “i was very very glad it shows that at last a reasonable and steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us”  having drunk his second cup of tea with cream and bread alexey alexandrovitch got up and was going towards his study  “and you’ve not been anywhere this evening you’ve been dull i expect” he said  “oh no” she answered getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study “what are you reading now” she asked  “just now i’m reading duc de lille poésie des enfers” he answered “a very remarkable book”  anna smiled as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love and putting her hand under his she escorted him to the door of the study she knew his habit that had grown into a necessity of reading in the evening she knew too that in spite of his official duties which swallowed up almost the whole of his time he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world she knew too that he was really interested in books dealing with politics philosophy and theology that art was utterly foreign to his nature but in spite of this or rather in consequence of it alexey alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art but made it his duty to read everything she knew that in politics in philosophy in theology alexey alexandrovitch often had doubts and made investigations but on questions of art and poetry and above all of music of which he was totally devoid of understanding he had the most distinct and decided opinions he was fond of talking about shakespeare raphael beethoven of the significance of new schools of poetry and music all of which were classified by him with very conspicuous consistency  “well god be with you” she said at the door of the study where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair “and i’ll write to moscow”  he pressed her hand and again kissed it  “all the same he’s a good man truthful goodhearted and remarkable in his own line” anna said to herself going back to her room as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one could not love him “but why is it his ears stick out so strangely or has he had his hair cut”  precisely at twelve o’clock when anna was still sitting at her writingtable finishing a letter to dolly she heard the sound of measured steps in slippers and alexey alexandrovitch freshly washed and combed with a book under his arm came in to her  “it’s time it’s time” said he with a meaning smile and he went into their bedroom  “and what right had he to look at him like that” thought anna recalling vronsky’s glance at alexey alexandrovitch  undressing she went into the bedroom but her face had none of the eagerness which during her stay in moscow had fairly flashed from her eyes and her smile on the contrary now the fire seemed quenched in her hidden somewhere far away    when vronsky went to moscow from petersburg he had left his large set of rooms in morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade petritsky  petritsky was a young lieutenant not particularly wellconnected and not merely not wealthy but always hopelessly in debt towards evening he was always drunk and he had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scandals but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers on arriving at twelve o’clock from the station at his flat vronsky saw at the outer door a hired carriage familiar to him while still outside his own door as he rang he heard masculine laughter the lisp of a feminine voice and petritsky’s voice “if that’s one of the villains don’t let him in” vronsky told the servant not to announce him and slipped quietly into the first room baroness shilton a friend of petritsky’s with a rosy little face and flaxen hair resplendent in a lilac satin gown and filling the whole room like a canary with her parisian chatter sat at the round table making coffee petritsky in his overcoat and the cavalry captain kamerovsky in full uniform probably just come from duty were sitting each side of her  “bravo vronsky” shouted petritsky jumping up scraping his chair “our host himself baroness some coffee for him out of the new coffee pot why we didn’t expect you hope you’re satisfied with the ornament of your study” he said indicating the baroness “you know each other of course”  “i should think so” said vronsky with a bright smile pressing the baroness’s little hand “what next i’m an old friend”  “you’re home after a journey” said the baroness “so i’m flying oh i’ll be off this minute if i’m in the way”  “you’re home wherever you are baroness” said vronsky “how do you do kamerovsky” he added coldly shaking hands with kamerovsky  “there you never know how to say such pretty things” said the baroness turning to petritsky  “no what’s that for after dinner i say things quite as good”  “after dinner there’s no credit in them well then i’ll make you some coffee so go and wash and get ready” said the baroness sitting down again and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot “pierre give me the coffee” she said addressing petritsky whom she called pierre as a contraction of his surname making no secret of her relations with him “i’ll put it in”  “you’ll spoil it”  “no i won’t spoil it well and your wife” said the baroness suddenly interrupting vronsky’s conversation with his comrade “we’ve been marrying you here have you brought your wife”  “no baroness i was born a bohemian and a bohemian i shall die”  “so much the better so much the better shake hands on it”  and the baroness detaining vronsky began telling him with many jokes about her last new plans of life asking his advice  “he persists in refusing to give me a divorce well what am i to do” he was her husband “now i want to begin a suit against him what do you advise kamerovsky look after the coffee it’s boiling over you see i’m engrossed with business i want a lawsuit because i must have my property do you understand the folly of it that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him” she said contemptuously “he wants to get the benefit of my fortune”  vronsky heard with pleasure this lighthearted prattle of a pretty woman agreed with her gave her halfjoking counsel and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women in his petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed classes one the lower class vulgar stupid and above all ridiculous people who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully married that a girl should be innocent a woman modest and a man manly selfcontrolled and strong that one ought to bring up one’s children earn one’s bread and pay one’s debts and various similar absurdities this was the class of oldfashioned and ridiculous people but there was another class of people the real people to this class they all belonged and in it the great thing was to be elegant generous plucky gay to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion and to laugh at everything else  for the first moment only vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite different world that he had brought with him from moscow but immediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers he dropped back into the lighthearted pleasant world he had always lived in  the coffee was never really made but spluttered over everyone and boiled away doing just what was required of it—that is providing much cause for much noise and laughter and spoiling a costly rug and the baroness’s gown  “well now goodbye or you’ll never get washed and i shall have on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit so you would advise a knife to his throat”  “to be sure and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips he’ll kiss your hand and all will end satisfactorily” answered vronsky  “so at the français” and with a rustle of her skirts she vanished  kamerovsky got up too and vronsky not waiting for him to go shook hands and went off to his dressingroom  while he was washing petritsky described to him in brief outlines his position as far as it had changed since vronsky had left petersburg no money at all his father said he wouldn’t give him any and pay his debts his tailor was trying to get him locked up and another fellow too was threatening to get him locked up the colonel of the regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to leave as for the baroness he was sick to death of her especially since she’d taken to offering continually to lend him money but he had found a girl—he’d show her to vronsky—a marvel exquisite in the strict oriental style “genre of the slave rebecca don’t you know” he’d had a row too with berkoshov and was going to send seconds to him but of course it would come to nothing altogether everything was supremely amusing and jolly and not letting his comrade enter into further details of his position petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news as he listened to petritsky’s familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in vronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless petersburg life that he was used to  “impossible” he cried letting down the pedal of the washing basin in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck “impossible” he cried at the news that laura had flung over fertinghof and had made up to mileev “and is he as stupid and pleased as ever well and how’s buzulukov”  “oh there is a tale about buzulukov—simply lovely” cried petritsky “you know his weakness for balls and he never misses a single court ball he went to a big ball in a new helmet have you seen the new helmets very nice lighter well so he’s standing no i say do listen”  “i am listening” answered vronsky rubbing himself with a rough towel  “up comes the grand duchess with some ambassador or other and as illluck would have it she begins talking to him about the new helmets the grand duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the ambassador they see our friend standing there” petritsky mimicked how he was standing with the helmet “the grand duchess asked him to give her the helmet he doesn’t give it to her what do you think of that well everyone’s winking at him nodding frowning—give it to her do he doesn’t give it to her he’s mute as a fish only picture it well the  what’s his name whatever he was  tries to take the helmet from him  he won’t give it up he pulls it from him and hands it to the grand duchess ‘here your highness’ says he ‘is the new helmet’ she turned the helmet the other side up and—just picture it—plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it two pounds of sweetmeats he’d been storing them up the darling”  vronsky burst into roars of laughter and long afterwards when he was talking of other things he broke out into his healthy laugh showing his strong close rows of teeth when he thought of the helmet  having heard all the news vronsky with the assistance of his valet got into his uniform and went off to report himself he intended when he had done that to drive to his brother’s and to betsy’s and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he might meet madame karenina as he always did in petersburg he left home not meaning to return till late at night
