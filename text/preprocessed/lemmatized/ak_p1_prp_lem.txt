pull down his shirtcuff distribute into his pocket his cigarette pocketbook match and watch with its double chain and seal and shake out his handkerchief feel himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his unhappiness he walk with a slight swing on each leg into the diningroom where coffee be already wait for he and beside the coffee letter and paper from the office he read the letter one be very unpleasant from a merchant who be buy a forest on his wife ’s property to sell this forest be absolutely essential but at present until he be reconcile with his wife the subject could not be discuss the most unpleasant thing of all be that his pecuniary interest should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be lead on by his interest that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest — that idea hurt he when he have finish his letter stepan arkadyevitch move the officepaper close to he rapidly look through two piece of business make a few note with a big pencil and push away the paper turn to his coffee as he sip his coffee he open a still damp morning paper and begin read it stepan arkadyevitch take in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocate the view hold by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politic have no special interest for he he firmly hold those view on all these subject which be hold by the majority and by his paper and he only change they when the majority change they — or more strictly speak he do not change they but they imperceptibly change of themselves within he stepan arkadyevitch have not choose his political opinion or his view these political opinion and view have come to he of themselves just as he do not choose the shape of his hat and coat but simply take those that be be wear and for he live in a certain society — owe to the need ordinarily develop at year of discretion for some degree of mental activity — to have view be just as indispensable as to have a hat if there be a reason for his prefer liberal to conservative view which be hold also by many of his circle it arise not from his consider liberalism more rational but from its be in close accordance with his manner of life the liberal party say that in russia everything be wrong and certainly stepan arkadyevitch have many debt and be decidedly short of money the liberal party say that marriage be an institution quite out of date and that it need reconstruction and family life certainly afford stepan arkadyevitch little gratification and force he into lying and hypocrisy which be so repulsive to his nature the liberal party say or rather allow it to be understand that religion be only a curb to keep in check the barbarous class of the people and stepan arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his leg ache from stand up and could never make out what be the object of all the terrible and highflown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevitch who like a joke be fond of puzzle a plain man by say that if he pride himself on his origin he ought not to stop at rurik and disown the first founder of his family — the monkey and so liberalism have become a habit of stepan arkadyevitch ’s and he like his newspaper as he do his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffuse in his brain he read the leading article in which it be maintain that it be quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism be threaten to swallow up all conservative element and that the government ought to take measure to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary  in our opinion the danger lie not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clog progress  etc etc he read another article too a financial one which allude to bentham and mill and drop some innuendo reflect on the ministry with his characteristic quickwittedness he catch the drift of each innuendo divine whence it come at whom and on what ground it be aim and that afford he as it always do a certain satisfaction but today that satisfaction be embitter by matrona philimonovna ’s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household he read too that count beist be rumor to have leave for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seek a situation but these item of information do not give he as usual a quiet ironical gratification have finish the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he get up shake the crumb of the roll off his waistcoat and square his broad chest he smile joyously not because there be anything particularly agreeable in his mind — the joyous smile be evoke by a good digestion but this joyous smile at once recall everything to he and he grow thoughtful two childish

legible hand a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to she have get rid of the staff captain ’s widow stepan arkadyevitch take his hat and stop to recollect whether he have forget anything it appear that he have forget nothing except what he want to forget — his wife  ah yes  he bow his head and his handsome face assume a harassed expression  to go or not to go  he say to himself and an inner voice tell he he must not go that nothing could come of it but falsity that to amend to set right their relation be impossible because it be impossible to make she attractive again and able to inspire love or to make he an old man not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now and deceit and lying be oppose to his nature  it must be

school thank to his excellent ability but he have be idle and mischievous and therefore be one of the low in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipate mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupy the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government board at moscow this post he have receive through his sister anna ’s husband alexey alexandrovitch karenin who hold one of the most important position in the ministry to whose department the moscow office belong but if karenin have not get his brotherinlaw this berth then through a hundred other personage — brother sister cousin uncle and aunt — stiva oblonsky would have receive this post or some other similar one together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for he as his affair in spite of his wife ’s considerable property be in an embarrassed condition half moscow and petersburg be friend and relation of stepan arkadyevitch he be bear in the midst of those who have be and be the powerful one of this world onethird of the man in the government the old man have be friend of his father ’s and have know he in petticoat another third be his intimate chum and the remainder be friendly acquaintance consequently the distributor of earthly blessing in the shape of place rent share and such be all his friend and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky have no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he have only not to refuse thing not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never do it would have strike he as absurd if he have be tell that he would not get a position with the salary he require especially as he expect nothing out of the way he only want what the man of his own age and standing do get and he be no worse qualified for perform duty of the kind than any other man stepan arkadyevitch be not merely like you all who know he for his good humor but for his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in he in his handsome radiant figure his sparkle eye black hair and eyebrow and the white and red of his face there be something which produce a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who meet he  aha stiva oblonsky here he be  be almost always say with a smile of delight on meet he even though it happen at time that after a conversation with he it seem that nothing particularly delightful have happen the next day and the next everyone be just as delighted at meet he again after fill for three year the post of president of one of the government board at moscow stepan arkadyevitch have win the respect as well as the liking of his fellowofficial subordinate and superior and all who have have business with he the principal quality in stepan arkadyevitch which have gain he this universal respect in the service consist in the first place of his extreme indulgence for other found on a consciousness of his own shortcoming secondly of his perfect liberalism — not the liberalism he read of in the paper but the liberalism that be in his blood in virtue of which he treat all man perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or calling might be and thirdly — the most important point — his complete indifference to the business in which he be engage in consequence of which he be never carry away and never make mistake on reach the office of the board stepan arkadyevitch escort by a deferential porter with a portfolio go into his little private room put on his uniform and go into the boardroom the clerk and you all rise greet he with goodhumored deference stepan arkadyevitch move quickly as ever to his place shake hand with his colleague and sit down he make a joke or two and talk just as much as be consistent with due decorum and begin work no one know well than stepan arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom simplicity and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the goodhumored deference common to everyone in stepan arkadyevitch ’s office come up with paper and begin to speak in the familiar and easy tone which have be introduce by stepan arkadyevitch  we have succeed in get the information from the government department of penza here would you care   you ’ve get they at last  say stepan arkadyevitch lay his finger on the paper  now gentleman  and the sitting of the board begin  if they know  he think bend his head with a significant air as he listen to the report  what a guilty little boy their president be half an hour ago  and his eye be laugh during the reading of the report till two o’clock the sitting would go on without a break and at two o’clock there would be an interval and luncheon it be not yet two when the large glass door of the boardroom suddenly open and someone come in all the official sit on the further side under the portrait of the tsar and the eagle delight at any distraction look round at the door but the doorkeeper stand at the door at once drive out the intruder and close the glass door after he when the case have be read through

veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevitch go in with he  we shall have time to finish after lunch  say stepan arkadyevitch  to be sure we shall  say nikitin  a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be  say grinevitch of one of the person take part in the case they be examine stepan arkadyevitch frown at grinevitch ’s word give he thereby to understand that it be improper to pass judgment prematurely and make he no reply  who be that come in  he ask the doorkeeper  someone your excellency creep in without permission directly my back be turn he be ask for you i tell he when the member come out then   where be he   maybe he ’ go into the passage but here he come anyway that be he  say the doorkeeper point to a strongly build broadshouldered man with a curly beard who without take off his sheepskin cap be run lightly and rapidly up the worn step of the stone staircase one of the member go down — a lean official with a portfolio — stand out of his way and look disapprovingly at the leg of the stranger then glance inquiringly at oblonsky stepan arkadyevitch be stand at the top of the stair his goodnaturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beam more than ever when he recognize the man come up  why it ’ actually you levin at last  he say with a friendly mocking smile scan levin as he approach  how be it you have deign to look i up in this den  say stepan arkadyevitch and not content with shake hand he kiss his friend  have you be here long   i have just come and very much want to see you  say levin look shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around  well let ’s go into my room  say stepan arkadyevitch who know his friend ’s sensitive and irritable shyness and take his arm he draw he along as though guide he through danger stepan arkadyevitch be on familiar term with almost all his acquaintance and call almost all of they by their christian name old man of sixty boy of twenty actor minister merchant and adjutantgeneral so that many of his intimate chum be to be find at the extreme end of the social ladder and would have be very much surprised to learn that they have through the medium of oblonsky something in common he be the familiar friend of everyone with whom he take a glass of champagne and he take a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he meet any of his disreputable chum as he use in joke to call many of his friend in the presence of his subordinate he well know how with his characteristic tact to diminish the disagreeable impression make on they levin be not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact feel that levin fancy he might not care to show his intimacy with he before his subordinate and so he make haste to take he off into his room levin be almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy do not rest merely on champagne levin have be the friend and companion of his early youth they be fond of one another in spite of the difference of their character and taste as friend be fond of one another who have be together in early youth but in spite of this each of they — as be often the way with man who have select career of different kind — though in discussion he would even justify the other ’s career in his heart despise it it seem to each of they that the life he lead himself be the only real life and the life lead by his friend be a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he have see he come up to moscow from the country where he be do something but what precisely stepan arkadyevitch could never quite make out and indeed he take no interest in the matter levin arrive in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of thing stepan arkadyevitch laugh at this and like it in the same way levin in his heart despise the town mode of life of his friend and his official duty which he laugh at and regard as trifling but the difference be that oblonsky as he be do the same as everyone do laugh complacently and goodhumoredly while levin laugh without complacency and sometimes angrily  we have long be expect you  say stepan arkadyevitch go into his room and let levin ’s hand go as though to show that here all danger be over  i be very very glad to see you  he go on  well how be you eh when do you come  levin be silent look at the unknown face of oblonsky ’s two companion and especially at the hand of the elegant grinevitch which have such long white finger such long yellow filbertshaped nail and such huge shining stud on the shirtcuff that apparently they absorb all his attention and allow he no freedom of thought oblonsky notice this at once and smile  ah to be sure let i introduce you  he say  my colleague philip ivanitch nikitin mihail stanislavitch grinevitch”—and turn to levin—“a district councilor a modern district councilman a gymnast who lift thirteen stone with one hand a cattlebreeder and sportsman and my friend konstantin dmitrievitch levin the brother of sergey ivanovitch koznishev   delighted  say the veteran  i have the honor of know your brother sergey ivanovitch  say grinevitch hold out his slender hand with its long nail levin frown shake hand coldly and at once turn to oblonsky though he have a great respect for his halfbrother an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treat he not as konstantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev  no i be no long a district councilor i have quarrel with they all and do not go to the meeting any more  he say turn to oblonsky  you ’ve be quick about it  say oblonsky with a smile  but how why   it ’ a long story i will tell you some time  say levin but he begin tell he at once  well to put it shortly i be convinced that nothing be really do by the district council or ever could be  he begin as though someone have just insult he  on one side it ’ a plaything they play at be a parliament and i ’m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in plaything and on the other side  he stammer  it ’ a means for the coterie of the district to make money formerly they have wardship court of justice now they have the district council — not in the form of bribe but in the form of unearned salary  he say as hotly as though someone of those present have oppose his opinion  aha you ’re in a new phase again i see — a conservative  say stepan arkadyevitch  however we can go into that later   yes later but i want to see you  say levin look with hatred at grinevitch ’s hand stepan arkadyevitch give a scarcely perceptible smile  how be it you use to say you would never wear european dress again  he say scan his new suit obviously cut by a french tailor  ah i see a new phase  levin suddenly blush not as grown man blush slightly without be themselves aware of it but as boy blush feel that they be ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blush still more almost to the point of tear and it be so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky leave off look at he  oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you  say levin oblonsky seem to ponder  i ’ll tell you what let ’s go to gurin ’s to lunch and there we can talk i be free

to say and a question i want to ask you and we can have a talk afterwards   well say the few word then at once and we ’ll gossip after dinner   well it ’ this  say levin  but it ’ of no importance though  his face all at once take an expression of anger from the effort he be make to surmount his shyness  what be the shtcherbatskys do everything as it use to be  he say stepan arkadyevitch who have long know that levin be in love with his sisterinlaw kitty give a hardly perceptible smile and his eye sparkle merrily  you say a few word but i can not answer in a few word because excuse i a minute  a secretary come in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business he go up to oblonsky with some paper and begin under pretense of ask a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevitch without hear he out lay his hand genially on the secretary ’s sleeve  no you do as i tell you  he say soften his word with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turn away from the paper and say  so do it that way if you please zahar nikititch  the secretary retire in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin have completely recover from his embarrassment he be stand with his elbow on the back of a chair and on his face be a look of ironical attention  i do not understand it i do not understand it  he say  what do not you understand  say oblonsky smile as brightly as ever and pick up a cigarette he expect some queer outburst from levin  i do not understand what you be do  say levin shrug his shoulder  how can you do it seriously   why not   why because there ’ nothing in it   you think so but we ’re overwhelmed with work   on paper but there you ’ve a gift for it  add levin  that ’ to say you think there ’ a lack of something in i   perhaps so  say levin  but all the same i admire your grandeur and be proud that i ’ve a friend in such a great person you ’ve not answer my question though  he go on with a desperate effort look oblonsky straight in the face  oh that ’ all very well you wait a bit and you ’ll come to this yourself it ’ very nice for you to have over six thousand acre in the karazinsky district and such muscle and the freshness of a girl of twelve still you ’ll be one of we one day yes as to your question there be no change but it ’ a pity you ’ve be away so long   oh why so  levin query panicstricken  oh nothing  respond oblonsky  we ’ll talk it over but what ’ bring you up to town   oh we ’ll talk about that too later on  say levin redden again up to his ear  all right i see  say stepan arkadyevitch  i should ask you to come to we you know but my wife ’ not quite the thing but i tell you what if you want to see they they ’re sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skate you drive along there and i ’ll come and fetch you and we ’ll go and dine somewhere together   capital so goodbye till then   now mind you ’ll forget i know you or rush off home to the country  stepan arkadyevitch call out laugh  no truly  and levin go out of the room only when he be in the doorway remember that he have forget to take leave of oblonsky ’s colleague  that gentleman must be a man of great energy  say grinevitch when levin have go away  yes my dear boy  say stepan arkadyevitch nod his head  he ’ a lucky fellow over six thousand acre in the karazinsky district everything before he and what youth and vigor not like some of we   you have a great deal to complain of have not you stepan arkadyevitch   ah yes i ’m in a poor way a bad way  say stepan arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh when oblonsky ask levin what have bring he to town levin blush and be furious with himself for blush because he could not answer  i have come to make your sisterinlaw an offer  though that be precisely what he have come for the family of the levins and the shtcherbatskys be old noble moscow family and have always be on intimate and friendly term this intimacy have grow still close during levin ’s student day he have both prepare for the university with the young prince shtcherbatsky the brother of kitty and dolly and have enter at the same time with he in those day levin use often to be in the shtcherbatskys  house and he be in love with the shtcherbatsky household strange as it may appear it be with the household the family that konstantin levin be in love especially with the feminine half of the household levin do not remember his own mother and his only sister be old than he be so that it be in the shtcherbatskys  house that he see for the first time that inner life of an old noble cultivated and honorable family of which he have be deprive by the death of his father and mother all the member of that family especially the feminine half be picture by he as it be wrap about with a mysterious poetical veil and he not only perceive no defect whatever in they but under the poetical veil that shroud they he assume the existence of the lofty sentiment and every possible perfection why it be the three young lady have one day to speak french and the next english why it be that at certain hour they play by turn on the piano the sound of which be audible in their brother ’s room above where the student use to work why they be visit by those professor of french literature of music of drawing of dancing why at certain hour all the three young lady with mademoiselle linon drive in the coach to the tversky boulevard dress in their satin cloak dolly in a long one natalia in a halflong one and kitty in one so short that her shapely leg in tightlydrawn red stocking be visible to all beholder why it be they have to walk about the tversky boulevard escort by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat — all this and much more that be do in their mysterious world he do not understand but he be sure that everything that be do there be very good and he be in love precisely with the mystery of the proceeding in his student day he have all but be in love with the eld dolly but she be soon marry to oblonsky then he begin be in love with the second he feel as it be that he have to be in love with one of the sister only he could not quite make out which but natalia too have hardly make her appearance in the world when she marry the diplomat lvov kitty be still a child when levin leave the university young shtcherbatsky go into the navy be drown in the baltic and levin ’s relation with the shtcherbatskys in spite of his friendship with oblonsky become less intimate but when early in the winter of this year levin come to moscow after a year in the country and see the shtcherbatskys he realize which of the three sister he be indeed destine to love one would have think that nothing could be simple than for he a man of good family rather rich than poor and thirtytwo year old to make the young princess shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage in all likelihood he would at once have be look upon as a good match but levin be in love and so it seem to he that kitty be so perfect in every respect that she be a creature far above everything earthly and that he be a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceive that other people and she herself could regard he as worthy of she after spend two month in moscow in a state of enchantment see kitty almost every day in society into which he go so as to meet she he abruptly decide that it could not be and go back to the country levin ’s conviction that it could not be be found on the idea that in the eye of her family he be a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming kitty and that kitty herself could not love he in her family ’s eye he have no ordinary definite career and position in society while his contemporary by this time when he be thirtytwo be already one a colonel and another a professor another director of a bank and railway or president of a board like oblonsky but he he know very well how he must appear to other be a country gentleman occupy in breed cattle shoot game and build barn in other word a fellow of no ability who have not turn out well and who be do just what accord to the idea of the world be do by people fit for nothing else the mysterious enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceive himself to be and above all such an ordinary in no way striking person moreover his attitude to kitty in the past — the attitude of a grownup person to a child arise from his friendship with her brother — seem to he yet another obstacle to love an ugly goodnatured man as he consider himself might he suppose be like as a friend but to be love with such a love as that with which he love kitty one would need to be a handsome and still more a distinguished man he have hear that woman often do care for ugly and ordinary man but he do not believe it for he judge by himself and he could not himself have love any but beautiful mysterious and exceptional woman but after spend two month alone in the country he be convince that this be not one of those passion of which he have have experience in his early youth that this feeling give he not an instant ’s rest that he could not live without decide the question would she or would she not be his wife and that his despair have arise only from his own imagining that he have no sort of proof that he would be reject and he have now come to moscow with a firm determination to make an offer and get marry if he be accept or   he could not conceive what would become of he if he be reject on arrive in moscow by a morning train levin have put up at the house of his elder halfbrother koznishev after change his clothe he go down to his brother ’s study intend to talk to he at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother be not alone with he there be a wellknown professor of philosophy who have come from harkov expressly to clear up a difference that have arise between they on a very important philosophical question the professor be carry on a hot crusade against materialist sergey koznishev have be follow this crusade with interest and after read the professor ’s last article he have write he a letter state his objection he accuse the professor of make too great concession to the materialist and the professor have promptly appear to argue the matter out the point in discussion be the question then in vogue be there a line to be draw between psychological and physiological phenomenon in man and if so where sergey ivanovitch meet his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always have for everyone and introduce he to the professor go on with the conversation a little man in spectacle with a narrow forehead tear himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then go on talk without pay any further attention to he levin sit down to wait till the professor should go but he soon begin to get interested in the subject under discussion levin have come across the magazine article about which they be dispute and have read they interested in they as a development of the first principle of science familiar to he as a natural science student at the university but he have never connect these scientific deduction as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those question as to the meaning of life and death to himself which have of late be more and more often in his mind as he listen to his brother ’s argument with the professor he notice that they connect these scientific question with those spiritual problem that at time they almost touch on the latter but every time they be close upon what seem to he the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunge again into a sea of subtle distinction reservation quotation allusion and appeal to authority and it be with difficulty that he understand what they be talk about  i can not admit it  say sergey ivanovitch with his habitual clearness precision of expression and elegance of phrase  i can not in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world have be derive from perception the most fundamental idea the idea of existence have not be receive by i through sensation indeed there be no special senseorgan for the transmission of such an idea   yes but they — wurt and knaust and pripasov — would answer that your consciousness of existence be derive from the conjunction of all your sensation that that consciousness of existence be the result of your sensation wurt indeed say plainly that assume there be no sensation it follow that there be no idea of existence   i maintain the contrary  begin sergey ivanovitch but here it seem to levin that just as they be close upon the real point of the matter they be again retreat and he make up his mind to put a question to the professor  accord to that if my sense be annihilate if my body be dead i can have no existence of any sort  he query the professor in annoyance and as it be mental suffering at the interruption look round at the strange inquirer more like a bargeman than a philosopher and turn his eye upon sergey ivanovitch as though to ask what ’ one to say to he but sergey ivanovitch who have be talk with far less heat and onesidedness than the professor and who have sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question be put smile and say  that question we have no right to answer as yet   we have not the requisite datum  chime in the professor and he go back to his argument  no  he say  i would point out the fact that if as pripasov directly assert perception be base on sensation then we be bind to distinguish sharply between these two conception  levin listen no more and simply wait for the professor to go when the professor have go sergey ivanovitch turn to his brother  delighted that you ’ve come for some time be it how ’ your farming get on  levin know that his eld brother take little interest in farming and only put the question in deference to he and so he only tell he about the sale of his wheat and money matter levin have mean to tell his brother of his determination to get marry and to ask his advice he have indeed firmly resolve to do so but after see his brother listen to his conversation with the professor hear afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother question he about agricultural matter their mother ’s property have not be divide and levin take charge of both their share levin feel that he could not for some reason begin to talk to he of his intention of marry he feel that his brother would not look at it as he would have wish he to  well how be your district council do  ask sergey ivanovitch who be greatly interested in these local board and attach great importance to they  i really do not know   what why surely you ’re a member of the board   no i ’m not a member now i ’ve resign  answer levin  and i no long attend the meeting   what a pity  comment sergey ivanovitch frown levin in selfdefense begin to describe what take place in the meeting in his district  that ’ how it always be  sergey ivanovitch interrupt he  we russians be always like that perhaps it ’ our strong point really the faculty of see our own shortcoming but we overdo it we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongue all i say be give such right as our local selfgovernment to any other european people — why the germans or the english would have work their way to freedom from they while we simply turn they into ridicule   but how can it be help  say levin penitently  it be my last effort and i do try with all my soul i can n’t i ’m no good at it   it ’ not that you ’re no good at it  say sergey ivanovitch  it be that you do not look at it as you should   perhaps not  levin answer dejectedly  oh do you know brother nikolay ’ turn up again  this brother nikolay be the eld brother of konstantin levin and halfbrother of sergey ivanovitch a man utterly ruin who have dissipate the great part of his fortune be live in the strange and low company and have quarrel with his brother  what do you say  levin cry with horror  how do you know   prokofy see he in the street   here in moscow where be he do you know  levin get up from his chair as though on the point of start off at once  i be sorry i tell you  say sergey ivanovitch shake his head at his young brother ’s excitement  i send to find out where he be live and send he his iou to trubin which i pay this be the answer he send i  and sergey ivanovitch take a note from under a paperweight and hand it to his brother levin read in the queer familiar handwriting  i humbly beg you to leave i in peace that ’ the only favor i ask of my gracious brother — nikolay levin  levin read it and without raise his head stand with the note in his hand opposite sergey ivanovitch there be a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time and the consciousness that it would be base to do so  he obviously want to offend i  pursue sergey ivanovitch  but he can not offend i and i should have wish with all my heart to assist he but i know it ’ impossible to do that   yes yes  repeat levin  i understand and appreciate your attitude to he but i shall go and see he   if you want to do but i should not advise it  say sergey ivanovitch  as regard myself i have no fear of your do so he will not make you quarrel with i but for your own sake i should say you would do well not to go you can not do he any good still do as you please   very likely i can not do any good but i feel — especially at such a moment — but that ’ another thing — i feel i could not be at peace   well that i do not understand  say sergey ivanovitch  one thing i do understand  he add  it ’ a lesson in humility i have come to look very differently and more charitably on what be call infamous since brother nikolay have become what he be   you know what he do   oh it ’ awful awful  repeat levin after obtain his brother ’s address from sergey ivanovitch ’s footman levin be on the point of set off at once to see he but on second thought he decide to put off his visit till the evening the first thing to do to set his heart at rest be to accomplish what he have come to moscow for from his brother ’s levin go to oblonsky ’s office and on get news of the shtcherbatskys from he he drive to the place where he have be tell he might find kitty at four o’clock conscious of his throb heart levin step out of a hire sledge at the zoological garden and turn along the path to the frozen mound and the skating ground know that he would certainly find she there as he have see the shtcherbatskys  carriage at the entrance it be a bright frosty day row of carriage sledge driver and policeman be stand in the approach crowd of welldressed people with hat bright in the sun swarm about the entrance and along the wellswept little path between the little house adorn with carving in the russian style the old curly birch of the garden all their twig laden with snow look as though freshly deck in sacred vestment he walk along the path towards the skatingground and keep say to himself—“you must not be excited you must be calm what ’ the matter with you what do you want be quiet stupid  he conjure his heart and the more he try to compose himself the more breathless he find himself an acquaintance meet he and call he by his name but levin do not even recognize he he go towards the mound whence come the clank of the chain of sledge as they slip down or be drag up the rumble of the slide sledge and the sound of merry voice he walk on a few step and the skatingground lie open before his eye and at once amidst all the skater he know she he know she be there by the rapture and the terror that seize on his heart she be stand talk to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there be apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she be as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettle everything be make bright by she she be the smile that shed light on all round she  be it possible i can go over there on the ice go up to she  he think the place where she stand seem to he a holy shrine unapproachable and there be one moment when he be almost retreat so overwhelmed be he with terror he have to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sort be move about she and that he too might come there to skate he walk down for a long while avoid look at she as at the sun but see she as one do the sun without look on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquaint with one another use to meet on the ice there be crack skater there show off their skill and learner cling to chair with timid awkward movement boy and elderly people skate with hygienic motive they seem to levin an elect band of blissful being because they be here near she all the skater it seem with perfect selfpossession skate towards she skate by she even speak to she and be happy quite apart from she enjoy the capital ice and the fine weather nikolay shtcherbatsky kitty ’s cousin in a short jacket and tight trouser be sit on a garden seat with his skate on see levin he shout to he  ah the first skater in russia be here long firstrate ice — do put your skate on   i have not get my skate  levin answer marvel at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second lose sight of she though he do not look at she he feel as though the sun be come near he she be in a corner and turn out her slender foot in their high boot with obvious timidity she skate towards he a boy in russian dress desperately wave his arm and bow down to the ground overtake she she skate a little uncertainly take her hand out of the little muff that hang on a cord she hold they ready for emergency and look towards levin whom she have recognize she smile at he and at her own fear when she have get round the turn she give herself a push off with one foot and skate straight up to shtcherbatsky clutch at his arm she nod smile to levin she be more splendid than he have imagine she when he think of she he could call up a vivid picture of she to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulder and so full of childish brightness and good humor the childishness of her expression together with the delicate beauty of her figure make up her special charm and that he fully realize but what always strike he in she as something unlooke for be the expression of her eye soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transport levin to an enchanted world where he feel himself softened and tender as he remember himself in some day of his early childhood  have you be here long  she say give he her hand  thank you  she add as he pick up the handkerchief that have fall out of her muff  i i ’ve not long   yesterday   i mean today   i arrive  answer levin in his emotion not at once understand her question  i be mean to come and see you  he say and then recollect with what intention he be try to see she he be promptly overcome with confusion and blush  i do not know you could skate and skate so well  she look at he earnestly as though wish to make out the cause of his confusion  your praise be worth have the tradition be keep up here that you be the good of skater  she say with her little blackgloved hand brush a grain of hoarfrost off her muff  yes i use once to skate with passion i want to reach perfection   you do everything with passion i think  she say smile  i should so like to see how you skate put on skate and let we skate together   skate together can that be possible  think

 except you there ’ none of the gentleman firstrate skater will that be all right  say he tighten the strap  oh yes yes make haste please  answer levin with difficulty restrain the smile of rapture which would overspread his face  yes  he think  this now be life this be happiness together she say let we skate together speak to she now but that ’ just why i ’m afraid to speak — because i ’m happy now happy in hope anyway and then but i must i must i must away with weakness  levin rise to his foot take off his overcoat and scurry over the rough ice round the hut come out on the smooth ice and skate without effort as it be by simple exercise of will increase and slacken speed and turn his course he approach with timidity but again her smile reassure he she give he her hand and they set off side by side go fast and fast and the more rapidly they move the more tightly she grasp his hand  with you i should soon learn i somehow feel confidence in you  she say to he  and i have confidence in myself when you be lean on i  he say but be at once panicstricken at what he have say and blush and indeed no soon have he utter these word when all at once like the sun go behind a cloud her face

peculiarity she question he about his life  surely you must be dull in the country in the winter be not you  she say  no i ’m not dull i be very busy  he say feel that she be hold he in check by her

table  you must understand  say he  it ’ not love i ’ve be in love but it ’ not that it ’ not my feeling but a sort of force outside i have take possession of i i go away you see because i make up my mind that it could never be you understand as a happiness that do not come on earth but i ’ve struggle with myself i see there ’ no living without it and it must be settle   what do you go away for   ah stop a minute ah the thought that come crowd on one the question one must ask oneself listen you can not imagine what you ’ve do for i by what you say i ’m so happy that i ’ve become positively hateful i ’ve forget everything i hear today that my brother nikolay   you know he ’ here   i have even forget he it seem to i that he ’ happy too it ’ a sort of madness but one thing ’ awful here you ’ve be marry you know the feeling   it ’ awful that we — old — with a past   not of love but of sin   be bring all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent it ’ loathsome and that ’ why one can not help feel oneself unworthy   oh well you ’ve not many sin on your conscience   alas all the same  say levin  when with loathing i go over my life i shudder and curse and bitterly regret it yes   what would you have the world ’ make so  say stepan arkadyevitch  the one comfort be like that prayer which i always like  forgive i not accord to my unworthiness but accord to thy lovingkindness  that ’ the only way she can forgive i  levin empty his glass and they be silent for a while  there ’ one other thing i ought to tell you do you know vronsky  stepan arkadyevitch ask levin  no i do not why do you ask   give we another bottle  stepan arkadyevitch direct the tatar who be fill up their glass and fidget round they just when he be not want  why you ought to know vronsky be that he ’ one of your rival   who ’ vronsky  say levin and his face be suddenly transform from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky have just be admire to an angry and unpleasant expression  vronsky be one of the son of count kirill ivanovitch vronsky and one of the fine specimen of the gilded youth of petersburg i make his acquaintance in tver when i be there on official business and he come there for the levy of recruit fearfully rich handsome great connection an aidedecamp and with all that a very nice goodnatured fellow but he ’ more than simply a goodnatured fellow as i ’ve find out here — he ’ a cultivated man too and very intelligent he ’ a man who ’ll make his mark  levin scowl and be dumb  well he turn up here soon after you ’d go and as i can see he ’ over head and ear in love with kitty and you know that her mother   excuse i but i know nothing  say levin frown gloomily and immediately he recollect his brother nikolay and how hateful he be to have be able to forget he  you wait a bit wait a bit  say stepan arkadyevitch smile and touch his hand  i ’ve tell you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chance be in your favor  levin drop back in his chair his face be pale  but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be  pursue oblonsky fill up his glass  no thank i can not drink any more  say levin push away his glass  i shall be drunk come tell i how be you get on  he go on obviously anxious to change the conversation  one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i do not advise you to speak  say stepan arkadyevitch  go round tomorrow morning make an offer in due form and god bless you   oh do you still think of come to i for some shooting come next spring do  say levin now his whole soul be full of remorse that he have begin this conversation with stepan arkadyevitch a feeling such as his be profane by talk of the rivalry of some petersburg officer of the supposition and the counsel of stepan arkadyevitch stepan arkadyevitch smile he know what be pass in levin ’s soul  i ’ll come some day  he say  but woman my boy they ’re the pivot everything turn upon thing be in a bad way with i very bad and it ’ all through woman tell i frankly now  he pursue pick up a cigar and keep one hand on his glass  give i your advice   why what be it   i ’ll tell you suppose you ’re married you love your wife but you ’re fascinate by another woman   excuse i but i ’m absolutely unable to comprehend how   just as i can not comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a baker ’s shop and steal a roll  stepan arkadyevitch ’s eye sparkle more than usual  why not a roll will sometimes smell so good one can not resist it   himmlisch ist ’s wenn ich bezwungen meine irdische begier aber doch wenn ’ nich gelungen hatt  ich auch recht hübsch plaisir  as he say this stepan arkadyevitch smile subtly levin too could not help smile  yes but joke apart  resume stepan arkadyevitch  you must understand that the woman be a sweet gentle love creature poor and lonely and have sacrifice everything now when the thing ’ do do not you see can one possibly cast she off even suppose one part from she so as not to break up one ’s family life still can one help feel for she set she on her foot soften her lot   well you must excuse i there you know to i all woman be divide into two class   at least no   true to say there be woman and there be   i ’ve never see exquisite fall being and i never shall see they but such creature as that paint frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlet be vermin to my mind and all fall woman be the same   but the magdalen   ah drop that christ would never have say those word if he have know how they would be abuse of all the gospel those word be the only one remember however i ’m not say so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fall woman you ’re afraid of spider and i of these vermin most likely you ’ve not make a study of spider and do not know their character and so it be with i   it ’ very well for you to talk like that it ’ very much like that gentleman in dickens who use to fling all difficult question over his right shoulder but to deny the fact be no answer what ’ to be do — you tell i that what ’ to be do your wife get old while you ’re full of life before you ’ve time to look round you feel that you can not love your wife with love however much you may esteem she and then all at once love turn up and you ’re do for do for  stepan arkadyevitch say with weary despair levin half smile  yes you ’re do for  resume oblonsky  but what ’ to be do   do not steal roll  stepan arkadyevitch laugh outright  oh moralist but you must understand there be two woman one insist only on her right and those right be your love which you can not give she and the other sacrifice everything for you and ask for nothing what be you to do how be you to act there ’ a fearful tragedy in it   if you care for my profession of faith as regard that i ’ll tell you that i do not believe there be any tragedy about it and this be why to my mind love   both the sort of love which you remember plato define in his banquet serve as the test of man some man only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love have no need to talk of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy  i ’m much obliged for the gratification my humble respects’—that ’ all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all be clear and pure because  at that instant levin recollect his own sin and the inner conflict he have live through and he add unexpectedly  but perhaps you be right very likely   i do not know i do not know   it ’ this do not you see  say stepan arkadyevitch  you ’re very much all of a piece that ’ your strong point and your failing you have a character that ’ all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too — but that ’ not how it be you despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably correspond all the while with the aim — and that ’ not how it be you want a man ’s work too always to have a define aim and love and family life always to be undivided — and that ’ not how it be all the you all the charm all the beauty of life be make up of light and shadow  levin sigh and make no reply he be think of his own affair and do not hear oblonsky and suddenly both of they feel that though they be friend though they have be dine and drink together which should have draw they close yet each be think only of his own affair and they have nothing to do with one another oblonsky have more than once experience this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy come on after dinner and he know what to do in such case  bill  he call and he go into the next room where he promptly come across an aidedecamp of his acquaintance and drop into conversation with he about an actress and her protector and at once in the conversation with the aidedecamp oblonsky have a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with levin which always put he to too great a mental and spiritual strain when the tatar appear with a bill for twentysix rouble and odd kopeck besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have be horrify like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen rouble do not notice it pay and set off homewards to dress and go to the shtcherbatskys  there to decide his fate the young princess kitty shtcherbatskaya be eighteen it be the first winter that she have be out in the world her success in society have be great than that of either of her eld sister and great even than her mother have anticipate to say nothing of the young man who dance at the moscow ball be almost all in love with kitty two serious suitor have already this first winter make their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky levin ’s appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visit and evident love for kitty have lead to the first serious conversation between kitty ’s parent as to her future and to dispute between they the prince be on levin ’s side he say he wish for nothing well for kitty the princess for her part go round the question in the manner peculiar to woman maintain that kitty be too young that levin have do nothing to prove that he have serious intention that kitty feel no great attraction to he and other side issue but she do not state the principal point which be that she look for a well match for her daughter and that levin be not to her liking and she do not understand he when levin have abruptly depart the princess be delighted and say to her husband triumphantly  you see i be right  when vronsky appear on the scene she be still more delighted confirm in her opinion that kitty be to make not simply a good but a brilliant match in the mother ’s eye there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin she dislike in levin his strange and uncompromising opinion and his shyness in society found as she suppose on his pride and his queer sort of life as she consider it absorb in cattle and peasant she do not very much like it that he who be in love with her daughter have keep come to the house for six week as though he be wait for something inspect as though he be afraid he might be do they too great an honor by make an offer and do not realize that a man who continually visit at a house where there be a young unmarried girl be bind to make his intention clear and suddenly without do so he disappear  it ’ as well he ’ not attractive enough for kitty to have fall in love with he  think the mother vronsky satisfy all the mother ’s desire very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing well could be wish for vronsky openly flirt with kitty at ball dance with she and come continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intention but in spite of that the mother have spend the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation princess shtcherbatskaya have herself be marry thirty year ago her aunt arrange the match her husband about whom everything be well know beforehand have come look at his future bride and be look at the matchmaking aunt have ascertain and communicate their mutual impression that impression have be favorable afterwards on a day fix beforehand the expect offer be make to her parent and accept all have pass very simply and easily so it seem at least to the princess but over her own daughter she have feel how far from simple and easy be the business apparently so commonplace of marry off one ’s daughter the panic that have be live through the thought that have be brood over the money that have be waste and the dispute with her husband over marry the two eld girl darya and natalia now since the young have come out she be go through the same terror the same doubt and still more violent quarrel with her husband than she have over the eld girl the old prince like all father indeed be exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughter he be irrationally jealous over his daughter especially over kitty who be his favorite at every turn he have scene with the princess for compromise her daughter the princess have grow accustomed to this already with her other daughter but now she feel that there be more ground for the prince ’s touchiness she see that of late year much be change in the manner of society that a mother ’s duty have become still more difficult she see that girl of kitty ’s age form some sort of club go to some sort of lecture mix freely in man ’s society drive about the street alone many of they do not curtsey and what be the most important thing all the girl be firmly convince that to choose their husband be their own affair and not their parent   marriage be not make nowadays as they use to be  be think and say you all these young girl and even by their elder but how marriage be make now the princess could not learn from anyone the french fashion — of the parent arrange their child ’s future — be not accept it be condemn the english fashion of the complete independence of girl be also not accept and not possible in russian society the russian fashion of matchmaking by the office of intermediate person be for some reason consider unseemly it be ridicule by everyone and by the princess herself but how girl be to be marry and how parent be to marry they no one know everyone with whom the princess have chance to discuss the matter say the same thing  mercy on we it ’ high time in our day to cast off all that oldfashioned business it ’ the young people have to marry and not their parent and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose  it be very easy for anyone to say that who have no daughter but the princess realize that in the process of get to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall in love with someone who do not care to marry she or who be quite unfit to be her husband and however much it be instill into the princess that in our time young people ought to arrange their life for themselves she be unable to believe it just as she would have be unable to believe that at any time whatever the most suitable plaything for child five year old ought to be load pistol and so the princess be more uneasy over kitty than she have be over her eld sister now she be afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirt with her daughter she see that her daughter be in love with he but try to comfort herself with the thought that he be an honorable man and would not do this but at the same time she know how easy it be with the freedom of manner of today to turn a girl ’s head and how lightly man generally regard such a crime the week before kitty have tell her mother of a conversation she have with vronsky during a mazurka this conversation have partly reassure the princess but perfectly at ease she could not be vronsky have tell kitty that both he and his brother be so used to obey their mother that they never make up their mind to any important undertaking without consult she  and just now i be impatiently await my mother ’s arrival from petersburg as peculiarly fortunate  he tell she kitty have repeat this without attach any significance to the word but her mother see they in a different light she know that the old lady be expect from day to day that she would be pleased at her son ’s choice and she feel it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vex his mother however she be so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fear that she believe it be so bitter as it be for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eld daughter dolly on the point of leave her husband her anxiety over the decision of her young daughter ’s fate engross all her feeling today with levin ’s reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arise she be afraid that her daughter who have at one time as she fancy a feeling for levin might from extreme sense of honor refuse vronsky and that levin ’s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near be conclude  why have he be here long  the princess ask about levin as they return home  he come today mamma   there ’ one thing i want to say  begin the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guess what it would be  mamma  she say flush hotly and turn quickly to she  please please do not say anything about that i know i know all about it  she wish for what her mother wish for but the motive of her mother ’s wish wound she  i only want to say that to raise hope   mamma darling for goodness  sake do not talk about it it ’ so horrible to talk about it   i will not  say her mother see the tear in her daughter ’s eye  but one thing my love you promise i you would have no secret from i you will n’t   never mamma none  answer kitty flush a little and look her mother straight in the face  but there ’ no use in my tell you anything and i   i   if i want to i do not know what to say or how i do not know   no she could not tell an untruth with those eye  think the mother smile at her agitation and happiness the princess smile that what be take place just now in her soul seem to the poor child so immense and so important after dinner and till the beginning of the evening kitty be feel a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle her heart throb violently and her thought would not rest on anything she feel that this evening when they would both meet for the first time would be a turn point in her life and she be continually picture they to herself at one moment each separately and then both together when she muse on the past she dwell with pleasure with tenderness on the memory of her relation with levin the memory of childhood and of levin ’s friendship with her dead brother give a special poetic charm to her relation with he his love for she of which she feel certain be flattering and delightful to she and it be pleasant for she to think of levin in her memory of vronsky there always enter a certain element of awkwardness though he be in the high degree wellbred and at ease as though there be some false note — not in vronsky he be very simple and nice but in herself while with levin she feel perfectly simple and clear but on the other hand directly she think of the future with vronsky there arise before she a perspective of brilliant happiness with levin the future seem misty when she go upstairs to dress and look into the lookingglass she notice with joy that it be one of her good day and that she be in complete possession of all her force — she need this so for what lie before she she be conscious of external composure and free grace in her movement at halfpast seven she have only just go down into the drawingroom when the footman announce  konstantin dmitrievitch levin  the princess be still in her room and the prince have not come in  so it be to be  think kitty and all the blood seem to rush to her heart she be horrified at her paleness as she glance into the lookingglass at

because i ’m a fool or be condescending to i i like that so to see he condescending i be so glad he can not bear i  she use to say of he she be right for levin actually could not bear she and despise she for what she be proud of and regard as a fine characteristic — her nervousness her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly the countess nordston and levin get into that relation with one another not seldom see in society when two person who remain externally on friendly term despise each other to such a degree that they can not even take each other seriously and can not even be offend by each other the countess nordston pounce upon levin at once  ah konstantin dmitrievitch so you ’ve come back to our corrupt babylon  she say give he her tiny yellow hand and

that must be vronsky  think levin and to be sure of it glance at kitty she have already have time to look at vronsky and look round at levin and simply from the look in her eye that grow unconsciously bright levin know that she love that man know it as surely as if she have tell he so in word but what sort of a man be he now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man be like whom she love there be people who on meet a successful rival no matter in what be at once disposed to turn their back on everything good in he and to see only what be bad there be people on the other hand who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the quality by which he have outstrip they and seek with a throb ache at heart only what be good levin belong to the second class but he have no difficulty in find what be good and attractive in vronsky it be apparent at the first glance vronsky be a squarely build dark man not very tall with a goodhumored handsome and exceedingly calm and resolute face everything about his face and figure from his shortcropped black hair and freshly shave chin down to his loosely fitting brandnew uniform be simple and at the same time elegant make way for the lady who have come in vronsky go up to the princess and then to kitty as he approach she his beautiful eye shine with a specially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seem to levin bow carefully and respectfully over she he hold out his small broad hand to she greet and say a few word to everyone he sit down without once glance

and hate town and we townspeople  say countess nordston  my word must make a deep impression on you since you remember they so well  say levin and suddenly conscious that he have say just the same thing before he redden vronsky look at levin and countess nordston and smile  be you always in the country  he inquire  i should think it must be dull in the winter   it ’ not dull if one have work to do besides one ’ not dull by oneself  levin reply abruptly  i be fond of the country  say vronsky notice and affect not to notice levin ’s tone  but i hope count you would not consent to live in the country always  say countess nordston  i do not know i have never try for long i experience a queer feeling once  he go on  i never long so for the country russian country with bast shoe and peasant as when i be spend a winter with my mother in nice nice itself be dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento be only pleasant for a short time and it ’ just there that russia come back to i most vividly and especially the country it ’ as though  he talk on address both kitty and levin turn his serene friendly eye from one to the other and say obviously just what come into his head notice that countess nordston want to say something he stop short without finish what he have begin and listen attentively to she the conversation do not flag for an instant so that the princess who always keep in reserve in case a subject should be lack two heavy gun — the relative advantage of classical and of modern education and universal military service — have not to move out either of they while countess nordston have not a chance of chaff levin levin want to and could not take part in the general conversation say to himself every instant  now go  he still do not go as though wait for something the conversation fall upon tableturning and spirit and countess nordston who believe in spiritualism begin to describe the marvel she have see  ah countess you really must take i for pity ’s sake do take i to see they i have never see anything extraordinary though i be always on the lookout for it everywhere  say vronsky smile  very well next saturday  answer countess nordston  but you konstantin dmitrievitch do you believe in it  she ask levin  why do you ask i you know what i shall say   but i want to hear your opinion   my opinion  answer levin  be only that this tableturning simply prove that educate society — so call — be no high than the peasant they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and omen while we   oh then you do not believe in it   i can not believe in it countess   but if i ’ve see it myself   the peasant woman too tell we they have see goblin   then you think i tell a lie  and she laugh a mirthless laugh  oh no masha konstantin dmitrievitch say he could not believe in it  say kitty blush for levin and levin see this and still more exasperated would have answer but vronsky with his bright frank smile rush to the support of the conversation which be threaten to become disagreeable  you do not admit the conceivability at all  he query  but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to we which   when electricity be discover  levin interrupt hurriedly  it be only the phenomenon that be discover and it be unknown from what it proceed and what be its effect and age pass before its application be conceive but the spiritualist have begin with table write for they and spirit appear to they and have only later start say that it be an unknown force  vronsky listen attentively to levin as he always do listen obviously interested in his word  yes but the spiritualist say we do not know at present what this force be but there be a force and these be the condition in which it act let the scientific man find out what the force consist in no i do not see why there should not be a new force if it   why because with electricity  levin interrupt again  every time you rub tar against wool a recognize phenomenon be manifest but in this case it do not happen every time and so it follow it be not a natural phenomenon  feeling probably that the conversation be take a tone too serious for a drawingroom vronsky make no rejoinder but by way of try to change the conversation he smile brightly and turn to the lady  do let we try at once countess  he say but levin would finish say what he think  i think  he go on  that this attempt of the spiritualist to explain their marvel as some sort of new natural force be most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment  everyone be wait for he to finish and he feel it  and i think you would be a firstrate medium  say countess nordston  there ’ something enthusiastic in you  levin open his mouth be about to say something redden and say nothing  do let we try tableturning at once please  say vronsky  princess will you allow it  and vronsky stand up look for a little table kitty get up to fetch a table and as she pass her eye meet levin ’s she feel for he with her whole heart the more because she be pity he for suffering of which she be herself the cause  if you can forgive i forgive i  say her eye  i be so happy   i hate they all and you and myself  his eye respond and he take up his hat but he be not destine to escape just as they

thought that she have receive an offer she have no doubt that she have act rightly but after she have go to bed for a long while she could not sleep one impression pursue she relentlessly it be levin

after her conversation with her daughter have go to the prince to say goodnight as usual and though she have no intention of tell he of levin ’s offer and kitty ’s refusal still she hint to her husband that she fancy thing be practically settle with vronsky and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrive and thereupon at those word the prince have all at once fly into a passion and begin to use unseemly language  what have you do i ’ll tell you what first of all you ’re try to catch an eligible gentleman and all moscow will be talk of it and with good reason if you have evening party invite everyone do not pick out the possible suitor invite all the young buck engage a piano player and let they dance and not as you do thing nowadays hunt up good match it make i sick sick to see it and you ’ve go on till you ’ve turn the poor wench ’s head levin ’ a thousand time the well man as for this little petersburg swell they ’re turn out by you all on one pattern and all precious rubbish but if he be a prince of the blood my daughter need not run after anyone   but what have i do   why you ’ve  the prince be cry wrathfully  i know if one be to listen to you  interrupt the princess  we should never marry our daughter if it ’ to be so we ’d well go into the country   well and we have well   but do wait a minute do i try and catch they i do not try to catch they in the least a young man and a very nice one have fall in love with she and she i fancy   oh yes you fancy and how if she really be in love and he ’ no more think of marriage than i be oh that i should live to see it ah spiritualism ah nice ah the ball  and the prince imagine that he be mimic his wife make a mincing curtsey at each word  and this be how we ’re prepare wretchedness for kitty and she ’ really get the notion into her head   but what make you suppose so   i do not suppose i know we have eye for such thing though womenfolk have not i see a man who have serious intention that ’ levin and i see a peacock like this featherhead who ’ only amuse himself   oh well when once you get an idea into your head   well you ’ll remember my word but too late just as with dolly   well well we will not talk of it  the princess stop he recollect her unlucky dolly  you all mean and goodnight  and sign each other with the cross the husband and wife part with a kiss feel that they each remain of their own opinion the princess have at first be quite certain that that evening have settle kitty ’s future and that there could be no doubt of vronsky ’s intention but her husband ’s word have disturb she and return to her own room in terror before the unknown future she too like kitty repeat several time in her heart  lord have pity lord have pity lord have pity  vronsky have never have a real home life his mother have be in her youth a brilliant society woman who have have during her married life and still more afterwards many love affair notorious in the whole fashionable world his father he scarcely remember and he have be educate in the corps of pages leave the school very young as a brilliant officer he have at once get into the circle of wealthy petersburg army man although he do go more or less into petersburg society his love affair have always hitherto be outside it in moscow he have for the first time feel after his luxurious and coarse life at petersburg all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank who care for he it never even enter his head that there could be any harm in his relation with kitty at ball he dance principally with she he be a constant visitor at their house he talk to she as people commonly do talk in society — all sort of nonsense but nonsense to which he could not help attach a special meaning in her case although he say nothing to she that he could not have say before everybody he feel that she be become more and more dependent upon he and the more he feel this the well he like it and the tenderer be his feeling for she he do not know that his mode of behavior in relation to kitty have a definite character that it be court young girl with no intention of marriage and that such courting be one of the evil action common among brilliant young man such as he be it seem to he that he be the first who have discover this pleasure and he be enjoy his discovery if he could have hear what her parent be say that evening if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have hear that kitty would be unhappy if he do not marry she he would have be greatly astonished and would not have believe it he could not believe that what give such great and delicate pleasure to he and above all to she could be wrong still less could he have believe that he ought to marry marriage have never present itself to he as a possibility he not only dislike family life but a family and especially a husband be in accordance with the view general in the bachelor world in which he live conceive as something alien repellant and above all ridiculous but though vronsky have not the least suspicion what the parent be say he feel on come away from the shtcherbatskys  that the secret spiritual bond which exist between he and kitty have grow so much strong that evening that some step must be take but what step could and ought to be take he could not imagine  what be so exquisite  he think as he return from the shtcherbatskys  carry away with he as he always do a delicious feeling of purity and freshness arise partly from the fact that he have not be smoke for a whole evening and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him—“what be so exquisite be that not a word have be say by i or by she but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of look and tone that this evening more clearly than ever she tell i she love i and how secretly simply and most of all how trustfully i feel myself well pure i feel that i have a heart and that there be a great deal of good in i those sweet love eye when she say  indeed i do   well what then oh nothing it ’ good for i and good for she  and he begin wonder where to finish the evening he pass in review of the place he might go to  club a game of bezique champagne with ignatov no i ’m not go château des fleurs there i shall find oblonsky song the cancan no i ’m sick of it that ’ why i like the shtcherbatskys  that i ’m grow well i ’ll go home  he go straight to his room at dussots  hotel order supper and then undress and as soon as his head touch the pillow fall into a sound sleep next day at eleven o’clock in the morning vronsky drive to the station of the petersburg railway to meet his mother and the first person he come across on the great flight of step be oblonsky who be expect his sister by the same train  ah your excellency  cry oblonsky  whom be you meet   my mother  vronsky respond smile as everyone do who meet oblonsky he shake hand with he and together they ascend the step

laugh goodhumoredly  will the train soon be in  vronsky ask a railway official  the train ’ signal  answer the man the approach of the train be more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station the rush of porter the movement of policeman and attendant and people meet the train through the frosty vapor could be see workman in short sheepskin and soft felt boot cross the rail of the curve line the hiss of the boiler could be hear on the distant rail and the rumble of something heavy  no  say stepan arkadyevitch who feel a great inclination to tell vronsky of levin ’s intention in regard to kitty  no you ’ve not get a true impression of levin he ’ a very nervous man and be sometimes out of humor it ’ true but then he be often very nice he ’ such a true honest nature and a heart of gold but yesterday there be special reason  pursue stepan arkadyevitch with a meaning smile totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he have feel the day before for his friend and feel the same sympathy now only for vronsky  yes there be reason why he could not help be either particularly happy or particularly unhappy  vronsky stand still and ask directly  how so do you mean he make your bellesœur an offer yesterday   maybe  say stepan arkadyevitch  i fancy something of the sort yesterday yes if he go away early and be out of humor too it must mean it he ’ be so long in love and i ’m very sorry for he   so that ’ it i should imagine though she might reckon on a well match  say vronsky draw himself up and walk about again  though i do not know he of course  he add  yes that be a hateful position that ’ why most fellow prefer to have to do with klaras if you do not succeed with they it only prove that you ’ve not enough cash but in this case one ’s dignity ’ at stake but here

great staircase flood with light and line with flower and footman in powder and red coat from the room come a constant steady hum as from a hive and the rustle of movement and while on the landing between tree they give last touch to their hair and dress before the mirror they hear from the ballroom the careful distinct note of the fiddle of the orchestra begin the first waltz a little old man in civilian dress arrange his gray curl before another mirror and diffuse an odor of scent stumble against they on the stair and stand aside evidently admire kitty whom he do not know a beardless youth one of those society youth whom the old prince shtcherbatsky call  young buck  in an exceedingly open waistcoat straighten his white tie as he go bow to they and after run by come back to ask kitty for a quadrille as the first quadrille have already be give to vronsky she have to promise this youth the second an officer button his glove stand aside in the doorway and stroke his mustache admire rosy kitty although her dress her coiffure and all the preparation for the ball have cost kitty great trouble and consideration at this moment she walk into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosette and lace all the minute detail of her attire have not cost she or her family a moment ’s attention as though she have be bear in that tulle and lace with her hair do up high on her head and a rose and two leave on the top of it when just before enter the ballroom the princess her mother try to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash kitty have draw back a little she feel that everything must be right of itself and graceful and nothing could need set straight it be one of kitty ’s good day her dress be not

nestle with special softness round her neck that velvet be delicious at home look at her neck in the lookingglass kitty have feel that that velvet be speak about all the rest there might be a doubt but the velvet be delicious kitty smile here too at the ball when she glance at it in the glass her bare shoulder and arm give kitty a sense of chill marble a feeling she particularly like her eye sparkle and her rosy lip could not keep from smile from the consciousness of her own attractiveness she have scarcely enter the ballroom and reach the throng of lady all tulle ribbon lace and flower wait to be ask to dance — kitty be never one of that throng — when she be ask for a waltz and ask by the good partner the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom a renowned director of dance a married man handsome and wellbuilt yegorushka korsunsky he have only just leave the countess bonina with whom he have dance the first half of the waltz and scan his kingdom — that be to say a few couple who have start dance — he catch sight of kitty enter and fly up to she with that peculiar easy amble which be confine to director of ball without even ask she if she care to dance he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist she look round for someone to give her fan to and their hostess smile to she take it  how nice you ’ve come in good time  he say to she embrace her waist  such a bad habit to be late  bend her left hand she lay it on his shoulder and her little foot in their pink slipper begin swiftly lightly and rhythmically move over the slippery floor in time to the music  it ’ a rest to waltz with you  he say to she as they fall into the first slow step of the waltz  it ’ exquisite — such lightness precision  he say to she the same thing he say to almost all his partner whom he know well she smile at his praise and continue to look about the room over his shoulder she be not like a girl at her first ball for whom all face in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland and she be not a girl who have go the stale round of ball till every face in the ballroom be familiar and tiresome but she be in the middle stage between these two she be excited and at the same time she have sufficient selfpossession to be able to observe in the left corner of the ballroom she see the cream of society gather together there — incredibly naked — be the beauty lidi korsunsky ’s wife there be the lady of the house there shine the bald head of krivin always to be find where the good people be in that direction gaze the young man not venture to approach there too

train float out in fan shape and cover krivin ’s knee korsunsky bow set straight his open shirt front and give she his arm to conduct she to anna arkadyevna kitty flush take her train from krivin ’s knee and a little giddy look round seek anna anna be not in lilac as kitty have so urgently wish but in a black lowcut velvet gown show her full throat and shoulder that look as though carve in old ivory and her rounded arm with tiny slender wrist the whole gown be trim with venetian guipure on her head among her black hair — her own with no false addition — be a little wreath of pansy and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace her coiffure be not strike all that be noticeable be the little wilful tendril of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temple round her wellcut strong neck be a thread of pearl kitty have be see anna every day she adore she and have picture she invariably in lilac but now see she in black she feel that she have not fully see her charm she see she now as someone quite new and surprising to she now she understand that anna could not have be in lilac and that her charm be just that she always stand out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on she and her black dress with its sumptuous lace be not noticeable on she it be only the frame and all that be see be she — simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and eager she be stand hold herself as always very erect and when kitty draw near the group she be speak to the master of the house her head slightly turn towards he

glance wonderingly at he he flush slightly and hurriedly ask she to waltz but he have only just put his arm round her waist and take the first step when the music suddenly stop kitty look into his face which be so close to her own and long afterwards — for several year after — that look full of love to which he make no response cut she to the heart with an agony of shame  pardon pardon waltz waltz  shout korsunsky from the other side of the room and seize the first young lady he come across he begin dance himself vronsky and kitty waltz several time round the room after the first waltz kitty go to her mother and she have hardly time to say a few word to countess nordston when vronsky come up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance be say there be disjointed talk between they of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he describe very amusingly as delightful child at forty and of the future town theater and only once the conversation touch she to the quick when he ask she about levin whether he be here and add that he like he so much but kitty do not expect much from the quadrille she look forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka she fancy that in the mazurka everything must be decide the fact that he do not during the quadrille ask she for the mazurka do not trouble she she feel sure she would dance the mazurka with he as she have do at former ball and refuse five young man say she be engaged for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last quadrille be for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful color sound and motion she

anna she have not be near anna again since the beginning of the evening and now again she see she suddenly quite new and surprising she see in she the sign of that excitement of success she know so well in herself she see that she be intoxicate with the delighted admiration she be exciting she know that feeling and know its sign and see they in anna see the quiver flash light in her eye and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously play on her lip and the deliberate grace precision and lightness of her movement  who  she ask herself  all or one  and not assist the harassed young man she be dance with in the conversation the thread of which he have lose and could not pick up again she obey with external liveliness the peremptory shout of korsunsky start they all into the grand rond and then into the chaîne and at the same time she keep watch with a grow pang at her heart  no it ’ not the admiration of the crowd have intoxicate she but the adoration of one and that one can it be he  every time he speak to anna the joyous light flash into her eye and the smile of happiness curve her red lip she seem to make an effort to control herself to try not to show these sign of delight but they come out on her face of themselves  but what of he  kitty look at he and be fill with terror what be picture so clearly to kitty in the mirror of anna ’s face she see in he what have become of his always selfpossesse resolute manner and the carelessly serene expression of his face now every time he turn to she he bend his head as though he would have fall at her foot and in his eye there be nothing but humble submission and dread  i would not offend you  his eye seem every time to be say  but i want to save myself and i do not know how  on his face be a look such as kitty have never see before they be speak of common acquaintance keep up the most trivial conversation but to kitty it seem that every word they say be determine their fate and hers and strange it be that they be actually talk of how absurd ivan ivanovitch be with his french and how the eletsky girl might have make a well match yet these word have all the while consequence for they and they be feel just as kitty do the whole ball the whole world everything seem lose in fog in kitty ’s soul nothing but the stern discipline of her bringingup support she and force she to do what be expect of she that be to dance to answer question to talk even to smile but before the mazurka when they be begin to rearrange the chair and a few couple move out of the small room into the big room a moment of despair and horror come for kitty she have refuse five partner and now she be not dance the mazurka she have not even a hope of be ask for it because she be so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she have remain disengaged till now she would have to tell her mother she feel ill and go home but she have not the strength to do this she feel crushed she go to the furth end of the little drawingroom and sink into a low chair her light transparent skirt rise like a cloud about her slender waist one bare thin soft girlish arm hang listlessly be lose in the fold of her pink tunic in the other she hold her fan and with rapid short stroke fan her burn face but while she look like a butterfly cling to a blade of grass and just about to open its rainbow wing for fresh flight her heart ache with a horrible despair  but perhaps i be wrong perhaps it be not so  and again she recall all she have see  kitty what be it  say countess nordston step noiselessly over the carpet towards she  i do not understand it  kitty ’s low lip begin to quiver she get up quickly  kitty you ’re not dance the mazurka   no no  say kitty in a voice shake with tear  he ask she for

with whom she be to dance the mazurka and tell he to ask kitty kitty dance in the first couple and luckily for she she have not to talk because korsunsky be all the time run about direct the figure vronsky and anna sit almost opposite she she see they with her longsighted eye and see they too close by when they meet in the figure and the more she see of they the more convinced be she that her unhappiness be complete she see that they feel themselves alone in that crowded room and on vronsky ’s face always so firm and independent she see that look that have strike she of bewilderment and humble submissiveness like the expression of an intelligent dog when it have do wrong anna smile and her smile be reflect by he she grow thoughtful and he become serious some supernatural force draw kitty ’s eye to anna ’s face she be fascinating in her simple black dress fascinating be she round arm with their bracelet fascinating be her firm neck with its thread of pearl fascinating the stray curl of her loose hair fascinating the graceful light movement of her little foot and hand fascinating be that lovely face in its eagerness but there be something terrible and cruel in her fascination kitty admire she more than ever and more and more acute be her suffering kitty feel overwhelmed and her face show it when vronsky see she come across she in the mazurka he do not at once recognize she

stiff with she it frighten she no one ever speak to she so but the justice of the peace who try she for try to get out of a house of illfame mercy on we the senselessness in the world  he cry suddenly  these new institution these justice of the peace rural councils what hideousness it all be  and he begin to enlarge on his encounter with the new institution konstantin levin hear he and the disbelief in the sense of all public institution which he share with he and often express be distasteful to he now from his brother ’s lip  in another world we shall understand it all  he say lightly  in another world ah i do not like that other world i do not like it  he say let his scared eye rest on his brother ’s eye  here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess one ’s own and other people ’s would be a good thing and yet i ’m afraid of death awfully afraid of death  he shudder  but do drink something would you like some champagne or shall we go somewhere let ’s go to the gypsy do you know i have get so fond of the gypsy and russian song  his speech have begin to falter and he pass abruptly from one subject to another konstantin with the help of masha persuade he not to go out anywhere and get he to bed hopelessly drunk masha promise to write to konstantin in case of need and to persuade nikolay levin to go and stay with his brother in the morning konstantin levin leave moscow and towards evening he reach home on the journey in the train he talk to his neighbor about politic and the new railway and just as in moscow he be overcome by a sense of confusion of idea dissatisfaction with himself shame of something or other but when he get out at his own station when he see his oneeyed coachman ignat with the collar of his coat turn up when in the dim light reflect by the station fire he see his own sledge his own horse with their tail tie up in their harness trim with ring and tassel when the coachman ignat as he put in his luggage tell he the village news that the contractor have arrive and that pava have calve — he feel that little by little the confusion be clear up and the shame and selfdissatisfaction be pass away he feel this at the mere sight of ignat and the horse but when he have put on the sheepskin bring for he have sit down wrap up in the sledge and have drive off ponder on the work that lie before he in the village and stare at the sidehorse that have be his saddlehorse past his prime now but a spirited beast from the don he begin to see what have happen to he in quite a different light he feel himself and do not want to be anyone else all he want now be to be well than before in the first place he resolve that from that day he would give up hope for any extraordinary happiness such as marriage must have give he and consequently he would not so disdain what he really have secondly he would never again let himself give way to low passion the memory of which have so torture he when he have be make up his mind to make an offer then remember his brother nikolay he resolve to himself that he would never allow himself to forget he that he would follow he up and not lose sight of he so as to be ready to help when thing should go ill with he and that would be soon he feel then too his brother ’s talk of communism which he have treat so lightly at the time now make he think he consider a revolution in economic condition nonsense but he always feel the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasant and now he determine that so as to feel quite in the right though he have work hard and live by no mean luxuriously before he would now work still hard and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seem to he so easy a conquest over himself that he spend the whole drive in the pleasant daydream with a resolute feeling of hope in a new well life he reach home before nine o’clock at night the snow of the little quadrangle before the house be light up by a light in the bedroom window of his old nurse agafea mihalovna who perform the duty of housekeeper in his house she be not yet asleep kouzma wake up by she come sidle sleepily out onto the step a

detail come out the stag ’s horn the bookshelf the lookingglass the stove with its ventilator which have long want mend his father ’s sofa a large table on the table an open book a broken ashtray a manuscript book with his handwriting as he see all this there come over he for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arrange the new life of which he have be dream on the road all these trace of his life seem to clutch he and to say to he  no you ’re not go to get away from we and you ’re not go to be different but you ’re go to be the same as you ’ve always be with doubt everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself vain effort to amend and fall and everlasting expectation of a happiness which you will not get and which be not possible for you  this the thing say to he but another voice in his heart be tell he that he must not fall under the sway of the past and that one can do anything with oneself and hear that voice he go into the corner where stand his two heavy dumbbell and begin brandish they like a gymnast try to restore his confident temper there be a creak of step at the door he hastily put down the dumbbell the bailiff come in and say everything thank god be do well but inform he that the buckwheat in the new dry machine have be a little scorched this piece of news irritate levin the new dry machine have be construct and partly invent by levin the bailiff have always be against the drying machine and now it be with suppress triumph that he announce that the buckwheat have be scorch levin be firmly convince that if the buckwheat have be scorch it be only because the precaution have not be take for which he have hundred of time give order he be annoy and reprimand the bailiff but there have be an important and joyful event pava his good cow an expensive beast buy at a show have calve  kouzma give i my sheepskin and you tell they to take a lantern i ’ll come and look at she  he say to the bailiff the cowhouse for the more valuable cow be just behind the house walk across the yard pass a snowdrift by the lilac tree he go into the cowhouse there be the warm steamy smell of dung when the frozen door be open and the cow astonish at the unfamiliar light of the lantern stir on the fresh straw he catch a glimpse of the broad smooth black and piebald back of hollandka berkoot the bull be lie down with his ring in his lip and seem about to get up but think well of it and only give two snort as they pass by he pava a perfect beauty huge as a hippopotamus with her back turn to they prevent their see the calf as she sniff she all over levin go into the pen look pava over and lift the red and spotted calf onto her long totter leg pava uneasy begin low but when levin put the calf close to she she be soothe and sigh heavily begin lick she with her rough tongue the calf fumble poke her nose under her mother ’s udder and stiffen her tail out straight  here bring the light fyodor this way  say levin examine the calf  like the mother though the color take after the father but that ’ nothing very good long and broad in the haunch vassily fedorovitch be not she splendid  he say to the bailiff quite forgive he for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf  how could she fail to be oh semyon the contractor come the day after you leave you must settle with he konstantin dmitrievitch  say the bailiff  i do inform you about the machine  this question be enough to take levin back to all the detail of his work on the estate which be on a large scale and complicated he go straight from the cowhouse to the counting house and after a little conversation with the bailiff and semyon the contractor he go back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawingroom the house be big and oldfashioned and levin though he live alone have the whole house heat and use he know that this be stupid he know that it be positively not right and contrary to his present new plan but this house be a whole world to levin it be the world in which his father and mother have live and die they have live just the life that to levin seem the ideal of perfection and that he have dream of begin with his wife his family levin scarcely remember his mother his conception of she be for he a sacred memory and his future wife be bind to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite holy ideal of a woman that his mother have be he be so far from conceive of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively picture to himself first the family and only secondarily the woman who would give he a family his idea of marriage be consequently quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintance for whom get marry be one of the numerous fact of social life for levin it be the chief affair of life on which its whole

observation about the heating of the train anna answer a few word but not foresee any entertainment from the conversation she ask annushka to get a lamp hook it onto the arm of her seat and take from her bag a paperknife and an english novel at first her reading make no progress the fuss and bustle be disturbing then when the train have start she could not help listen to the noise then the snow beat on the left window and stick to the pane and the sight of the muffled guard pass by cover with snow on one side and the conversation about the terrible snowstorm rage outside distract her attention far on it be continually the same again and again the same shaking and rattle the same snow on the window the same rapid transition from steam heat to cold and back again to heat the same pass glimpse of the same figure in the twilight and the same voice and anna begin to read and to understand what she read annushka be already doze the red bag on her lap clutch by her broad hand in glove of which one be tear anna arkadyevna read and understand but it be distasteful to she to read that be to follow the reflection of other people ’s life she have too great a desire to live herself if she read that the heroine of the novel be nurse a sick man she long to move with noiseless step about the room of a sick man if she read of a member of parliament make a speech she long to be deliver the speech if she read of how lady mary have ride after the hound and have provoke her sisterinlaw and have surprise everyone by her boldness she too wish to be do the same but there be no

recollection all be good pleasant she remember the ball remember vronsky and his face of slavish adoration remember all her conduct with he there be nothing shameful and for all that at the same point in her memory the feeling of shame be intensify as though some inner voice just at the point when she think of vronsky be say to she  warm very warm hot   well what be it  she say to herself resolutely shift her seat in the lounge  what do it mean be i afraid to look it straight in the face why what be it can it be that between i and this officer boy there exist or can exist any other relation than such as be common with every acquaintance  she laugh contemptuously and take up her book again but now she be definitely unable to follow what she read she pass the paperknife over the window pane then lay its smooth cool surface to her cheek and almost laugh aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause come over she she feel as though her nerve be string be strain tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg she feel her eye open wider and wider her finger and toe twitch nervously something within oppress her breathing while all shape and sound seem in the uncertain halflight to strike she with unaccustomed vividness moment of doubt be continually come upon she when she be uncertain whether the train be go forwards or backwards or be stand still altogether whether it be annushka at her side or a stranger  what ’ that on the arm of the chair a fur cloak or some beast and what be i myself myself or some other woman  she be afraid of give way to this delirium but something draw she towards it and she could yield to it or resist it at will she get up to rouse herself and slip off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress for a moment she regain her selfpossession and realize that the thin peasant who have come in wear a long overcoat with button miss from it be the stoveheater that he be look at the thermometer that it be the wind and snow burst in after he at the door but then everything grow blurred again that peasant with the long waist seem to be gnaw something on the wall the old lady begin stretch her leg the whole length of the carriage and fill it with a black cloud then there be a fearful shrieking and banging as though someone be be tear to piece then there be a blind dazzle of red fire before her eye and a wall seem to rise up and hide everything anna feel as though she be sink down but it be not terrible but delightful the voice of a man muffle up and cover with snow shout something in her ear she get up and pull herself together she realize that they have reach a station and that this be the guard she ask annushka to hand she the cape she have take off and her shawl put they on and move towards the door  do you wish to get out  ask annushka  yes i want a little air it ’ very hot in here  and she open the door the drive snow and the wind rush to meet she and struggle with she over the door but she enjoy the struggle she open the door and go out the wind seem as though lie in wait for she with gleeful whistle it try to snatch she up and bear she off but she cling to the cold door post and hold her skirt get down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriage the wind have be powerful on the step but on the platform under the lee of the carriage there be a lull with enjoyment she draw deep breath of the frozen snowy air and stand near the carriage look about the platform and the lighted station the rage tempest rush whistle between the wheel of the carriage about the scaffolding and round the corner of the station the carriage post people everything that be to be see be cover with snow on one side and be get more and more thickly cover for a moment there would come a lull in the storm but then it would swoop down again with such onslaught that it seem impossible to stand against it meanwhile man run to and fro talk merrily together their step crackle on the platform as they continually open and close the big door the bent shadow of a man glide by at her foot and she hear sound of a hammer upon iron  hand over that telegram  come an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side  this way no 28  several different voice shout again and muffled figure run by cover with snow two gentleman with lighted cigarette pass by she she draw one more deep breath of the fresh air and have just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage when another man in a military overcoat quite close beside she step between she and the flicker light of the lamp post she look round and the same instant recognize vronsky ’s face put his hand to the peak of his cap he bow to she and ask be there anything she want could he be of any service to she she gaze rather a long while at he without answer and in spite of the shadow in which he be stand she see or fancy she see both the expression of his face and his eye it be again that expression of reverential ecstasy which have so work upon she the day before more than once she have tell herself during the past few day and again only a few moment before that vronsky be for she only one of the hundred of young man forever exactly the same that be meet everywhere that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon he but now at the first instant of meet he she be seize by a feeling of joyful pride she have no need to ask why he have come she know as certainly as if he have tell she that he be here to be where she be  i do not know you be go what be you come for  she say let fall the hand with which she have grasp the door post and irrepressible delight and eagerness shine in her face  what be i come for  he repeat look straight into her eye  you know that i have come to be where you be  he say  i can not help it  at that moment the wind as it be surmount all obstacle send the snow fly from the carriage roof and clank some sheet of iron it have tear off while the hoarse whistle of the engine roar in front plaintively and you all the awfulness of the storm seem to she more splendid now he have say what her soul long to hear though she fear it with her reason she make no answer and in her face he see conflict  forgive i if you dislike what i say  he say humbly he have speak courteously deferentially yet so firmly so stubbornly that for a long while she could make no answer  it ’ wrong what you say and i beg you if you ’re a good man to forget what you ’ve say as i forget it  she say at last  not one word not one gesture of yours shall i could i ever forget   enough enough  she cry try assiduously to give a stern expression to her face into which he be gaze greedily and clutch at the cold door post she clamber up the step and get rapidly into the corridor of the carriage but in the little corridor she pause go over in her imagination what have happen though she could not recall her own word or his she realize instinctively that the momentary conversation have bring they fearfully close and she be panicstricken and blissful at it after stand still a few second she go into the carriage and sit down in her place the overstrained condition which have torment she before do not only come back but be intensify and reach such a pitch that she be afraid every minute that something would snap within she from the excessive tension she do not sleep all night but in that nervous tension and in the vision that fill her imagination there be nothing disagreeable or gloomy on the contrary there be something blissful glow and exhilarating towards morning anna sink into a doze sit in her place and when she wake it be daylight and the train be near petersburg at once thought of home of husband and of son and the detail of that day and the following come upon she at petersburg as soon as the train stop and she get out the first person that attract her attention be her husband  oh mercy why do his ear look like

he different she be especially strike by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experience on meet he that feeling be an intimate familiar feeling like a consciousness of hypocrisy which she experience in her relation with her husband but hitherto she have not take note of the feeling now she be clearly and painfully aware of it  yes as you see your tender spouse as devoted as the first year after marriage burn with impatience to see you  he say in his deliberate highpitched voice and in that tone which he almost always take with she a tone of jeering at anyone who should say

straight before he or scan the people who get in and out if he have indeed on previous occasion strike and impress people who do not know he by his air of unhesitating composure he seem now more haughty and selfpossessed than ever he look at people as if they be thing a nervous young man a clerk in a law court sit opposite he hate he for that look the young man ask he for a light and enter into conversation with he and even push against he to make he feel that he be not a thing but a person but vronsky gaze at he exactly as he do at the lamp and the young man make a wry face feeling that he be lose his selfpossession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize he as a person vronsky see nothing and no one he feel himself a king not because he believe that he have make an impression on anna — he do not yet believe that — but because the impression she have make on he give he happiness and pride what would come of it all he do not know he do not even think he feel that all his force hitherto dissipate waste be center on one thing and bend with fearful energy on one blissful goal and he be happy at it he know only that he have tell she the truth that he have come where she be that all the happiness of his life the only meaning in life for he now lie in see and hear she and when he get out of the carriage at bologova to get some seltzer water and catch sight of

unconsciously  once more i shall see she walk her face she will say something turn her head glance smile maybe  but before he catch sight of she he see her husband whom the stationmaster be deferentially escort through the crowd  ah yes the husband  only now for the first time do vronsky realize clearly the fact that there be a person attach to she a husband he know that she have a husband but have hardly believe in his existence and only now fully believe in he with his head and shoulder and his leg clothe in black trouser especially when he see this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property see alexey alexandrovitch with his petersburg face and severely selfconfident figure in his round hat with his rather prominent spine he believe in he and be aware of a disagreeable sensation such as a man might feel torture by thirst who on reach a spring should find a dog a sheep or a pig who have drink of it and muddy the water alexey alexandrovitch ’s manner of walk with a swing of the hip and flat foot particularly annoy vronsky he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love she but she be still the same and the sight of she affect he
