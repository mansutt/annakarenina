 almost two month have pass the hot summer be half over but sergey ivanovitch be only just prepare to leave moscow sergey ivanovitch ’s life have not be uneventful during this time a year ago he have finish his book the fruit of six year  labor  sketch of a survey of the principle and form of government in europe and russia  several section of this book and its introduction have appear in periodical publication and other part have be read by sergey ivanovitch to person of his circle so that the lead idea of the work could not be completely novel to the public but still sergey ivanovitch have expect that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society and if it do not cause a revolution in social science it would at any rate make a great stir in the scientific world after the most conscientious revision the book have last year be publish and have be distribute among the bookseller though he ask no one about it reluctantly and with feigned indifference answer his friend  inquiry as to how the book be go and do not even inquire of the bookseller how the book be sell sergey ivanovitch be all on the alert with strained attention watch for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature but a week pass a second a third and in society no impression whatever could be detect his friend who be specialist and savant occasionally — unmistakably from politeness — allude to it the rest of his acquaintance not interested in a book on a learned subject do not talk of it at all and society generally — just now especially absorb in other thing — be absolutely indifferent in the press too for a whole month there be not a word about his book sergey ivanovitch have calculate to a nicety the time necessary for write a review but a month pass and a second and still there be silence only in the northern beetle in a comic article on the singer drabanti who have lose his voice there be a contemptuous allusion to koznishev ’s book suggest that the book have be long ago see through by everyone and be a subject of general ridicule at last in the third month a critical article appear in a serious review sergey ivanovitch know the author of the article he have meet he once at golubtsov ’s the author of the article be a young man an invalid very bold as a writer but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relation in spite of his absolute contempt for the author it be with complete respect that sergey ivanovitch set about read the article the article be awful the critic have undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it but he have select quotation so adroitly that for people who have not read the book and obviously scarcely anyone have read it it seem absolutely clear that the whole book be nothing but a medley of highflown phrase not even — as suggest by mark of interrogation — use appropriately and that the author of the book be a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject and all this be so wittily do that sergey ivanovitch would not have disown such wit himself but that be just what be so awful in spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which sergey ivanovitch verify the correctness of the critic ’s argument he do not for a minute stop to ponder over the fault and mistake which be ridicule but unconsciously he begin immediately try to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article  do not i offend he in some way  sergey ivanovitch wonder and remember that when they meet he have correct the young man about something he have say that betray ignorance sergey ivanovitch find the clue to explain the article this article be follow by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation and sergey ivanovitch see that his six year  task toil at with such love and labor have go leave no trace sergey ivanovitch ’s position be still more difficult from the fact that since he have finish his book he have have no more literary work to do such as have hitherto occupy the great part of his time sergey ivanovitch be clever cultivated healthy and energetic and he do not know what use to make of his energy conversation in drawingroom in meeting assembly and committee — everywhere where talk be possible — take up part of his time but be use for year to town life he do not waste all his energy in talk as his less experienced young brother do when he be in moscow he have a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of fortunately for he at this period so difficult for he from the failure of his book the various public question of the dissent sect of the american alliance of the samara famine of exhibitions and of spiritualism be definitely replace in public interest by the slavonic question which have hitherto rather languidly interest society and sergey ivanovitch who have be one of the first to raise this subject throw himself into it heart and soul in the circle to which sergey ivanovitch belong nothing be talk of or write about just now but the servian war everything that the idle crowd usually do to kill time be do now for the benefit of the slavonic states ball concert dinner matchbox lady  dress beer restaurant — everything testify to sympathy with the slavonic people from much of what be speak and write on the subject sergey ivanovitch differ on various point he see that the slavonic question have become one of those fashionable distraction which succeed one another in provide society with an object and an occupation he see too that a great many people be take up the subject from motive of selfinterest and selfadvertisement he recognize that the newspaper publish a great deal that be superfluous and exaggerated with the sole aim of attract attention and outbid one another he see that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shout the loud be man who have fail and be smart under a sense of injury — general without army minister not in the ministry journalist not on any paper party leader without follower he see that there be a great deal in it that be frivolous and absurd but he see and recognize an unmistakable grow enthusiasm unite all class with which it be impossible not to sympathize the massacre of man who be fellow christians and of the same slavonic race excite sympathy for the sufferer and indignation against the oppressor and the heroism of the servians and montenegrins struggle for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brother not in word but in deed but in this there be another aspect that rejoice sergey ivanovitch that be the manifestation of public opinion the public have definitely express its desire the soul of the people have as sergey ivanovitch say find expression and the more he work in this cause the more incontestable it seem to he that it be a cause destine to assume vast dimension to create an epoch he throw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause and forget to think about his book his whole time now be engross by it so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letter and appeal address to he he work the whole spring and part of the summer and it be only in july that he prepare to go away to his brother ’s in the country he be go both to rest for a fortnight and in the very heart of the people in the farth wild of the country to enjoy the sight of that uplift of the spirit of the people of which like all resident in the capital and big town he be fully persuade katavasov have long be mean to carry out his promise to stay with levin and so he be go with he chapter 2 sergey ivanovitch and katavasov have only just reach

for you eh princess  he turn to the lady the princess look at koznishev without reply but the fact that sergey ivanovitch and the princess seem anxious to get rid of he do not in the least disconcert stepan arkadyevitch smile he stare at the feather in the princess ’s hat and then about he as though he be go to pick something up see a lady approach with a collecting box he beckon she up and put in

vronsky be he have completely forget his own despairing sob over his sister ’s corpse and he see in vronsky only a hero and an old friend  with all his fault one can not refuse to do he justice  say the princess to sergey ivanovitch as soon as stepan arkadyevitch have leave they  what a typically russian slav nature only i ’m afraid it will not be pleasant for vronsky to see he say what you will i ’m touch by that man ’s fate do talk to he a little on the way  say the princess  yes perhaps if it happen so   i never like he but this atone for a great deal he ’ not merely go himself he ’ take a squadron at his own expense   yes so i hear  a bell sound everyone crowd to the door  here he be  say the princess indicate vronsky who with his mother on his arm walk by wear a long overcoat and widebrimmed black hat oblonsky be walk beside he talk eagerly of something vronsky be frown and look straight before he as though he do not hear what stepan arkadyevitch be say probably on oblonsky ’s point they out he look round in the direction where the princess and sergey ivanovitch be stand and without speak lift his hat his face age and wear by suffering look stony go onto the platform vronsky leave his mother and disappear into a compartment on the platform there ring out  god save the tsar  then shout of  hurrah  and  jivio  one of the volunteer a tall very young man with a hollow chest be particularly conspicuous bow and wave his felt hat and a nosegay over his head then two officer emerge bow too and a stout man with a big beard wear a greasy forage cap say goodbye to the princess sergey ivanovitch be join by katavasov together they get into a carriage full to overflow and the train start at tsaritsino station the train be meet by a chorus of young man singe  hail to thee  again the volunteer bow and poke their head out but sergey ivanovitch pay no attention to they he have have so much to do with the volunteer that the type be familiar to he and do not interest he katavasov whose scientific work have prevent his have a chance of observe they hitherto be very much interested in they and question sergey ivanovitch sergey ivanovitch advise he to go into the secondclass and talk to they himself at the next station katavasov act on this suggestion at the first stop he move into the secondclass and make the acquaintance of the volunteer they be sit in a corner of the carriage talk loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passenger and katavasov as he get in be concentrate upon they more loudly than all talk the tall hollowchested young man he be unmistakably tipsy and be relate some story that have occur at his school face he sit a middleaged officer in the austrian military jacket of the guards uniform he be listen with a smile to the hollowchested youth and occasionally pull he up the third in an artillery uniform be sit on a box beside they a fourth be asleep enter into conversation with the youth katavasov learn that he be a wealthy moscow merchant who have run through a large fortune before he be twoandtwenty katavasov do not like he because he be unmanly and effeminate and sickly he be obviously convinced especially now after drinking that he be perform a heroic action and he brag of it in the most unpleasant way the second the retire officer make an unpleasant impression too upon katavasov he be it seem a man who have try everything he have be on a railway have be a landsteward and have start factory and he talk quite without necessity of all he have do and use learned expression quite inappropriately the third the artilleryman on the contrary strike katavasov very favorably he be a quiet modest fellow unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic selfsacrifice of the merchant and say nothing about himself when katavasov ask he what have impel he to go to servia he answer modestly  oh well everyone ’ go the servians want help too i ’m sorry for they   yes you artilleryman especially be scarce there  say katavasov  oh i be not long in the artillery maybe they ’ll put i into the infantry or the cavalry   into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything  say katavasov fancy from the artilleryman ’s apparent age that he must have reach a fairly high grade  i be not long in the artillery i ’m a cadet retire  he say and he begin to explain how he have fail in his examination all of this together make a disagreeable impression on katavasov and when the volunteer get out at a station for a drink katavasov would have like to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone there be an old man in the carriage wear a military overcoat who have be listen all the while to katavasov ’s conversation with the volunteer when they be leave alone katavasov address he  what different position they come from all those fellow who be go off there  katavasov say vaguely not wish to express his own opinion and at the same time anxious to find out the old man ’s view the old man be an officer who have serve on two campaign he know what make a soldier and judge by the appearance and the talk of those person by the swagger with which they have recourse to the bottle on the journey he consider they poor soldier moreover he live in a district town and he be long to tell how one soldier have volunteer from his town a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer but know by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it be dangerous to express an opinion oppose to the general one and especially to criticize the volunteer unfavorably he too watch katavasov without commit himself  well man be want there  he say laugh with his eye and they fall to talk of the last war news and each conceal from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expect next day since the turk have be beat accord to the late news at all point and so they part neither give expression to his opinion katavasov go back to his own carriage and with reluctant hypocrisy report to sergey ivanovitch his observation of the volunteer from which it would appear that they be capital fellow at a big station at a town the volunteer be again greet with shout and singing again man and woman with collect box appear and provincial lady bring bouquet to the volunteer and follow they into the refreshment room but all this be on a much small and feeble scale than in moscow while the train be stop at the provincial town sergey ivanovitch do not go to the refreshment room but walk up and down the platform the first time he pass vronsky ’s compartment he notice that the curtain be draw over the window but as he pass it the second time he see the old countess at the window she beckon to koznishev  i ’m go you see take he as far as kursk  she say  yes so i hear  say sergey ivanovitch stand at her window and peep in  what a noble act on his part  he add notice that vronsky be not in the compartment  yes after his misfortune what be there for he to do   what a terrible thing it be  say sergey ivanovitch  ah what i have be through but do get in ah what i have be through  she repeat when sergey ivanovitch have get in and sit down beside she  you can not conceive it for six week he do not speak to anyone and would not touch food except when i implore he and not for one minute could we leave he alone we take away everything he could have use against himself we live on the ground floor but there be no reckoning on anything you know of course that he have shoot himself once already on her account  she say and the old lady ’s eyelash twitch at the recollection  yes hers be the fitting end for such a woman even the death she choose be low and vulgar   it ’ not for we to judge countess  say sergey ivanovitch  but i can understand that it have be very hard for you   ah do not speak of it i be stay on my estate and he be with i a note be bring he he write an answer and send it off we have not an idea that she be close by at the station in the evening i have only just go to my room when my mary tell i a lady have throw herself under the train something seem to strike i at once i know it be she

word but gallop off there i do not know to this day what happen there but he be bring back at death ’s door i should not have know he prostration complète the doctor say and that be follow almost by madness oh why talk of it  say the countess with a wave of her hand  it be an awful time no say what you will she be a bad woman why what be the meaning of such desperate passion it be all to show herself something out of the way well and that she do do she bring herself to ruin and two good man — her husband and my unhappy son   and what do her husband do  ask sergey ivanovitch  he have take her daughter alexey be ready to agree to anything at first now it worry he terribly that he should have give his own child away to another man but he can not take back his word karenin come to the funeral but we try to prevent his meeting alexey for he for her husband it be easy anyway she have set he free but my poor son be utterly give up to she he have throw up everything his career i and even then she have no mercy on he but of set purpose she make his ruin complete no say what you will her very death be the death of a vile woman of no religious feeling god forgive i but i can not help hate the memory of she when i look at my son ’s misery   but how be he now   it be a blessing from providence for we — this servian war i ’m old and i do not understand the right and wrong of it but it ’ come as a providential blessing to he of course for i as his mother it ’ terrible and what ’ bad they say ce n’est pas très bien vu à pétersbourg but it can not be help it be the one thing that could rouse he yashvin — a friend of his — he have lose all he have at card and he be go to servia he come to see he and persuade he to go now it ’ an interest for he do please talk to he a little i want to distract his mind he ’ so lowspirited and as bad luck would have it he have toothache too but he ’ll be delighted to see you please do talk to he he ’ walk up and down on that side  sergey ivanovitch say he would be very glad to and cross over to the other side of the station in the slant evening shadow cast by the baggage pile up on the platform vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat with his hand in his pocket stride up and down like a wild beast in a cage turn sharply after twenty pace sergey ivanovitch fancy as he approach he that vronsky see he but be pretend not to see this do not affect sergey ivanovitch in the slight he be above all personal consideration with vronsky at that moment sergey ivanovitch look upon vronsky as a man take an important part in a great cause and koznishev think it his duty to encourage he and express his approval he go up to he vronsky stand still look intently at he recognize he and go a few step forward to meet he shake hand with he very warmly  possibly you do not wish to see i  say sergey ivanovitch  but could not i be of use to you   there ’ no one i should less dislike see than you  say vronsky  excuse i and there ’ nothing in life for i to like   i quite understand and i merely mean to offer you my service  say sergey ivanovitch scan vronsky ’s face full of unmistakable suffering  would not it be of use to you to have a letter to ristitch — to milan   oh no  vronsky say seem to understand he with difficulty  if you do not mind let ’s walk on it ’ so stuffy among the carriage a letter no thank you to meet death one need no letter of introduction nor for the turk  he say with a smile that be merely of the lip his eye still keep their look of angry suffering  yes but you might find it easy to get into relation which be after all essential with anyone prepare to see you but that ’ as you like i be very glad to hear of your intention there have be so many attack make on the volunteer and a man like you raise they in public estimation   my use as a man  say vronsky  be that life ’ worth nothing to i and that i ’ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their rank and to trample on they or fall — i know that i ’m glad there ’ something to give my life for for it ’ not simply useless but loathsome to i anyone ’s welcome to it  and his jaw twitch impatiently from the incessant gnaw toothache that prevent he from even speak with a natural expression  you will become another man i predict  say sergey ivanovitch feel touch  to deliver one ’s brotherman from bondage be an aim worth death and life god grant you success outwardly — and inwardly peace  he add and he hold out his hand vronsky warmly press his outstretched hand  yes as a weapon i may be of some use but as a man i ’m a wreck  he jerk out he could hardly speak for the throb ache in his strong tooth that be like row of ivory in his mouth he be silent and his eye rest on the wheel of the tender slowly and smoothly roll along the rail and all at once a different pain not an ache but an inner trouble that set his whole being in anguish make he for an instant forget his toothache as he glance at the tender and the rail under the influence of the conversation with a friend he have not meet since his misfortune he suddenly recall she — that be what be leave of she when he have run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station — on the table shamelessly sprawl out among stranger the bloodstained body so lately full of life the head unhurt drop back with its weight of hair and the curl tress about the temple and the exquisite face with red halfopened mouth the strange fixed expression piteous on the lip and awful in the still open eye that seem to utter that fearful phrase — that he would be sorry for it — that she have say when they be quarrel and he try to think of she as she be when he meet she the first time at a railway station too mysterious exquisite love seek and give happiness and not cruelly revengeful as he remember she on that last moment he try to recall his good moment with she but those moment be poison forever he could only think of she as triumphant successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be efface he lose all consciousness of toothache and his face work with sob pass twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regain his selfpossession he address sergey ivanovitch calmly  you have have no telegram since yesterday ’s yes drive back for a third time but a decisive engagement expect for tomorrow  and after talk a little more of king milan ’s proclamation and the immense effect it might have they part go to their carriage on hear the second bell sergey ivanovitch have not telegraph to his brother to send to meet he as he do not know

anything  and a recent instance of his goodness rise vividly to her mind a fortnight ago a penitent letter have come from stepan arkadyevitch to dolly he beseech she to save his honor to sell her estate to pay his debt dolly be in despair she detest her husband despise he pity he resolve on a separation resolve to refuse but end by agree to sell part of her property after that with an irrepressible smile of tenderness kitty recall her husband ’s shamefaced embarrassment his repeat awkward effort to approach the subject and how at last have think of the one mean of help dolly without wound her pride he have suggest to kitty — what have not occur to she before — that she should give up her share of the property  he an unbeliever indeed with his heart his dread of offend anyone even a child everything for other nothing for himself sergey ivanovitch simply consider it as kostya ’s duty to be his steward and it ’ the same with his sister now dolly and her child be under his guardianship all these peasant who come to he every day as though he be bind to be at their service   yes only be like your father only like he  she say hand mitya over to the nurse and put her lip to his cheek chapter 8 ever since by his beloved brother ’s deathbed levin have first glance into the question of life and death in the light of these new conviction as he call they which have during the period from his twentieth to his thirtyfourth year imperceptibly replace his childish and youthful belief — he have be stricken with horror not so much of death as of life without any knowledge of whence and why and how and what it be the physical organization its decay the indestructibility of matter the law of the conservation of energy evolution be the word which usurp the place of his old belief these word and the idea associate with they be very well for intellectual purpose but for life they yield nothing and levin feel suddenly like a man who have change his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment and go for the first time into the frost be immediately convince not by reason but by his whole nature that he be as good as naked and that he must infallibly perish miserably from that moment though he do not distinctly face it and still go on live as before levin have never lose this sense of terror at his lack of knowledge he vaguely feel too that what he call his new conviction be not merely lack of knowledge but that they be part of a whole order of idea in which no knowledge of what he need be possible at first marriage with the new joy and duty bind up with it have completely crowd out these thought but of late while he be stay in moscow after his wife ’s confinement with nothing to do the question that clamor for solution have more and more often more and more insistently haunt levin ’s mind the question be sum up for he thus  if i do not accept the answer christianity give to the problem of my life what answer do i accept  and in the whole arsenal of his conviction so far from find any satisfactory answer he be utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer he be in the position of a man seek food in toy shop and tool shop instinctively unconsciously with every book with every conversation with every man he meet he be on the lookout for light on these question and their solution what puzzle and distract he above everything be that the majority of man of his age and circle have like he exchange their old belief for the same new conviction and yet see nothing to lament in this and be perfectly satisfied and serene so that apart from the principal question levin be torture by other question too be these people sincere he ask himself or be they play a part or be it that they understand the answer science give to these problem in some different clear sense than he do and he assiduously study both these man ’s opinion and the book which treat of these scientific explanation one fact he have find out since these question have engross his mind be that he have be quite wrong in suppose from the recollection of the circle of his young day at college that religion have outlive its day and that it be now practically nonexistent all the people near to he who be good in their life be believer the old prince and lvov whom he like so much and sergey ivanovitch and all the woman believe and his wife believe as simply as he have believe in his early childhood and ninetynine hundredth of the russian people all the work people for whose life he feel the deep respect believe another fact of which he become convinced after read many scientific book be that the man who share his view have no other construction to put on they and that they give no explanation of the question which he feel he could not live without answer but simply ignore their existence and attempt to explain other question of no possible interest to he such as the evolution of organism the materialistic theory of consciousness and so forth moreover during his wife ’s confinement something have happen that seem extraordinary to he he an unbeliever have fall into pray and at the moment he pray he believe but that moment have pass and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his life he could not admit that at that moment he know the truth and that now he be wrong for as soon as he begin think calmly about it it all fall to piece he could not admit that he be mistake then for his spiritual condition then be precious to he and to admit that it be a proof of weakness would have be to desecrate those moment he be miserably divide against himself and strain all his spiritual force to the utmost to escape from this condition chapter 9 these doubt fret and harass he grow weak or strong from time to time but never leave he he read and think and the more he read and the more he think the far he feel from the aim he be pursue of late in moscow and in the country since he have become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialist he have read and reread thoroughly plato spinoza kant schelling hegel and schopenhauer the philosopher who give a nonmaterialistic explanation of life their idea seem to he fruitful when he be read or be himself seek argument to refute other theory especially those of the materialist but as soon as he begin to read or seek for himself a solution of problem the same thing always happen as long as he follow the fixed definition of obscure word such as spirit will freedom essence purposely let himself go into the snare of word the philosopher set for he he seem to comprehend something but he have only to forget the artificial train of reasoning and to turn from life itself to what have satisfy he while think in accordance with the fix definition and all this artificial edifice fall to piece at once like a house of card and it become clear that the edifice have be build up out of those transpose word apart from anything in life more important than reason at one time read schopenhauer he put in place of his will the word love and for a couple of day this new philosophy charm he till he remove a little away from it but then when he turn from life itself to glance at it again it fall away too and prove to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it his brother sergey ivanovitch advise he to read the theological work of homiakov levin read the second volume of homiakov ’s work and in spite of the elegant epigrammatic argumentative style which at first repel he he be impress by the doctrine of the church he find in they he be strike at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truth have not be vouchsafe to man but to a corporation of man bind together by love — to the church what delight he be the thought how much easy it be to believe in a still exist live church embrace all the belief of man and have god at its head and therefore holy and infallible and from it to accept the faith in god in the creation the fall the redemption than to begin with god a mysterious faraway god the creation etc but afterwards on read a catholic writer ’s history of the church and then a greek orthodox writer ’s history of the church and see that the two church in their very conception infallible each deny the authority of the other homiakov ’s doctrine of the church lose all its charm for he and this edifice crumble into dust like the philosopher  edifice all that spring he be not himself and go through fearful moment of horror  without know what i be and why i be here life ’ impossible and that i can not know and so i can not live  levin say to himself  in infinite time in infinite matter in infinite space be form a bubbleorganism and that bubble last a while and burst and that bubble be i  it be an agonizing error but it be the sole logical result of age of human thought in that direction this be the ultimate belief on which all the system elaborate by human thought in almost all their ramification rest it be the prevalent conviction and of all other explanation levin have unconsciously not know when or how choose it as anyway the clear and make it his own but it be not merely a falsehood it be the cruel jeer of some wicked power some evil hateful power to whom one could not submit he must escape from this power and the mean of escape every man have in his own hand he have but to cut short this dependence on evil and there be one mean — death and levin a happy father and husband in perfect health be several time so near suicide that he hide the cord that he might not be tempt to hang himself and be afraid to go out with his gun for fear of shoot himself but levin do not shoot himself and do not hang himself he go on live when levin think what he be and what he be live for he could find no answer to the question and be reduce to despair but he leave off question himself about it it seem as though he know both what he be and for what he be live for he act and live resolutely and without hesitation indeed in these latter day he be far more decided and unhesitating in life than he have ever be when he go back to the country at the beginning of june he go back also to his usual pursuit the management of the estate his relation with the peasant and the neighbor the care of his household the management of his sister ’s and brother ’s property of which he have the direction his relation with his wife and kindred the care of his child and the new beekeeping hobby he have take up that spring fill all his time these thing occupy he now not because he justify they to himself by any sort of general principle as he have do in former day on the contrary disappoint by the failure of his former effort for the general welfare and too much occupy with his own thought and the mass of business with which he be burden from all side he have completely give up thinking of the general good and he busy himself with all this work simply because it seem to he that he must do what he be do — that he could not do otherwise in former day — almost from childhood and increasingly up to full manhood — when he have try to do anything that would be good for all for humanity for russia for the whole village he have notice that the idea of it have be pleasant but the work itself have always be incoherent that then he have never have a full conviction of its absolute necessity and that the work that have begin by seem so great have grow less and less till it vanish into nothing but now since his marriage when he have begin to confine himself more and more to live for himself though he experience no delight at all at the thought of the work he be do he feel a complete conviction of its necessity see that it succeed far well than in old day and that it keep on grow more and more now involuntarily it seem he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough so that he could not be draw out without turn aside the furrow to live the same family life as his father and forefather — that be in the same condition of culture — and to bring up his child in the same be incontestably necessary it be as necessary as dine when one be hungry and to do this just as it be necessary to cook dinner it be necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at pokrovskoe go so as to yield an income just as incontestably as it be necessary to repay a debt be it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son when he receive it as a heritage would say  thank you  to his father as levin have say  thank you  to his grandfather for all he build and plant and to do this it be necessary to look after the land himself not to let it and to breed cattle manure the field and plant timber it be impossible not to look after the affair of sergey ivanovitch of his sister of the peasant who come to he for advice and be accustom to do so — as impossible as to fling down a child one be carry in one ’s arm it be necessary to look after the comfort of his sisterinlaw and her child and of his wife and baby and it be impossible not to spend with they at least a short time each day and all this together with shooting and his new beekeeping fill up the whole of levin ’s life which have no meaning at all for he when he begin to think but besides know thoroughly what he have to do levin know in just the same way how he have to do it all and what be more important than the rest he know he must hire laborer as cheaply as possible but to hire man under bond pay they in advance at less than the current rate of wage be what he must not do even though it be very profitable sell straw to the peasant in time of scarcity of provender be what he might do even though he feel sorry for they but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down though they be a source of income fell timber must be punish as severely as possible but he could not exact forfeit for cattle be drive onto his field and though it annoy the keeper and make the peasant not afraid to graze their cattle on his land he could not keep their cattle as a punishment to pyotr who be pay a moneylender ten per cent a month he must lend a sum of money to set he free but he could not let off peasant who do not pay their rent nor let they fall into arrear it be impossible to overlook the bailiff ’s not have mow the meadow and let the hay spoil and it be equally impossible to mow those acre where a young copse have be plant it be impossible to excuse a laborer who have go home in the busy season because his father be die however sorry he might feel for he and he must subtract from his pay those costly month of idleness but it be impossible not to allow monthly ration to the old servant who be of no use for anything levin know that when he get home he must first of all go to his wife who be unwell and that the peasant who have be wait for three hour to see he could wait a little long he know too that regardless of all the pleasure he feel in take a swarm he must forego that pleasure and leave the old man to see to the bee alone while he talk to the peasant who have come after he to the beehouse whether he be act rightly or wrongly he do not know and far from try to prove that he be nowadays he avoid all thought or talk about it reasoning have bring he to doubt and prevent he from see what he ought to do and what he ought not when he do not think but simply live he be continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul determine which of two possible course of action be the well and which be the bad and as soon as he do not act rightly he be at once aware of it so he live not know and not see any chance of know what he be and what he be live for and harass at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he be afraid of suicide and yet firmly lay down his own individual definite path in life the day on which sergey ivanovitch come to pokrovskoe be one of levin ’s most painful day it be the very busy working time when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of selfsacrifice in labor such as be never show in any other condition of life and would be highly esteem if the man who show these quality themselves think highly of they and if it be not repeat every year and if the result of this intense labor be not so simple to reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it to mow the meadow turn over the fallow thrash the seed and sow the winter corn — all this seem so simple and ordinary but to succeed in get through it all everyone in the village from the old man to the young child must toil incessantly for three or four week three time as hard as usual live on ryebeer onion and black bread thrash and carry the sheaf at night and not give more than two or three hour in the twentyfour to sleep and every year this be do all over russia have live the great part of his life in the country and in the close relation with the peasant levin always feel in this busy time that he be infect by this general quickening of energy in the people in the early morning he ride over to the first sowing of the rye and to the oats which be be carry to the stack and return home at the time his wife and sisterinlaw be get up he drink coffee with they and walk to the farm where a new thrash machine be to be set work to get ready the seedcorn he be stand in the cool granary still fragrant with the leave of the hazel branch interlace on the freshly peel aspen beam of the new thatch roof he gaze through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrash whirl and play at the grass of the thrash floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that have be bring in from the barn then at the specklyheaded whitebreasted swallow that fly chirp in under the roof and flutter their wing settle in the crevice of the doorway then at the peasant bustle in the dark dusty barn and he think strange thought  why be it all be do  he think  why be i stand here make they work what be you all so busy for try to show their zeal before i what be that old matrona my old friend toil for i doctor she when the beam fall on she in the fire  he think look at a thin old woman who be rake up the grain move painfully with her bare sunblackene foot over the uneven rough floor  then she recover but today or tomorrow or in ten year she will not they ’ll bury she and nothing will be leave either of she or of that smart girl in the red jacket who with that skillful soft action shake the ear out of their husk they ’ll bury she and this piebald horse and very soon too  he think gaze at the heavily move pant horse that keep walk up the wheel that turn under he  and they will bury she and fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt tear on his white shoulder — they will bury he he ’ untie the sheaf and give order and shout to the woman and quickly set straight the strap on the move wheel and what ’ more it ’ not they alone — i they ’ll bury too and nothing will be leave what for  he think this and at the same time look at his watch to reckon how much they thrash in an hour he want to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day  it ’ll soon be one and they ’re only begin the third sheaf  think levin he go up to the man that be feed the machine and shout over the roar of the machine he tell he to put it in more slowly  you put in too much at a time fyodor do you see — it get choke that ’ why it be not get on do it evenly  fyodor black with the dust that cling to his moist face shout something in response but still go on do it as levin do not want he to levin go up to the machine move fyodor aside and begin feed the corn in himself work on till the peasant  dinner hour which be not long in come he go out of the barn with fyodor and fall into talk with he stop beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye lay on the thrash floor for seed fyodor come from a village at some distance from the one in which levin have once allot land to his cooperative association now it have be let to a former house porter levin talk to fyodor about this land and ask whether platon a welltodo peasant of good character belong to the same village would not take the land for the come year  it ’ a high rent it would not pay platon konstantin dmitrievitch  answer the peasant pick the ear off his sweatdrenched shirt  but how do kirillov make it pay   mituh  so the peasant call the house porter in a tone of contempt  you may be sure he ’ll make it pay konstantin dmitrievitch he ’ll get his share however he have to squeeze to get it he ’ no mercy on a christian but uncle fokanitch  so he call the old peasant platon  do you suppose he ’d flay the skin off a man where there ’ debt he ’ll let anyone off and he ’ll not wring the last penny out he ’ a man too   but why will he let anyone off   oh well of course folk be different one man live for his own want and nothing else like mituh he only think of fill his belly but fokanitch be a righteous man he live for his soul he do not forget god   how think of god how do he live for his soul  levin almost shout  why to be sure in truth in god ’s way folk be different take you now you would not wrong a man   yes yes goodbye  say levin breathless with excitement and turn round he take his stick and walk quickly away towards home at the peasant ’s word that fokanitch live for his soul in truth in god ’s way undefined but significant idea seem to burst out as though they have be lock up and all strive towards one goal they throng whirl through his head blind he with their light levin stride along the highroad absorb not so much in his thought he could not yet disentangle they as in his spiritual condition unlike anything he have experience before the word utter by the peasant have act on his soul like an electric shock suddenly transform and combine into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed impotent separate thought that incessantly occupy his mind these thought have unconsciously be in his mind even when he be talk about the land he be aware of something new in his soul and joyfully test this new thing not yet know what it be  not live for his own want but for god for what god and could one say anything more senseless than what he say he say that one must not live for one ’s own want that be that one must not live for what we understand what we be attract by what we desire but must live for something incomprehensible for god whom no one can understand nor even define what of it do not i understand those senseless word of fyodor ’s and understand they do i doubt of their truth do i think they stupid obscure inexact no i understand he and exactly as he understand the word i understand they more fully and clearly than i understand anything in life and never in my life have i doubt nor can i doubt about it and not only i but everyone the whole world understand nothing fully but this and about this only they have no doubt and be always agree  and i look out for miracle complain that i do not see a miracle which would convince i a material miracle would have persuade i and here be a miracle the sole miracle possible continually exist surround i on all side and i never notice it  fyodor say that kirillov live for his belly that ’ comprehensible and rational all of we as rational being can not do anything else but live for our belly and all of a sudden the same fyodor say that one must not live for one ’s belly but must live for truth for god and at a hint i understand he and i and million of man man who live age ago and man live now — peasant the poor in spirit and the learned who have think and write about it in their obscure word say the same thing — we be all agree about this one thing what we must live for and what be good i and all man have only one firm incontestable clear knowledge and that knowledge can not be explain by the reason — it be outside it and have no cause and can have no effect  if goodness have cause it be not goodness if it have effect a reward it be not goodness either so goodness be outside the chain of cause and effect  and yet i know it and we all know it  what could be a great miracle than that  can i have find the solution of it all can my suffering be over  think levin stride along the dusty road not notice the heat nor his weariness and experience a sense of relief from prolonged suffering this feeling be so delicious that it seem to he incredible he be breathless with emotion and incapable of go far he turn off the road into the forest and lie down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass he take his hat off his hot head and lie prop on his elbow in the lush feathery woodland grass  yes i must make it clear to myself and understand  he think look intently at the untrampled grass before he and follow the movement of a green beetle advance along a blade of couchgrass and lift up in its progress a leaf of goatweed  what have i discover  he ask himself bend aside the leaf of goatweed out of the beetle ’s way and twist another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it  what be it make i glad what have i discover  i have discover nothing i have only find out what i know i understand the force that in the past give i life and now too give i life i have be set free from falsity i have find the master  of old i use to say that in my body that in the body of this grass and of this beetle there she do not care for the grass she ’ open her wing and fly away there be go on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical chemical and physiological law and in all of we as well as in the aspen and the cloud and the misty patch there be a process of evolution evolution from what into what — eternal evolution and struggle as though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal and i be astonish that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road i could not discover the meaning of life the meaning of my impulse and yearning now i say that i know the meaning of my life  to live for god for my soul  and this meaning in spite of its clearness be mysterious and marvelous such indeed be the meaning of everything exist yes pride  he say to himself turn over on his stomach and begin to tie a noose of blade of grass try not to break they  and not merely pride of intellect but dulness of intellect and most of all the deceitfulness yes the deceitfulness of intellect the cheat knavishness of intellect that ’ it  he say to himself and he briefly go through mentally the whole course of his idea during the last two year the beginning of which be the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill then for the first time grasp that for every man and himself too there be nothing in store but suffer death and forgetfulness he have make up his mind that life be impossible like that and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to he as the evil jest of some devil or shoot himself but he have not do either but have go on live think and feel and have even at that very time marry and have have many joy and have be happy when he be not think of the meaning of his life what do this mean it mean that he have be live rightly but think wrongly he have live without be aware of it on those spiritual truth that he have suck in with his mother ’s milk but he have think not merely without recognition of these truth but studiously ignore they now it be clear to he that he could only live by virtue of the belief in which he have be bring up  what should i have be and how should i have spend my life if i have not have these belief if i have not know that i must live for god and not for my own desire i should have rob and lie and kill nothing of what make the chief happiness of my life would have exist for i  and with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have be himself if he have not know what he be live for  i look for an answer to my question and think could not give an answer to my question — it be incommensurable with my question the answer have be give i by life itself in my knowledge of what be right and what be wrong and that knowledge i do not arrive at in any way it be give to i as to all man give because i could not have get it from anywhere  where could i have get it by reason could i have arrive at know that i must love my neighbor and not oppress he i be tell that in my childhood and i believe it gladly for they tell i what be already in my soul but who discover it not reason reason discover the struggle for existence and the law that require we to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desire that be the deduction of reason but love one ’s neighbor reason could never discover because it ’ irrational  chapter 13 and levin remember a scene he have lately witness between dolly and her child the child leave to themselves have begin cook raspberry over the candle and squirt milk into each other ’s mouth with a syringe their mother catch they at these prank begin remind they in levin ’s presence of the trouble their mischief give to the grownup people and that this trouble be all for their sake and that if they smash the cup they would have nothing to drink their tea out of and that if they waste the milk they would have nothing to eat and die of hunger and levin have be strike by the passive weary incredulity with which the child hear what their mother say to they they be simply annoyed that their amusing play have be interrupt and do not believe a word of what their mother be say they could not believe it indeed for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoy and so could not conceive that what they be destroy be the very thing they live by  that all come of itself  they think  and there ’ nothing interesting or important about it because it have always be so and always will be so and it ’ all always the same we ’ve no need to think about that it ’ all ready but we want to invent something of our own and new so we think of put raspberry in a cup and cook they over a candle and squirt milk straight into each other ’s mouth that ’ fun and something new and not a bit bad than drink out of cup   be not it just the same that we do that i do search by the aid of reason for the significance of the force of nature and the meaning of the life of man  he think  and do not all the theory of philosophy do the same trying by the path of thought which be strange and not natural to man to bring he to a knowledge of what he have know long ago and know so certainly that he could not live at all without it be not it distinctly to be see in the development of each philosopher ’s theory that he know what be the chief significance of life beforehand just as positively as the peasant fyodor and not a bit more clearly than he and be simply try by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone know  now then leave the child to themselves to get thing alone and make their crockery get the milk from the cow and so on would they be naughty then why they ’d die of hunger well then leave we with our passion and thought without any idea of the one god of the creator or without any idea of what be right without any idea of moral evil  just try and build up anything without those idea  we only try to destroy they because we ’re spiritually provide for exactly like the child  whence have i that joyful knowledge share with the peasant that alone give peace to my soul whence do i get it  bring up with an idea of god a christian my whole life fill with the spiritual blessing christianity have give i full of they and live on those blessing like the child i do not understand they and destroy that be try to destroy what i live by and as soon as an important moment of life come like the child when they be cold and hungry i turn to he and even less than the child when their mother scold they for their childish mischief do i feel that my childish effort at wanton madness be reckon against i  yes what i know i know not by reason but it have be give to i reveal to i and i know it with my heart by faith in the chief thing teach by the church  the church the church  levin repeat to himself he turn over on the other side and lean on his elbow fall to gaze into the distance at a herd of cattle cross over to the river  but can i believe in all the church teach  he think try himself and think of everything that could destroy his present peace of mind intentionally he recall all those doctrine of the church which have always seem most strange and have always be a stumbling block to he  the creation but how do i explain existence by existence by nothing the devil and sin but how do i explain evil the atonement  but i know nothing nothing and i can know nothing but what have be tell to i and all man  and it seem to he that there be not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing — faith in god in goodness as the one goal of man ’s destiny under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one ’s desire and each doctrine do not simply leave that faith unshaken each doctrine seem essential to complete that great miracle continually manifest upon earth that make it possible for each man and million of different sort of man wise man and imbecile old man and child — all man peasant lvov kitty beggar and king to understand perfectly the same one thing and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone be worth live and which alone be precious to we lie on his back he gaze up now into the high cloudless sky  do i not know that that be infinite space and that it be not a round arch but however i screw up my eye and strain my sight i can not see it not round and not bounded and in spite of my know about infinite space i be incontestably right when i see a solid blue dome and more right than when i strain my eye to see beyond it  levin cease think and only as it be listen to mysterious voice that seem talk joyfully and earnestly within he  can this be faith  he think afraid to believe in his happiness  my god i thank thee  he say gulp down his sob and with both hand brush away the tear that fill his eye levin look before he and see a herd of cattle then he catch sight of his trap with raven in the shaft and the coachman who drive up to the herd say something to the herdsman then he hear the rattle of the wheel and the snort of the sleek horse close by he but he be so buried in his thought that he do not even wonder why the coachman have come for he he only think of that when the coachman have drive quite up to he and shout to he  the mistress send i your brother have come and some gentleman with he  levin get into the trap and take the rein as though just rouse out of sleep for a long while levin could not collect his faculty he stare at the sleek horse fleck with lather between his haunch and on his neck where the harness rub stare at ivan the coachman sit beside he and remember that he be expect his brother think that his wife be most likely uneasy at his long absence and try to guess who be the visitor who have come with his brother and his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seem to he now quite different from before he fancy that now his relation with all man would be different  with my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always use to be between we there will be no dispute with kitty there shall never be quarrel with the visitor whoever he may be i will be friendly and nice with the servant with ivan it will all be different  pull the stiff rein and hold in the good horse that snort with impatience and seem beg to be let go levin look round at ivan sit beside he not know what to do with his unoccupied hand continually press down his shirt as it puff out and he try to find something to start a conversation about with he he would have say that ivan have pull the saddlegirth up too high but that be like blame and he long for friendly warm talk nothing else occur to he  your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump  say the coachman pull the rein levin hold  please do not touch and do not teach i  say levin anger by this interference now as always interference make he angry and he feel sorrowfully at once how mistaken have be his supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change he in contact with reality he be not a quarter of a mile from home when he see grisha and tanya run to meet he  uncle kostya mamma ’ come and grandfather and sergey ivanovitch and someone else  they say clamber up into the trap  who be he   an awfully terrible person and he do like this with his arm  say tanya get up in the trap and mimic katavasov  old or young  ask levin laugh remind of someone he do not know whom by tanya ’s performance  oh i hope it ’ not a tiresome person  think levin as soon as he turn at a bend in the road and see the party come levin recognize katavasov in a straw hat walk along swinge his arm just as tanya have show he katavasov be very fond of discuss metaphysic have derive his notion from natural science writer who have never study metaphysics and in moscow levin have have many argument with he of late and one of these argument in which katavasov have obviously consider that he come off victorious be the first thing levin think of as he recognize he  no whatever i do i will not argue and give utterance to my idea lightly  he think get out of the trap and greet his brother and katavasov levin ask about his wife  she have take mitya to kolok  a copse near the house  she mean to have he out there because it ’ so hot indoors  say dolly levin have always advise his wife not to take the baby to the wood think it unsafe and he be not pleased to hear this  she rush about from place to place with he  say the prince smile  i advise she to try put he in the ice cellar   she mean to come to the beehouse she think you would be there we be go there  say dolly  well and what be you do  say sergey ivanovitch fall back from the rest and walk beside he  oh nothing special busy as usual with the land  answer levin  well and what about you come for long we have be expect you for such a long time   only for a fortnight i ’ve a great deal to do in moscow  at these word the brother  eye meet and levin in spite of the desire he always have strong than ever just now to be on affectionate and still more open term with his brother feel an awkwardness in look at he he drop his eye and do not know what to say cast over the subject of conversation that would be pleasant to sergey ivanovitch and would keep he off the subject of the servian war and the slavonic question at which he have hint by the allusion to what he have to do in moscow levin begin to talk of sergey ivanovitch ’s book  well have there be review of your book  he ask sergey ivanovitch smile at the intentional character of the question  no one be interested in that now and i less than anyone  he say  just look darya alexandrovna we shall have a shower  he add point with a sunshade at the white rain cloud that show above the aspen treetop and these word be enough to reestablish again between the brother that tone — hardly hostile but chilly — which levin have be so long to avoid levin go up to katavasov  it be jolly of you to make up your mind to come  he say to he  i ’ve be mean to a long while now we shall have some discussion we ’ll see to that have you be read spencer   no i ’ve not finish read he  say levin  but i do not need he now   how ’ that that ’ interesting why so   i mean that i ’m fully convinced that the solution of the problem that interest i i shall never find in he and his like now  but katavasov ’s serene and goodhumored expression suddenly strike he and he feel such tenderness for his own happy mood which he be unmistakably disturbing by this conversation that he remember his resolution and stop short  but we ’ll talk later on  he add  if we ’re go to the beehouse it ’ this way along this little path  he say address they all go along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow cover on one side with thick clump of brilliant heart’sease among which stand up here and there tall dark green tuft of hellebore levin settle his guest in the dense cool shade of the young aspen on a bench and some stump purposely put there for visitor to the beehouse who might be afraid of the bee and he go off himself to the hut to get bread cucumber and fresh honey to regale they with try to make his movement as deliberate as possible and listen to the bee that buzz more and more frequently past he he walk along the little path to the hut in the very entry one bee hum angrily catch in his beard but he carefully extricate it go into the shady outer room he take down from the wall his veil that hang on a peg and put it on and thrust his hand into his pocket he go into the fencedin beegarden where there stand in the midst of a closely mow space in regular row fasten with bast on post all the hive he know so well the old stock each with its own history and along the fence the young swarm hive that year in front of the opening of the hive it make his eye giddy to watch the bee and drone whirl round and round about the same spot while among they the work bee fly in and out with spoil or in search of they always in the same direction into the wood to the flower lime tree and back to the hive his ear be fill with the incessant hum in various note now the busy hum of the work bee fly quickly off then the blaring of the lazy drone and the excited buzz of the bee on guard protect their property from the enemy and prepare to sting on the farther side of the fence the old beekeeper be shave a hoop for a tub and he do not see levin levin stand still in the midst of the beehive and do not call he he be glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life which have already depress his happy mood he think that he have already have time to lose his temper with ivan to show coolness to his brother and to talk flippantly with katavasov  can it have be only a momentary mood and will it pass and leave no trace  he think but the same instant go back to his mood he feel with delight that something new and important have happen to he real life have only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he have find but it be still untouched within he just as the bee whirl round he now menace he and distract his attention prevent he from enjoy complete physical peace force he to restrain his movement to avoid they so have the petty care that have swarm about he from the moment he get into the trap restrict his spiritual freedom but that last only so long as he be among they just as his bodily strength be still unaffected in spite of the bee so too be the spiritual strength that he have just become aware of chapter 15  do you know kostya with whom sergey ivanovitch travel on his way here  say dolly dole out cucumber and honey to the child  with vronsky he ’ go to servia   and not alone he ’ take a squadron out with he at his own expense  say katavasov  that ’ the right thing for he  say levin  be volunteer still go out then  he add glance at sergey ivanovitch sergey ivanovitch do not answer he be carefully with a blunt knife get a live bee cover with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb  i should think so you should have see what be go on at the station yesterday  say katavasov bite with a juicy sound into a cucumber  well what be one to make of it for mercy ’s sake do explain to i sergey ivanovitch where be all those volunteer go whom be they fight with  ask the old prince unmistakably take up a conversation that have spring up in levin ’s absence  with the turks  sergey ivanovitch answer smile serenely as he extricate the bee dark with honey and helplessly kick and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf  but who have declare war on the turks — ivan ivanovitch ragozov and countess lidia ivanovna assist by madame stahl   no one have declare war but people sympathize with their neighbor  suffering and be eager to help they  say sergey ivanovitch  but the prince be not speak of help  say levin come to the assistance of his fatherinlaw  but of war the prince say that private person can not take part in war without the permission of the government   kostya mind that ’ a bee really they ’ll sting we  say dolly wave away a wasp  but that ’ not a bee it ’ a wasp  say levin  well now well what ’ your own theory  katavasov say to levin with a smile distinctly challenge he to a discussion  why have not private person the right to do so   oh my theory ’ this war be on one side such a beastly cruel and awful thing that no one man not to speak of a christian can individually take upon himself the responsibility of begin war that can only be do by a government which be call upon to do this and be drive inevitably into war on the other hand both political science and common sense teach we that in matter of state and especially in the matter of war private citizen must forego their personal individual will  sergey ivanovitch and katavasov have their reply ready and both begin speak at the same time  but the point be my dear fellow that there may be case when the government do not carry out the will of the citizen and then the public assert its will  say katavasov but evidently sergey ivanovitch do not approve of this answer his brow contract at katavasov ’s word and he say something else  you do not put the matter in its true light there be no question here of a declaration of war but simply the expression of a human christian feeling our brother one with we in religion and in race be be massacre even suppose they be not our brother nor fellowchristians but simply child woman old people feel be arouse and russians go eagerly to help in stop these atrocity fancy if you be go along the street and see drunken man beat a woman or a child — i imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war have be declare on the man but would throw yourself on they and protect the victim   but i should not kill they  say levin  yes you would kill they   i do not know if i see that i might give way to my impulse of the moment but i can not say beforehand and such a momentary impulse there be not and there can not be in the case of the oppression of the slavonic people   possibly for you there be not but for other there be  say sergey ivanovitch frown with displeasure  there be tradition still extant among the people of slavs of the true faith suffer under the yoke of the  unclean son of hagar  the people have hear of the suffering of their brother and have speak   perhaps so  say levin evasively  but i do not see it i ’m one of the people myself and i do not feel it   here be i too  say the old prince  i ’ve be stay abroad and read the paper and i must own up to the time of the bulgarian atrocity i could not make out why it be all the russians be all of a sudden so fond of their slavonic brother while i do not feel the slight affection for they i be very much upset think i be a monster or that it be the influence of carlsbad on i but since i have be here my mind ’ be set at rest i see that there be people besides i who ’re only interested in russia and not in their slavonic brother here ’ konstantin too   personal opinion mean nothing in such a case  say sergey ivanovitch  it ’ not a matter of personal opinion when all russia — the whole people — have express its will   but excuse i i do not see that the people do not know anything about it if you come to that  say the old prince  oh papa how can you say that and last sunday in church  say dolly listen to the conversation  please give i a cloth  she say to the old man who be look at the child with a smile  why it ’ not possible that all   but what be it in church on sunday the priest have be tell to read that he read it they do not understand a word of it then they be tell that there be to be a collection for a pious object in church well they pull out their halfpence and give they but what for they could not say   the people can not help know the sense of their own destiny be always in the people and at such moment as the present that sense find utterance  say sergey ivanovitch with conviction glance at the old beekeeper the handsome old man with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair stand motionless hold a cup of honey look down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk obviously understand nothing of their conversation and not care to understand it  that ’ so no doubt  he say with a significant shake of his head at sergey ivanovitch ’s word  here then ask he he know nothing about it and think nothing  say levin  have you hear about the war mihalitch  he say turn to he  what they read in the church what do you think about it ought we to fight for the christians   what should we think alexander nikolaevitch our emperor have think for we he think for we indeed in all thing it ’ clear for he to see shall i bring a bit more bread give the little lad some more  he say address darya alexandrovna and point to grisha who have finish his crust  i do not need to ask  say sergey ivanovitch  we have see and be see hundred and hundred of people who give up everything to serve a just cause come from every part of russia and directly and clearly express their thought and aim they bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for what do it mean   it mean to my thinking  say levin who be begin to get warm  that among eighty million of people there can always be find not hundred as now but ten of thousand of people who have lose caste ne’erdowells who be always ready to go anywhere — to pogatchev ’s band to khiva to servia   i tell you that it ’ not a case of hundred or of ne’erdowells but the good representative of the people  say sergey ivanovitch with as much irritation as if he be defend the last penny of his fortune  and what of the subscription in this case it be a whole people directly express their will   that word  people  be so vague  say levin  parish clerk teacher and one in a thousand of the peasant maybe know what it ’ all about the rest of the eighty million like mihalitch far from express their will have not the faint idea what there be for they to express their will about what right have we to say that this be the people ’s will  chapter 16 sergey ivanovitch be practice in argument do not reply but at once turn the conversation to another aspect of the subject  oh if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation of course it ’ very difficult to arrive at it and voting have not be introduce among we and can not be introduce for it do not express the will of the people but there be other way of reach that it be feel in the air it be feel by the heart i will not speak of those deep current which be astir in the still ocean of the people and which be evident to every unprejudiced man let we look at society in the narrow sense all the most diverse section of the educated public hostile before be merge in one every division be at an end all the public organ say the same thing over and over again all feel the mighty torrent that have overtake they and be carry they in one direction   you all the newspaper do say the same thing  say the prince  that ’ true but so it be the same thing that all the frog croak before a storm one can hear nothing for they   frog or no frog i ’m not the editor of a paper and i do not want to defend they but i be speak of the unanimity in the intellectual world  say sergey ivanovitch address his brother levin would have answer but the old prince interrupt he  well about that unanimity that ’ another thing one may say  say the prince  there ’ my soninlaw stepan arkadyevitch you know he he ’ get a place now on the committee of a commission and something or other i do not remember only there ’ nothing to do in it — why dolly it ’ no secret — and a salary of eight thousand you try ask he whether his post be of use he ’ll prove to you that it ’ most necessary and he ’ a truthful man too but there ’ no refuse to believe in the utility of eight thousand rouble   yes he ask i to give a message to darya alexandrovna about the post  say sergey ivanovitch reluctantly feel the prince ’s remark to be illtimed  so it be with the unanimity of the press that ’ be explain to i as soon as there ’ war their income be double how can they help believe in the destiny of the people and the slavonic race   and all that   i do not care for many of the paper but that ’ unjust  say sergey ivanovitch  i would only make one condition  pursue the old prince  alphonse karr say a capital thing before the war with prussia  you consider war to be inevitable very good let everyone who advocate war be enrol in a special regiment of advanceguard for the front of every storm of every attack to lead they all    a nice lot the editor would make  say katavasov with a loud roar as he picture the editor he know in this pick legion  but they ’d run  say dolly  they ’d only be in the way   oh if they run away then we ’d have grapeshot or cossack with whip behind they  say the prince  but that ’ a joke and a poor one too if you ’ll excuse my say so prince  say sergey ivanovitch  i do not see that it be a joke that  levin be begin but sergey ivanovitch interrupt he  every member of society be call upon to do his own special work  say he  and man of thought be do their work when they express public opinion and the singlehearted and full expression of public opinion be the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice we at the same time twenty year ago we should have be silent but now we have hear the voice of the russian people which be ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brother that be a great step and a proof of strength   but it ’ not only make a sacrifice but kill turk  say levin timidly  the people make sacrifice and be ready to make sacrifice for their soul but not for murder  he add instinctively connect the conversation with the idea that have be absorb his mind  for their soul that ’ a most puzzling expression for a natural science man do you understand what sort of thing be the soul  say katavasov smile  oh you know   no by god i have not the faint idea  say katavasov with a loud roar of laughter   i bring not peace but a sword  say christ  sergey ivanovitch rejoin for his part quote as simply as though it be the easy thing to understand the very passage that have always puzzle levin most  that ’ so no doubt  the old man repeat again he be stand near they and respond to a chance glance turn in his direction  ah my dear fellow you ’re defeat utterly defeated  cry katavasov goodhumoredly levin redden with vexation not at be defeat but at have fail to control himself and be draw into argument  no i can not argue with they  he think  they wear impenetrable armor while i ’m naked  he see that it be impossible to convince his brother and katavasov and he see even less possibility of himself agree with they what they advocate be the very pride of intellect that have almost be his ruin he could not admit that some dozen of man among they his brother have the right on the ground of what they be tell by some hundred of glib volunteer swarm to the capital to say that they and the newspaper be express the will and feeling of the people and a feeling which be express in vengeance and murder he could not admit this because he neither see the expression of such feeling in the people among whom he be live nor find they in himself and he could not but consider himself one of the person make up the russian people and most of all because he like the people do not know and could not know what be for the general good though he know beyond a doubt that this general good could be attain only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which have be reveal to every man and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general object whatever he say as mihalitch do and the people who have express their feeling in the traditional invitation of the varyagi  be prince and rule over we gladly we promise complete submission all the labor all humiliation all sacrifice we take upon ourselves but we will not judge and decide  and now accord to sergey ivanovitch ’s account the people have forego this privilege they have buy at such a costly price he want to say too that if public opinion be an infallible guide then why be not revolution and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the slavonic people but these be merely thought that could settle nothing one thing could be see beyond doubt — that be that at the actual moment the discussion be irritate sergey ivanovitch and so it be wrong to continue it and levin cease speak and then call the attention of his guest to the fact that the storm cloud be gather and that they have well be go home before it rain the old prince and sergey ivanovitch get into the trap and drive off the rest of the party hasten homewards on foot but the stormcloud turn white and then black move down so quickly that they have to quicken their pace to get home before the rain the foremost cloud lower and black as sootladen smoke rush with extraordinary swiftness over the sky they be still two hundred pace from home and a gust of wind have already blow up and every second the downpour might be look for the child run ahead with frightened and gleeful shriek darya alexandrovna struggle painfully with her skirt that cling round her leg be not walk but run her eye fix on the child the man of the party hold their hat on stride with long step beside she they be just at the step when a big drop fall splash on the edge of the iron guttering the child and their elder after they run into the shelter of the house talk merrily  katerina alexandrovna  levin ask of agafea mihalovna who meet they with kerchief and rug in the hall  we think she be with you  she say  and mitya   in the copse he must be and the nurse with he  levin snatch up the rug and run towards the copse in that brief interval of time the storm cloud have move on cover the sun so completely that it be dark as an eclipse stubbornly as though insist on its right the wind stop levin and tear the leave and flower off the lime tree and strip the white birch branch into strange unseemly nakedness it twist everything on one side — acacias flower burdock long grass and tall treetop the peasant girl work in the garden run shriek into shelter in the servant  quarter the stream rain have already fling its white veil over all the distant forest and half the field close by and be rapidly swoop down upon the copse the wet of the rain spurt up in tiny drop could be smell in the air hold his head bend down before he and struggle with the wind that strive to tear the wrap away from he levin be move up to the copse and have just catch sight of something white behind the oak tree when there be a sudden flash the whole earth seem on fire and the vault of heaven seem crash overhead open his blind eye levin gaze through the thick veil of rain that separate he now from the copse and to his horror the first thing he see be the green crest of the familiar oaktree in the middle of the copse uncannily change its position  can it have be strike  levin hardly have time to think when move more and more rapidly the oak tree vanish behind the other tree and he hear the crash of the great tree fall upon the other the flash of lightning the crash of thunder and the instantaneous chill that run through he be all merge for levin in one sense of terror  my god my god not on they  he say and though he think at once how senseless be his prayer that they should not have be kill by the oak which have fall now he repeat it know that he could do nothing well than utter this senseless prayer run up to the place where they usually go he do not find they there they be at the other end of the copse under an old limetree they be call he two figure in dark dress they have be light summer dress when they start out be stand bend over something it be kitty with the nurse the rain be already cease and it be begin to get light when levin reach they the nurse be not wet on the low part of her dress but kitty be drench through and her soaked clothe cling to she though the rain be over they still stand in the same position in which they have be stand when the storm break both stand bend over a perambulator with a green umbrella  alive unhurt thank god  he say splash with his soak boot through the stand water and run up to they kitty ’s rosy wet face be turn towards he and she smile timidly under her shapeless sop hat  be not you ashamed of yourself i can not think how you can be so reckless  he say angrily to his wife  it be not my fault really we be just mean to go when he make such a todo that we have to change he we be just  kitty begin defend herself mitya be unharmed dry and still fast asleep  well thank god i do not know what i ’m say  they gather up the baby ’s wet belonging the nurse pick up the baby and carry it levin walk beside his wife and penitent for have be angry he squeeze her hand when the nurse be not look during the whole of that day in the extremely different conversation in which he take part only as it be with the top layer of his mind in spite of the disappointment of not find the change he expect in himself levin have be all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his heart after the rain it be too wet to go for a walk besides the storm cloud still hang about the horizon and gather here and there black and thundery on the rim of the sky the whole party spend the rest of the day in the house no more discussion spring up on the contrary after dinner everyone be in the most amiable frame of mind at first katavasov amuse the lady by his original joke which always please people on their first acquaintance with he then sergey ivanovitch induce he to tell they about the very interesting observation he have make on the habit and characteristic of common housefly and their life sergey ivanovitch too be in good spirit and at tea his brother draw he on to explain his view of the future of the eastern question and he speak so simply and so well that everyone listen eagerly kitty be the only one who do not hear it all — she be summon to give mitya his bath a few minute after kitty have leave the room she send for levin to come to the nursery leave his tea and regretfully interrupt the interesting conversation and at the same time uneasily wonder why he have be send for as this only happen on important occasion levin go to the nursery although he have be much interested by sergey ivanovitch ’s view of the new epoch in history that would be create by the emancipation of forty million of man of slavonic race act with russia a conception quite new to he and although he be disturb by uneasy wonder at be send for by kitty as soon as he come out of the drawingroom and be alone his mind revert at once to the thought of the morning and all the theory of the significance of the slav element in the history of the world seem to he so trivial compare with what be pass in his own soul that he instantly forget it all and drop back into the same frame of mind that he have be in that morning he do not as he have do at other time recall the whole train of thought — that he do not need he fall back at once into the feeling which have guide he which be connect with those thought and he find that feeling in his soul even strong and more definite than before he do not as he have have to do with previous attempt to find comforting argument need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling now on the contrary the feeling of joy and peace be keen than ever and think could not keep pace with feeling he walk across the terrace and look at two star that have come out in the darken sky and suddenly he remember  yes look at the sky i think that the dome that i see be not a deception and then i think something i shirk face something  he muse  but whatever it be there can be no disprove it i have but to think and all will come clear  just as he be go into the nursery he remember what it be he have shirk face it be that if the chief proof of the divinity be his revelation of what be right how be it this revelation be confine to the christian church alone what relation to this revelation have the belief of the buddhists mohammedans who preach and do good too it seem to he that he have an answer to this question but he have not time to formulate it to himself before he go into the nursery kitty be stand with her sleeve tuck up over the baby in the bath hear her husband ’s footstep she turn towards he summon he to she with her smile with one hand she be support the fat baby that lie float and sprawl on its back while with the other she squeeze the sponge over he  come look look  she say when her husband come up to she  agafea mihalovna ’ right he know we  mitya have on that day give unmistakable incontestable sign of recognize all his friend as soon as levin approach the bath the experiment be try and it be completely successful the cook send for with this object bend over the baby he frown and shake his head disapprovingly kitty bend down to he he give she a beaming smile prop his little hand on the sponge and chirrup make such a queer little contented sound with his lip that kitty and the nurse be not alone in their admiration levin too be surprised and delighted   the baby be take out of the bath drench with water wrap in towel dry and after a piercing scream hand to his mother    well i be glad you be begin to love he  say kitty to her husband when she have settle herself comfortably in her usual place with the baby at her breast  i be so glad it have begin to distress i you say you have no feeling for he     no do i say that i only say i be disappointed     what disappoint in he     not disappointed in he but in my own feeling i have expect more i have expect a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise and then instead of that — disgust pity    she listen attentively look at he over the baby while she put back on her slender finger the ring she have take off while give mitya his bath    and most of all at there be far more apprehension and pity than pleasure today after that fright during the storm i understand how i love he    kitty ’s smile be radiant    be you very much frightened  she say  so be i too but i feel it more now that it ’ over i ’m go to look at the oak how nice katavasov be and what a happy day we ’ve have altogether and you ’re so nice with sergey ivanovitch when you care to be well go back to they it ’ always so hot and steamy here after the bath      go out of the nursery and be again alone levin go back at once to the thought in which there be something not clear   instead of go into the drawingroom where he hear voice he stop on the terrace and lean his elbow on the parapet he gaze up at the sky   it be quite dark now and in the south where he be look there be no cloud the storm have drift on to the opposite side of the sky and there be flash of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter levin listen to the monotonous drip from the lime tree in the garden and look at the triangle of star he know so well and the milky way with its branch that run through its midst at each flash of lightning the milky way and even the bright star vanish but as soon as the lightning die away they reappear in their place as though some hand have fling they back with careful aim    well what be it perplex i  levin say to himself feel beforehand that the solution of his difficulty be ready in his soul though he do not know it yet  yes the one unmistakable incontestable manifestation of the divinity be the law of right and wrong which have come into the world by revelation and which i feel in myself and in the recognition of which — i do not make myself but whether i will or not — i be make one with other man in one body of believer which be call the church well but the jews the mohammedans the confucians the buddhists — what of they  he put to himself the question he have fear to face  can these hundred of million of man be deprive of that high blessing without which life have no meaning  he ponder a moment but immediately correct himself  but what be i question  he say to himself  i be question the relation to divinity of all the different religion of all mankind i be question the universal manifestation of god to all the world with all those misty blur what be i about to i individually to my heart have be reveal a knowledge you all doubt and unattainable by reason and here i be obstinately try to express that knowledge in reason and word    do not i know that the star do not move  he ask himself gaze at the bright planet which have shift its position up to the topmost twig of the birchtree  but look at the movement of the star i can not picture to myself the rotation of the earth and i ’m right in say that the star move    and could the astronomer have understand and calculate anything if they have take into account all the complicated and varied motion of the earth all the marvelous conclusion they have reach about the distance weight movement and deflection of the heavenly body be only found on the apparent motion of the heavenly body about a stationary earth on that very motion i see before i now which have be so for million of man during long age and be and will be always alike and can always be trust and just as the conclusion of the astronomer would have be vain and uncertain if not found on observation of the seen heaven in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon so would my conclusion be vain and uncertain if not found on that conception of right which have be and will be always alike for all man which have be reveal to i as a christian and which can always be trust in my soul the question of other religion and their relation to divinity i have no right to decide and no possibility of decide     oh you have not go in then  he hear kitty ’s voice all at once as she come by the same way to the drawingroom    what be it you ’re not worried about anything  she say look intently at his face in the starlight   but she could not have see his face if a flash of lightning have not hide the star and reveal it in that flash she see his face distinctly and see he calm and happy she smile at he    she understand  he think  she know what i ’m think about shall i tell she or not yes i ’ll tell she  but at the moment he be about to speak she begin speak    kostya do something for i  she say  go into the corner room and see if they ’ve make it all right for sergey ivanovitch i can not very well see if they ’ve put the new wash stand in it     very well i ’ll go directly  say levin stand up and kiss she    no i ’d well not speak of it  he think when she have go in before he  it be a secret for i alone of vital importance for i and not to be put into word    this new feeling have not change i have not make i happy and enlightened all of a sudden as i have dream just like the feeling for my child there be no surprise in this either faith — or not faith — i do not know what it be — but this feeling have come just as imperceptibly through suffering and have take firm root in my soul    i shall go on in the same way lose my temper with ivan the coachman fall into angry discussion express my opinion tactlessly there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people even my wife i shall still go on scold she for my own terror and be remorseful for it i shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why i pray and i shall still go on pray but my life now my whole life apart from anything that can happen to i every minute of it be no more meaningless as it be before but it have the positive meaning of goodness which i have the power to put into it
