the step of the terrace  what ’ that you do not want to think about  inquire levin come onto the terrace but no one answer he and he do not repeat the question  i ’m sorry i ’ve break in on your feminine parliament  he say look round on everyone discontentedly and perceive that they have be talk of something which they would not talk about before he for a second he feel that he be share the feeling of agafea mihalovna vexation at their make jam without water and altogether at the outside shtcherbatsky element he smile however and go up to kitty  well how be you  he ask she look at she with the expression with which everyone look at she now  oh very well  say kitty smile  and how have thing go with you   the wagon hold three time as much as the old cart do well be we go for the child i ’ve order the horse to be put in   what you want to take kitty in the wagonette  her mother say reproachfully  yes at a walk pace princess  levin never call the princess  maman  as man often do call their mothersinlaw and the princess dislike his not do so but though he like and respect the princess levin could not call she so without a sense of profane his feeling for his dead mother  come with we maman  say kitty  i do not like to see such imprudence   well i ’ll walk then i ’m so well  kitty get up and go to her husband and take his hand  you may be well but everything in moderation  say the princess  well agafea mihalovna be the jam do  say levin smile to agafea mihalovna and try to cheer she up  be it all right in the new way   i suppose it ’ all right for our notion it ’ boil too long   it ’ll be all the well agafea mihalovna it will not mildew even though our ice have begin to thaw already so that we ’ve no cool cellar to store it  say kitty at once divine her husband ’s motive and address the old housekeeper with the same feeling  but your pickle ’ so good that mamma say she never taste any like it  she add smile and put her kerchief straight agafea mihalovna look angrily at kitty  you need not try to console i mistress i need only to look at you with he and i feel happy  she say and something in the rough familiarity of that with he touch kitty  come along with we to look for mushroom you will show we the good place  agafea mihalovna smile and shake her head as though to say  i should like to be angry with you too but i can n’t   do it please by my receipt  say the princess  put some paper over the jam and moisten it with a little rum and without even ice it will never go mildewy  kitty be particularly glad of a chance of be alone with her husband for she have notice the shade of mortification that have pass over his face — always so quick to reflect every feeling — at the moment when he have come onto the terrace and ask what they be talk of and have get no answer when they have set off on foot ahead of the other and have come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road mark with rusty wheel and sprinkle with grain of corn she cling fast to his arm and press it close to she he have quite forget the momentary unpleasant impression and alone with she he feel now that the thought of she approach motherhood be never for a moment absent from his mind a new and delicious bliss quite pure from all alloy of sense in the being near to the woman he love there be no need of speech yet he long to hear the sound of her voice which like her eye have change since she have be with child in her voice as in her eye there be that softness and gravity which be find in people continually concentrate on some cherish pursuit  so you ’re not tired lean more on i  say he  no i ’m so glad of a chance of be alone with you and i must own though i ’m happy with they i do regret our winter evening alone   that be good but this be even well both be well  he say squeeze her hand  do you know what we be talk about when you come in   about jam   oh yes about jam too but afterwards about how man make offer   ah  say levin listen more to the sound of her voice than to the word she be say and all the while pay attention to the road which pass now through the forest and avoid place where she might make a false step  and about sergey ivanovitch and varenka you ’ve notice i ’m very anxious for it  she go on  what do you think about it  and she peep into his face  i do not know what to think  levin answer smile  sergey seem very strange to i in that way i tell you you know   yes that he be in love with that girl who die   that be when i be a child i know about it from hearsay and tradition i remember he then he be wonderfully sweet but i ’ve watch he since with woman he be friendly some of they he like but one feel that to he they ’re simply people not woman   yes but now with varenka   i fancy there ’ something   perhaps there be but one have to know he he ’ a peculiar wonderful person he live a spiritual life only he ’ too pure too exalted a nature   why would this lower he then   no but he ’ so used to a spiritual life that he can not reconcile himself with actual fact and varenka be after all fact  levin have grow used by now to utter his thought boldly without take the trouble of clothe it in exact language he know that his wife in such moment of loving tenderness as now would understand what he mean to say from a hint and she do understand he  yes but there ’ not so much of that actual fact about she as about i i can see that he would never have care for i she be altogether spiritual   oh no he be so fond of you and i be always so glad when my people like you   yes he ’ very nice to i but   it ’ not as it be with poor nikolay   you really care for each other  levin finish  why not speak of he  he add  i sometimes blame myself for not it end in one ’s forget ah how terrible and dear he be yes what be we talk about  levin say after a pause  you think he can not fall in love  say kitty translate into her own language  it ’ not so much that he can not fall in love  levin say smile  but he have not the weakness necessary i ’ve always envy he and even now when i ’m so happy i still envy he   you envy he for not be able to fall in love   i envy he for be well than i  say levin  he do not live for himself his whole life be subordinate to his duty and that ’ why he can be calm and contented   and you  kitty ask with an ironical and loving smile she could never have explain the chain of thought that make she smile but the last link in it be that her husband in exalt his brother and abase himself be not quite sincere kitty know that this insincerity come from his love for his brother from his sense of shame at be too happy and above all from his unflagging craving to be well — she love it in he and so she smile  and you what be you dissatisfied with  she ask with the same smile her disbelief in his selfdissatisfaction delight he and unconsciously he try to draw she into give utterance to the ground of her disbelief  i be happy but dissatisfied with myself  he say  why how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you be happy   well how shall i say in my heart i really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble — see oh but really you must not skip about like that  he cry break off to scold she for too agile a movement in step over a branch that lie in the path  but when i think about myself and compare myself with other especially with my brother i feel i ’m a poor creature   but in what way  kitty pursue with the same smile  do not you too work for other what about your cooperative settlement and your work on the estate and your book   oh but i feel and particularly just now — it ’ your fault  he say press her hand—“that all that do not count i do it in a way halfheartedly if i could care for all that as i care for you instead of that i do it in these day like a task that be set i   well what would you say about papa  ask kitty  be he a poor creature then as he do nothing for the public good   he — no but then one must have the simplicity the straightforwardness the goodness of your father and i have not get that i do nothing and i fret about it it ’ all your doing before there be you — and this too  he add with a glance towards her waist that she understood—“i put all my energy into work now i can n’t and i ’m ashamed i do it just as though it be a task set i i ’m pretend   well but would you like to change this minute with sergey ivanovitch  say kitty  would you like to do this work for the general good and to love the task set you as he do and nothing else   of course not  say levin  but i ’m so happy that i do not understand anything so you think he ’ll make she an offer today  he add after a brief silence  i think so and i do not think so only i ’m awfully anxious for it here wait a minute  she stoop down and pick a wild camomile at the edge of the path  come count he do propose he do not  she say give he the flower  he do he do not  say levin tear off the white petal  no no  kitty snatch at his hand stop he she have be watch his finger with interest  you pick off two   oh but see this little one shall not count to make up  say levin tear off a little halfgrown petal  here ’ the wagonette overtake we   be not you tired kitty  call the princess  not in the least   if you be you can get in as the horse be quiet and walk  but it be not worth while to get in they be quite near the place and all walk on together varenka with her white kerchief on her black hair surround by the child gaily and goodhumoredly look after they and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receive a declaration from the man she care for be very attractive sergey ivanovitch walk beside she and never leave off admire she look at she he recall all the delightful thing he have hear from her lip all the good he know about she and become more and more conscious that the feeling he have for she be something special that he have feel long long ago and only once in his early youth the feeling of happiness in be near she continually grow and at last reach such a point that as he put a huge slenderstalked agaric fungus in her basket he look straight into her face and notice the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face he be confuse himself and smile to she in silence a smile that say too much  if so  he say to himself  i ought to think it over and make up my mind and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment   i ’m go to pick by myself apart from all the rest or else my effort will make no show  he say and he leave the edge of the forest where they be walk on low silky grass between old birch tree stand far apart and go more into the heart of the wood where between the white birch trunk there be gray trunk of aspen and dark bush of hazel walk some forty pace away sergey ivanovitch know he be out of sight stand still behind a bushy spindletree in full flower with its rosy red catkin it be perfectly still all round he only overhead in the birch under which he stand the fly like a swarm of bee buzz unceasingly and from time to time the child ’s voice be float across to he all at once he hear not far from the edge of the wood the sound of varenka ’s contralto voice call grisha and a smile of delight pass over sergey ivanovitch ’s face conscious of this smile he shake his head disapprovingly at his own condition and take out a cigar he begin light it for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree the soft scale of the white bark rub off the phosphorus and the light go out at last one of the match burn and the fragrant cigar smoke hover uncertainly in flat wide coil stretch away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhang branch of a birch tree watch the streak of smoke sergey ivanovitch walk gently on deliberate on his position  why not  he think  if it be only a passing fancy or a passion if it be only this attraction — this mutual attraction i can call it a mutual attraction but if i feel that it be in contradiction with the whole bent of my life — if i feel that in give way to this attraction i should be false to my vocation and my duty   but it ’ not so the only thing i can say against it be that when i lose marie i say to myself that i would remain faithful to her memory that ’ the only thing i can say against my feeling that ’ a great thing  sergey ivanovitch say to himself feel at the same time that this consideration have not the slight importance for he personally but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eye of other  but apart from that however much i search i should never find anything to say against my feeling if i be choose by consideration of suitability alone i could not have find anything well  however many woman and girl he think of whom he know he could not think of a girl who unite to such a degree all you all the quality he would wish to see in his wife she have all the charm and freshness of youth but she be not a child and if she love he she love he consciously as a woman ought to love that be one thing another point she be not only far from be worldly but have an unmistakable distaste for worldly society and at the same time she know the world and have all the way of a woman of the good society which be absolutely essential to sergey ivanovitch ’s conception of the woman who be to share his life thirdly she be religious and not like a child unconsciously religious and good as kitty for example be but her life be found on religious principle even in trifling matter sergey ivanovitch find in she all that he want in his wife she be poor and alone in the world so she would not bring with she a mass of relation and their influence into her husband ’s house as he see now in kitty ’s case she would owe everything to her husband which be what he have always desire too for his future family life and this girl who unite all these quality love he he be a modest man but he could not help see it and he love she there be one consideration against it — his age but he come of a longlived family he have not a single gray hair no one would have take he for forty and he remember varenka ’s say that it be only in russia that man of fifty think themselves old and that in france a man of fifty consider himself dans la force de l’âge while a man of forty be un jeune homme but what do the mere reckoning of year matter when he feel as young in heart as he have be twenty year ago be it not youth to feel as he feel now when come from the other side to the edge of the wood he see in the glow light of the slant sunbeam the gracious figure of varenka in her yellow gown with her basket walk lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree and when this impression of the sight of varenka blend so harmoniously with the beauty of the view of the yellow oatfield lie bathe in the slant sunshine and beyond it the distant ancient forest fleck with yellow and melt into the blue of the distance his heart throb joyously a softened feeling come over he he feel that he have make up his mind varenka who have just crouch down to pick a mushroom rose with a supple movement and look round fling away the cigar sergey ivanovitch advance with resolute step towards she  varvara andreevna when i be very young i set before myself the ideal of the woman i love and should be happy to call my wife i have live through a long life and now for the first time i have meet what i seek — in you i love you and offer you my hand  sergey ivanovitch be say this to himself while he be ten pace from varvara kneel down with her hand over the mushroom to guard they from grisha she be call little masha  come here little one there be so many  she be say in her sweet deep voice see sergey ivanovitch approach she do not get up and do not change her position but everything tell he that she feel his presence and be glad of it  well do you find some  she ask from under the white kerchief turn her handsome gently smile face to he  not one  say sergey ivanovitch  do you  she do not answer busy with the child who throng about she  that one too near the twig  she point out to little masha a little fungus split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself varenka get up while masha pick the fungus break it into two white half  this bring back my childhood  she add move apart from the child beside sergey ivanovitch they walk on for some step in silence varenka see that he want to speak she guess of what and feel faint with joy and panic they have walk so far away that no one could hear they now but still he do not begin to speak it would have be well for varenka to be silent after a silence it would have be easy for they to say what they want to say than after talk about mushroom but against her own will as it be accidentally varenka say  so you find nothing in the middle of the wood there be always few though  sergey ivanovitch sigh and make no answer he be annoyed that she have speak about the mushroom he want to bring she back to the first word she have utter about her childhood but after a pause of some length as though against his own will he make an observation in response to her last word  i have hear that the white edible fungus be find principally at the edge of the wood though i can not tell they apart  some minute more pass they move still far away from the child and be quite alone varenka ’s heart throb so that she hear it beat and feel that she be turn red and pale and red again to be the wife of a man like koznishev after her position with madame stahl be to her imagination the height of happiness besides she be almost certain that she be in love with he and this moment it would have to be decide she feel frightened she dread both his speak and his not speak now or never it must be say — that sergey ivanovitch feel too everything in the expression the flushed cheek and the downcast eye of varenka betray a painful suspense sergey ivanovitch see it and feel sorry for she he feel even that to say nothing now would be a slight to she rapidly in his own mind he run over all the argument in support of his decision he even say over to himself the word in which he mean to put his offer but instead of those word some utterly unexpected reflection that occur to he make he ask  what be the difference between the  birch  mushroom and the  white  mushroom  varenka ’s lip quiver with emotion as she answer  in the top part there be scarcely any difference it ’ in the stalk  and as soon as these word be utter both he and she feel that it be over that what be to have be say would not be say and their emotion which have up to then be continually grow more intense begin to subside  the birch mushroom ’s stalk suggest a dark man ’s chin after two day without shave  say sergey ivanovitch speak quite calmly now  yes that ’ true  answer varenka smile and unconsciously the direction of their walk change they begin to turn towards the child varenka feel both sore and ashamed at the same time she have a sense of relief when he have get home again and go over the whole subject sergey ivanovitch think his previous decision have be a mistaken one he could not be false to the memory of marie  gently child gently  levin shout quite angrily to the child stand before his wife to protect she when the crowd of child fly with shriek of delight to meet they behind the child sergey ivanovitch and varenka walk out of the wood kitty have no need to ask varenka she see from the calm and somewhat crestfallen face of both that her plan have not come off  well  her husband question she as they be go home again  it do not bite  say kitty her smile and manner of speak recall her father a likeness levin often notice with pleasure  how do not bite   i ’ll show you  she say take her husband ’s hand lift it to her mouth and just faintly brush it with closed lip  like a kiss on a priest ’s hand   which do not it bite with  he say laugh  both but it should have be like this   there be some peasant come   oh they do not see  during the time of the child ’s tea the grownup people sit in the balcony and talk as though nothing have happen though you all especially sergey ivanovitch and varenka be very well aware that there have happen an event which though negative be of very great importance they both have the same feeling rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination which have leave he in the same class or shut he out of the school forever everyone present feel too that something have happen talk eagerly about extraneous subject levin and kitty be particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening and their happiness in their love seem to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have like to feel the same and could not — and they feel a prick of conscience  mark my word alexander will not come  say the old princess that evening they be expect stepan arkadyevitch to come down by train and the old prince have write that possibly he might come too  and i know why  the princess go on  he say that young people ought to be leave alone for a while at first   but papa have leave we alone we ’ve never see he  say kitty  besides we ’re not young people — we’re old married people by now   only if he do not come i shall say goodbye to you child  say the princess sigh mournfully  what nonsense mamma  both the daughter fall upon she at once  how do you suppose he be feel why now  and suddenly there be an unexpected quiver in the princess ’s voice her daughter be silent and look at one another  maman always find something to be miserable about  they say in that glance they do not know that happy as the princess be in her daughter ’s

imply in they at the very bottom of her heart she do think there have be something precisely at the moment when he have cross over after she to the other end of the table but she dare not own it even to herself and would have be even more unable to bring herself to say so to he and so increase his suffering  and what can there possibly be attractive about i as i be now   ah  he cry clutch at his

and a trap for the shooting party be at the door and laska aware since early morning that they be go shoot after much whining and darting to and fro have sit herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman and disapprove of the delay be excitedly watch the door from which the sportsman still do not come out the first to come out be vassenka veslovsky in new high boot that reach halfway up his thick thigh in a green blouse with a new russian leather cartridgebelt and in his scotch cap with ribbon with a brandnew english gun without a sling laska fly up to he welcome he and jump up ask he in her own way whether the other be come soon but get no answer from he she return to her post of observation and sink into repose again her head on one side and one ear prick up to listen at last the door open with a creak and stepan arkadyevitch ’s spotandtan pointer krak fly out run round and round and turn over in the air stepan arkadyevitch himself follow with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth  good dog good dog krak  he cry encouragingly to the dog who put his paw up on his chest catch at his game bag stepan arkadyevitch be dress in rough legging and spat in torn trouser and a short coat on his head there be a wreck of a hat of indefinite form but his gun of a new patent be a perfect gem and his game bag and cartridge belt though wear be of the very good quality vassenka veslovsky have have no notion before that it be truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatter but to have his shooting outfit of the good quality he see it now as he look at stepan arkadyevitch radiant in his rag graceful wellfed and joyous a typical russian nobleman and he make up his mind that next time he go shoot he would certainly adopt the same getup  well and what about our host  he ask  a young wife  say stepan arkadyevitch smile  yes and such a charming one   he come down dressed no doubt he ’ run up to she again  stepan arkadyevitch guess right levin have run up again to his wife to ask she once more if she forgive he for his idiocy yesterday and moreover to beg she for christ ’s sake to be more careful the great thing be for she to keep away from the child — they might any minute push against she then he have once more to hear she declare that she be not angry with he for go away for two day and to beg she to be sure to send he a note next morning by a servant on horseback to write he if it be but two word only to let he know that all be well with her kitty be distressed as she always be at part for a couple of day from her husband but when she see his eager figure look big and strong in his shootingboot and his white blouse and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to she she forget her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure and say goodbye to he cheerfully  pardon gentleman  he say run out onto the step  have you put the lunch in why be the chestnut on the right well it do not matter laska down go and lie down   put it with the herd of oxen  he say to the herdsman who be wait for he at the step with some question  excuse i here come another villain  levin jump out of the wagonette in which he have already take his seat to meet the carpenter who come towards the step with a rule in his hand  you do not come to the counting house yesterday and now you ’re detain i well what be it   would your honor let i make another turning it ’ only three step to add and we make it just fit at the same time it will be much more convenient   you should have listen to i  levin answer with annoyance  i say put the line and then fit in the step now there ’ no set it right do as i tell you and make a new staircase  the point be that in the lodge that be be build the carpenter have spoil the staircase fit it together without calculate the space it be to fill so that the step be all slope when it be put in place now the carpenter want keep the same staircase to add three step  it will be much well   but where ’ your staircase come out with its three step   why upon my word sir  the carpenter say with a contemptuous smile  it come out right at the very spot it start so to speak  he say with a persuasive gesture  it come down and come down and come out   but three step will add to the length too   where be it to come out   why to be sure it ’ll start from the bottom and go up and go up and come out so  the carpenter say obstinately and convincingly  it ’ll reach the ceiling and the wall   upon my word why it ’ll go up and up and come out like this  levin take out a ramrod and begin sketch he the staircase in the dust  there do you see   as your honor like  say the carpenter with a sudden gleam in his eye obviously understand the thing at last  it seem it ’ll be good to make a new one   well then do it as you ’re tell  levin shout seat himself in the wagonette  down hold the dog philip  levin feel now at leave behind all his family and household care such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he be not disposed to talk besides that he have that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experience as he approach the scene of action if he have anything on his mind at that moment it be only the doubt whether they would start anything in the kolpensky marsh whether laska would show to advantage in comparison with krak and whether he would shoot well that day himself not to disgrace himself before a new spectator — not to be outdo by oblonsky — that too be a thought that cross his brain oblonsky be feel the same and he too be not talkative vassenka veslovsky keep up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter as he listen to he now levin feel ashamed to think how unfair he have be to he the day before vassenka be really a nice fellow simple goodhearted and very goodhumored if levin have meet he before he be marry he would have make friend with he levin rather dislike his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance it be as though he assume a high degree of importance in himself that could not be dispute because he have long nail and a stylish cap and everything else to correspond but this could be forgive for the sake of his good nature and good breeding levin like he for his good education for speak french and english with such an excellent accent and for be a man of his world vassenka be extremely delighted with the left horse a horse of the don steppes he keep praise he enthusiastically  how fine it must be gallop over the steppes on a steppe horse eh be not it  he say he have imagine ride on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic and it turn out nothing of the sort but his simplicity particularly in conjunction with his good look his amiable smile and the grace of his movement be very attractive either because his nature be sympathetic to levin or because levin be try to atone for his sin of the previous evening by see nothing but what be good in he anyway he like his society after they have drive over two mile from home you all at once feel for a cigar and his pocketbook and do not know whether he have lose they or leave they on the table in the pocketbook there be thirtyseven pound and so the matter could not be leave in uncertainty  do you know what levin i ’ll gallop home on that left tracehorse that will be splendid eh  he say prepare to get out  no why should you  answer levin calculate that vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone  i ’ll send the coachman  the coachman ride back on the tracehorse and levin himself drive the remain pair  well now what ’ our plan of campaign tell we all about it  say stepan arkadyevitch  our plan be this now we ’re drive to gvozdyov in gvozdyov there ’ a grouse marsh on this side and beyond gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marsh where there be grouse too it ’ hot now and we ’ll get there — it ’ fifteen mile or so — towards evening and have some evening shooting we ’ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the big moor   and be there nothing on the way   yes but we ’ll reserve ourselves besides it ’ hot there be two nice little place but i doubt there be anything to shoot  levin would himself have like to go into these little place but they be near home he could shoot they over any time and they be only little place — there would hardly be room for three to shoot and so with some insincerity he say that he doubt there be anything to shoot when they reach a little marsh levin would have drive by but stepan arkadyevitch with the experienced eye of a sportsman at once detect reed visible from the road  sha not we try that  he say point to the little marsh  levin do please how delightful  vassenka veslovsky begin beg and levin could but consent before they have time to stop the dog have fly one before the other into the marsh  krak laska  the dog come back  there will not be room for three i ’ll stay here  say levin hope they would find nothing but peewit who have be startle by the dog and turn over in their flight be plaintively wail over the marsh  no come along levin let ’s go together  veslovsky call  really there ’ not room laska back laska you will not want another dog will you  levin remain with the wagonette and look enviously at the sportsman they walk right across the marsh except little bird and peewit of which vassenka kill one there be nothing in the marsh  come you see now that it be not that i grudge the marsh  say levin  only it ’ waste time   oh no it be you all the same do you see we  say vassenka veslovsky clamber awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hand  how splendidly i shoot this bird do not i well shall we soon be get to the real place  the horse start off suddenly levin knock his head against the stock of someone ’s gun and there be the report of a shot the gun do actually go off first but that be how it seem to levin it appear that vassenka veslovsky have pull only one trigger and have leave the other hammer still cock the charge fly into the ground without do harm to anyone stepan arkadyevitch shake his head and laugh reprovingly at veslovsky but levin have not the heart to reprove he in the first place any reproach would have seem to be call forth by the danger he have incur and the bump that have come up on levin ’s forehead and besides veslovsky be at first so naïvely distressed and then laugh so goodhumoredly and infectiously at their general dismay that one could not but laugh with he when they reach the second marsh which be fairly large and would inevitably take some time to shoot over levin try to persuade they to pass it by but veslovsky again overpersuade he again as the marsh be narrow levin like a good host remain with the carriage krak make straight for some clump of sedge vassenka veslovsky be the first to run after the dog before stepan arkadyevitch have time to come up a grouse fly out veslovsky miss it and it fly into an unmown meadow this grouse be leave for veslovsky to follow up krak find it again and point and veslovsky shoot it and go back to the carriage  now you go and i ’ll stay with the horse  he say levin have begin to feel the pang of a sportsman ’s envy he hand the rein to veslovsky and walk into the marsh laska who have be plaintively whine and fret against the injustice of her treatment fly straight ahead to a hopeful place that levin know well and that krak have not yet come upon  why do n’t you stop she  shout stepan arkadyevitch  she will not scare they  answer levin sympathize with his bitch ’s pleasure and hurry after she as she come near and near to the familiar breeding place there be more and more earnestness in laska ’s exploration a little marsh bird do not divert her attention for more than an instant she make one circuit round the clump of reed be begin a second and suddenly quiver with excitement and become motionless  come come stiva  shout levin feel his heart begin to beat more violently and all of a sudden as though some sort of shutter have be draw back from his strain ear all sound confused but loud begin to beat on his hear lose all sense of distance he hear the step of stepan arkadyevitch mistake they for the tramp of the horse in the distance he hear the brittle sound of the twig on which he have tread take this sound for the flying of a grouse he hear too not far behind he a splashing in the water which he could not explain to himself pick his step he move up to the dog  fetch it  not a grouse but a snipe fly up from beside the dog levin have lift his gun but at the very instant when he be take aim the sound of splashing grow louder come close and be join with the sound of veslovsky ’s voice shout something with strange loudness levin see he have his gun point behind the snipe but still he fire when he have make sure he have miss levin look round and see the horse and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh veslovsky eager to see the shooting have drive into the marsh and get the horse stick in the mud  damn the fellow  levin say to himself as he go back to the carriage that have sink in the mire  what do you drive in for  he say to he dryly and call the coachman he begin pull the horse out levin be vex both at be hinder from shoot and at his horse get stick in the mud and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevitch nor veslovsky help he and the coachman to unharness the horse and get they out since neither of they have the slight notion of harnessing without vouchsafe a syllable in reply to vassenka ’s protestation that it have be quite dry there levin work in silence with the coachman at extricate the horse but then as he get warm at the work and see how assiduously veslovsky be tug at the wagonette by one of the mudguard so that he break it indeed levin blame himself for have under the influence of yesterday ’s feeling be too cold to veslovsky and try to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness when everything have be put right and the carriage have be bring back to the road levin have the lunch serve  bon appétit — bonne conscience ce poulet va tomber jusqu’au fond de mes bottes  vassenka who have recover his spirit quote the french say as he finish his second chicken  well now our trouble be over now everything ’ go to go well only to atone for my sin i ’m bind to sit on the box that ’ so eh no no i ’ll be your automedon you shall see how i ’ll get you along  he answer not let go the rein when levin beg he to let the coachman drive  no i must atone for my sin and i ’m very comfortable on the box  and he drive levin be a little afraid he would exhaust the horse especially the chestnut whom he do not know how to hold in but unconsciously he fall under the influence of his gaiety and listen to the song he sing all the way on the box or the description and representation he give of drive in the english fashion fourinhand and it be in the very good of spirit that after lunch they drive to the gvozdyov marsh vassenka drive the horse so smartly that they reach the marsh too early while it be still hot as they draw near this more important marsh the chief aim of their expedition levin could not help consider how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movement stepan arkadyevitch evidently have the same desire and on his face levin see the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when begin shoot together with a certain goodhumored slyness peculiar to he  how shall we go it ’ a splendid marsh i see and there be hawk  say stepan arkadyevitch point to two great bird hover over the reed  where there be hawk there be sure to be game   now gentleman  say levin pull up his boot and examine the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression  do you see those reed  he point to an oasis of blackish green in the huge halfmown wet meadow that stretch along the right bank of the river  the marsh begin here straight in front of we do you see — where it be green from here it run to the right where the horse be there be breeding place there and grouse and all round those reed as far as that alder and right up to the mill over there do you see where the pool be that ’ the good place there i once shoot seventeen snipe we ’ll separate with the dog and go in different direction and then meet over there at the mill   well which shall go to left and which to right  ask stepan arkadyevitch  it ’ wide to the right you two go that way and i ’ll take the left  he say with apparent carelessness  capital we ’ll make the big bag yes come along come along  vassenka exclaim levin could do nothing but agree and they divide as soon as they enter the marsh the two dog begin hunt about together and make towards the green slimecovered pool levin know laska ’s method wary and indefinite he know the place too and expect a whole covey of snipe  veslovsky beside i walk beside i  he say in a faint voice to his companion splash in the water behind he levin could not help feel an interest in the direction his gun be point after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh  oh i will not get in your way do not trouble about i  but levin could not help trouble and recall kitty ’s word at parting  mind you do not shoot one another  the dog come near and near pass each other each pursue its own scent the expectation of snipe be so intense that to levin the squelch sound of his own heel as he draw it up out of the mire seem to be the call of a snipe and he clutch and press the lock of his gun  bang bang  sound almost in his ear vassenka have fire at a flock of duck which be hover over the marsh and fly at that moment towards the sportsman far out of range before levin have time to look round there be the whir of one snipe another a third and some eight more rise one after another stepan arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it be begin its zigzag movement and the snipe fall in a heap into the mud oblonsky aim deliberately at another still fly low in the reed and together with the report of the shot that snipe too fall and it could be see flutter out where the sedge have be cut its unhurt wing show white beneath levin be not so lucky he aim at his first bird too low and miss he aim at it again just as it be rise but at that instant another snipe fly up at his very foot distract he so that he miss again while they be load their gun another snipe rise and veslovsky who have have time to load again send two charge of smallshot into the water stepan arkadyevitch pick up his snipe and with sparkling eye look at levin  well now let we separate  say stepan arkadyevitch and limp on his left foot hold his gun in readiness and whistle to his dog he walk off in one direction levin and veslovsky walk in the other it always happen with levin that when his first shot be a failure he get hot and out of temper and shoot badly the whole day so it be that day the snipe show themselves in number they keep fly up from just under the dog from under the sportsman ’s leg and levin might have retrieve his ill luck but the more he shoot the more he feel disgraced in the eye of veslovsky who keep pop away merrily and indiscriminately kill nothing and not in the slight abash by his ill success levin in feverish haste could not restrain himself get more and more out of temper and end by shoot almost without a hope of hit laska indeed seem to understand this she begin look more languidly and gaze back at the sportsman as it be with perplexity or reproach in her eye shot follow shot in rapid succession the smoke of the powder hang about the sportsman while in the great roomy net of the game bag there be only three light little snipe and of these one have be kill by veslovsky alone and one by both of they together meanwhile from the other side of the marsh come the sound of stepan arkadyevitch ’s shot not frequent but as levin fancy welldirected for almost after each they hear  krak krak apporte  this excite levin still more the snipe be float continually in the air over the reed their whir wing close to the earth and their harsh cry high in the air could be hear on all side the snipe that have rise first and fly up into the air settle again before the sportsman instead of two hawk there be now dozen of they hover with shrill cry over the marsh after walk through the large half of the marsh levin and veslovsky reach the place where the peasant  mowinggrass be divide into long strip reach to the reed mark off in one place by the trample grass in another by a path mow through it half of these strip have already be mow though there be not so much hope of find bird in the uncut part as the cut part levin have promise stepan arkadyevitch to meet he and so he walk on with his companion through the cut and uncut patch  hi sportsman  shout one of a group of peasant sit on an unharnessed cart  come and have some lunch with we have a drop of wine  levin look round  come along it ’ all right  shout a goodhumoredlooking bearded peasant with a red face show his white tooth in a grin and hold up a greenish bottle that flash in the sunlight  qu’estce qu’ils disent  ask veslovsky  they invite you to have some vodka most likely they ’ve be divide the meadow into lot i should have some  say levin not without some guile hope veslovsky would be tempt by the vodka and would go away to they  why do they offer it   oh they ’re merrymake really you should join they you would be interested   allons c’est curieux   you go you go you ’ll find the way to the mill  cry levin and look round he perceive with satisfaction that veslovsky bend and stumble with weariness hold his gun out at arm ’s length be make his way out of the marsh towards the peasant  you come too  the peasant shout to levin  never fear you taste our cake  levin feel a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread he be exhausted and feel it a great effort to drag his stagger leg out of the mire and for a minute he hesitate but laska be set and you all his weariness vanish and he walk lightly through the swamp towards the dog a snipe fly up at his foot he fire and kill it laska still pointed—“fetch it  another bird fly up close to the dog levin fire but it be an unlucky day for he he miss it and when he go to look for the one he have shoot he could not find that either he wander all about the reed but laska do not believe he have shoot it and when he send she to find it she pretend to hunt for it but do not really and in the absence of vassenka on whom levin throw the blame of his failure thing go no well there be plenty of snipe still but levin make one miss after another the slant ray of the sun be still hot his clothe soak through with perspiration stick to his body his left boot full of water weigh heavily on his leg and squeak at every step the sweat run in drop down his powdergrimed face his mouth be full of the bitter taste his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water his ear be ring with the incessant whir of the snipe he could not touch the stock of his gun it be so hot his heart beat with short rapid throb his hand shake with excitement and his weary leg stumble and stagger over the hillock and in the swamp but still he walk on and still he shoot at last after a disgraceful miss he flung his gun and his hat on the ground  no i must control myself  he say to himself pick up his gun and his hat he call laska and go out of the swamp when he get on to dry ground he sit down pull off his boot and empty it then walk to the marsh drink some stagnanttasting water moisten his burn hot gun and wash his face and hand feel refreshed he go back to the spot where a snipe have settle firmly resolve to keep cool he try to be calm but it be the same again his finger press the cock before he have take a good aim at the bird it get bad and bad he have only five bird in his gamebag when he walk out of the marsh towards the alders where he be to rejoin stepan arkadyevitch before he catch sight of stepan arkadyevitch he see his dog krak dart out from behind the twisted root of an alder black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh and with the air of a conqueror sniff at laska behind krak there come into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of stepan arkadyevitch he come to meet he red and perspire with unbuttoned neckband still limp in the same way  well you have be pop away  he say smile goodhumoredly  how have you get on  query levin but there be no need to ask for he have already see the full game bag  oh pretty fair  he have fourteen bird  a splendid marsh i ’ve no doubt veslovsky get in your way it ’ awkward too shoot with one dog  say stepan arkadyevitch to soften his triumph when levin and stepan arkadyevitch reach the peasant ’s hut where levin always use to stay veslovsky be already there he be sit in the middle of the hut cling with both hand to the bench from which he be be pull by a soldier the brother of the peasant ’s wife who be help he off with his miry boot veslovsky be laugh his infectious goodhumored laugh  i ’ve only just come ils ont été charmants just fancy they give i drink feed i such bread it be exquisite délicieux and the vodka i never taste any well and they would not take a penny for anything and they keep say  excuse our homely way    what should they take anything for they be entertain you to be sure do you suppose they keep vodka for sale  say the soldier succeed at last in pull the soak boot off the blacken stocking in spite of the dirtiness of the hut which be all muddy by their boot and the filthy dog lick themselves clean and the smell of marsh mud and powder that fill the room and the absence of knife and fork the party drink their tea and eat their supper with a relish only know to sportsman wash and clean they go into a haybarn sweep ready for they where the coachman have be make up bed for the gentleman though it be dusk not one of they want to go to sleep after waver among reminiscence and anecdote of gun of dog and of former shooting party the conversation rest on a topic that interest all of they after vassenka have several time over express his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay this delightful broken cart he suppose it to be break because the shaft have be take out of the good nature of the peasant that have treat he to vodka of the dog who lie at the foot of their respective master oblonsky begin tell they of a delightful shooting party at malthus ’s where he have stay the previous summer malthus be a wellknown capitalist who have make his money by speculation in railway share stepan arkadyevitch describe what grouse moor this malthus have buy in the tver province and how they be preserve and of the carriage and dogcart in which the shooting party have be drive and the luncheon pavilion that have be rig up at the marsh  i do not understand you  say levin sit up in the hay  how be it such people do not disgust you i can understand a lunch with lafitte be all very pleasant but do not you dislike just that very sumptuousness all these people just like our spirit monopolist in old day get their money in a way that gain they the contempt of everyone they do not care for their contempt and then they use their dishonest gain to buy off the contempt they have deserve   perfectly true  chime in vassenka veslovsky  perfectly oblonsky of course go out of bonhomie but other people say  well oblonsky stay with they    not a bit of it  levin could hear that oblonsky be smile as he speak  i simply do not consider he more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman they ’ve all make their money alike — by their work and their intelligence   oh by what work do you call it work to get hold of concession and speculate with they   of course it ’ work work in this sense that if it be not for he and other like he there would have be no railway   but that ’ not work like the work of a peasant or a learned profession   grant but it ’ work in the sense that his activity produce a result — the railway but of course you think the railway useless   no that ’ another question i be prepared to admit that they ’re useful but all profit that be out of proportion to the labor expend be dishonest   but who be to define what be proportionate   make profit by dishonest mean by trickery  say levin conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty  such as banking for instance  he go on  it ’ an evil — the amassing of huge fortune without labor just the same thing as with the spirit monopoly it ’ only the form that ’ change le roi est mort vive le roi no soon be the spirit monopoly abolish than the railway come up and bank company that too be profit without work   yes that you all be very true and clever lie down krak  stepan arkadyevitch call to his dog who be scratch and turn over all the hay he be obviously convince of the correctness of his position and so talk serenely and without haste  but you have not draw the line between honest and dishonest work that i receive a big salary than my chief clerk though he know more about the work than i do — that ’ dishonest i suppose   i can not say   well but i can tell you your receive some five thousand let ’s say for your work on the land while our host the peasant here however hard he work can never get more than fifty rouble be just as dishonest as my earn more than my chief clerk and malthus get more than a stationmaster no quite the contrary i see that society take up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people which be utterly baseless and i fancy there ’ envy at the bottom of it   no that ’ unfair  say veslovsky  how could envy come in there be something not nice about that sort of business   you say  levin go on  that it ’ unjust for i to receive five thousand while the peasant have fifty that ’ true it be unfair and i feel it but   it really be why be it we spend our time ride drink shoot do nothing while they be forever at work  say vassenka veslovsky obviously for the first time in his life reflect on the question and consequently consider it with perfect sincerity  yes you feel it but you do not give he your property  say stepan arkadyevitch intentionally as it seem provoke levin there have arise of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothersinlaw as though since they have marry sister a kind of rivalry have spring up between they as to which be order his life well and now this hostility show itself in the conversation as it begin to take a personal note  i do not give it away because no one demand that from i and if i want to i could not give it away  answer levin  and have no one to give it to   give it to this peasant he would not refuse it   yes but how be i to give it up be i to go to he and make a deed of conveyance   i do not know but if you be convince that you have no right   i ’m not at all convince on the contrary i feel i have no right to give it up that i have duty both to the land and to my family   no excuse i but if you consider this inequality be unjust why be it you do not act accordingly   well i do act negatively on that idea so far as not try to increase the difference of position exist between he and i   no excuse i that ’ a paradox   yes there ’ something of a sophistry about that  veslovsky agree  ah our host so you ’re not asleep yet  he say to the peasant who come into the barn open the creak door  how be it you ’re not asleep   no how ’ one to sleep i think our gentleman would be asleep but i hear they chatter i want to get a hook from here she will not bite  he add step cautiously with his bare foot  and where be you go to sleep   we be go out for the night with the beast   ah what a night  say veslovsky look out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be see in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open door  but listen there be woman ’s voice singe and on my word not badly too who ’ that singing my friend   that ’ the maid from hard by here   let ’s go let ’s have a walk we shall not go to sleep you know oblonsky come along   if one could only do both lie here and go  answer oblonsky stretch  it ’ capital lie here   well i shall go by myself  say veslovsky get up eagerly and put on his shoe and stocking  goodbye gentleman if it ’ fun i ’ll fetch you you ’ve treat i to some good sport and i will not forget you   he really be a capital fellow be not he  say stepan arkadyevitch when veslovsky have go out and the peasant have close the door after he  yes capital  answer levin still think of the subject of their conversation just before it seem to he that he have clearly express his thought and feeling to the good of his capacity and yet both of they straightforward man and not fool have say with one voice that he be comfort himself with sophistry this disconcert he  it ’ just this my dear boy one must do one of two thing either admit that the exist order of society be just and then stick up for one ’s right in it or acknowledge that you be enjoy unjust privilege as i do and then enjoy they and be satisfied   no if it be unjust you could not enjoy these advantage and be satisfied — at least i could not the great thing for i be to feel that i ’m not to blame   what do you say why not go after all  say stepan arkadyevitch evidently weary of the strain of thought  we sha not go to sleep you know come let ’s go  levin do not answer what they have say in the conversation that he act justly only in a negative sense absorb his thought  can it be that it ’ only possible to be just negatively  he be ask himself  how strong the smell of the fresh hay be though  say stepan arkadyevitch get up  there ’ not a chance of sleep vassenka have be get up some fun there do you hear the laughing and his voice have not we well go come along   no i ’m not come  answer levin  surely that ’ not a matter of principle too  say stepan arkadyevitch smile as he feel about in the dark for his cap  it ’ not a matter of principle but why should i go   but do you know you be prepare trouble for yourself  say stepan arkadyevitch find his cap and get up  how so   do you suppose i do not see the line you ’ve take up with your wife i hear how it ’ a question of the great consequence whether or not you ’re to be away for a couple of day  shooting that ’ all very well as an idyllic episode but for your whole life that will not answer a man must be independent he have his masculine interest a man have to be manly  say oblonsky open the door  in what way to go run after servant girl  say levin  why not if it amuse he ça ne tire pas à conséquence it will not do my wife any harm and it ’ll amuse i the great thing be to respect the sanctity of the home there should be nothing in the home but do not tie your own hand   perhaps so  say levin dryly and he turn on his side  tomorrow early i want to go shoot and i will not wake anyone and shall set off at daybreak   messieurs venez vite  they hear the voice of veslovsky come back  charmante i ’ve make such a discovery charmante a perfect gretchen and i ’ve already make friend with she really exceedingly pretty  he declare in a tone of approval as though she have be make pretty entirely on his account and he be express his satisfaction with the entertainment that have be provide for he levin pretend to be asleep while oblonsky put on his slipper and light a cigar walk out of the barn and soon their voice be lose for a long while levin could not get to sleep he hear the horse munch hay then he hear the peasant and his eld boy get ready for the night and go off for the night watch with the beast then he hear the soldier arrange his bed on the other side of the barn with his nephew the young son of their peasant host he hear the boy in his shrill little voice tell his uncle what he think about the dog who seem to he huge and terrible creature and ask what the dog be go to hunt next day and the soldier in a husky sleepy voice tell he the sportsman be go in the morning to the marsh and would shoot with their gun and then to check the boy ’s question he say  go to sleep vaska go to sleep or you ’ll catch it  and soon after he begin snore himself and everything be still he could only hear the snort of the horse and the guttural cry of a snipe  be it really only negative  he repeat to himself  well what of it it ’ not my fault  and he begin think about the next day  tomorrow i ’ll go out early and i ’ll make a point of keep cool there be lot of snipe and there be grouse too when i come back there ’ll be the note from kitty yes stiva may be right i ’m not manly with she i ’m tie to her apronstrings well it can not be help negative again  half asleep he hear the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and stepan arkadyevitch for an instant he open his eye the moon be up and in the open doorway brightly light up by the moonlight they be stand talk stepan arkadyevitch be say something of the freshness of one girl compare she to a freshly peel nut and veslovsky with his infectious laugh be repeat some word probably say to he by a peasant  ah you do your good to get round she  levin half asleep say  gentleman tomorrow before daylight  and fall asleep wake up at early dawn levin try to wake his companion vassenka lie on his stomach with one leg in a stocking thrust out be sleep so soundly that he could elicit no response oblonsky half asleep decline to get up so early even laska who be asleep curl up in the hay get up unwillingly and lazily stretch out and straighten her hind leg one after the other get on his boot and stocking take his gun and carefully open the creak door of the barn levin go out into the road the coachman be sleep in their carriage the horse be doze only one be lazily eat oats dip its nose into the manger it be still gray outofdoors  why be you up so early my dear  the old woman their hostess say come out of the hut and address he affectionately as an old friend  go shoot granny do i go this way to the marsh   straight out at the back by our threshing floor my dear and hemp patch there ’ a little footpath  step carefully with her sunburnt bare foot the old woman conduct levin and move back the fence for he by the threshing floor  straight on and you ’ll come to the marsh our lad drive the cattle there yesterday evening  laska run eagerly forward along the little path levin follow she with a light rapid step continually look at the sky he hope the sun would not be up before he reach the marsh but the sun do not delay the moon which have be bright when he go out by now shine only like a crescent of quicksilver the pink flush of dawn which one could not help see before now have to be seek to be discern at all what be before undefined vague blur in the distant countryside could now be distinctly see they be sheaf of rye the dew not visible till the sun be up wet levin ’s leg and his blouse above his belt in the high grow fragrant hemp patch from which the pollen have already fall out in the transparent stillness of morning the small sound be audible a bee fly by levin ’s ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet he look carefully and see a second and a third they be all fly from the beehive behind the hedge and they disappear over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh the path lead straight to the marsh the marsh could be recognize by the mist which rise from it thick in one place and thin in another so that the reed and willow bush sway like island in this mist at the edge of the marsh and the road peasant boy and man who have be herd for the night be lie and in the dawn all be asleep under their coat not far from they be three hobbled horse one of they clank a chain laska walk beside her master press a little forward and look round pass the sleep peasant and reach the first reed levin examine his pistol and let his dog off one of the horse a sleek darkbrown threeyearold see the dog start away switch its tail and snort the other horse too be frightened and splash through the water with their hobbled leg and draw their hoof out of the thick mud with a squelch sound they bound out of the marsh laska stop look ironically at the horse and inquiringly at levin levin pat laska and whistle as a sign that she might begin laska run joyfully and anxiously through the slush that sway under she run into the marsh among the familiar scent of root marsh plant and slime and the extraneous smell of horse dung laska detect at once a smell that pervade the whole marsh the scent of that strongsmelle bird that always excite she more than any other here and there among the moss and marsh plant this scent be very strong but it be impossible to determine in which direction it grow strong or faint to find the direction she have to go far away from the wind not feel the motion of her leg laska bound with a stiff gallop so that at each bind she could stop short to the right away from the wind that blow from the east before sunrise and turn face the wind sniff in the air with dilated nostril she feel at once that not their track only but they themselves be here before she and not one but many laska slacken her speed they be here but where precisely she could not yet determine to find the very spot she begin to make a circle when suddenly her master ’s voice draw she off  laska here  he ask point she to a different direction she stop ask he if she have well not go on do as she have begin but he repeat his command in an angry voice point to a spot cover with water where there could not be anything she obey he pretend she be look so as to please he go round it and go back to her former position and be at once aware of the scent again now when he be not hinder she she know what to do and without look at what be under her foot and to her vexation stumble over a high stump into the water but right herself with her strong supple leg she begin make the circle which be to make all clear to she the scent of they reach she strong and strong and more and more defined and all at once it become perfectly clear to she that one of they be here behind this tuft of reed five pace in front of she she stop and her whole body be still and rigid on her short leg she could see nothing in front of she but by the scent she know it be sit not more than five pace off she stand still feel more and more conscious of it and enjoy it in anticipation her tail be stretch straight and tense and only wag at the extreme end her mouth be slightly open her ear raise one ear have be turn wrong side out as she run up and she breathe heavily but warily and still more warily look round but more with her eye than her head to her master he be come along with the face she know so well though the eye be always terrible to she he stumble over the stump as he come and move as she think extraordinarily slowly she think he come slowly but he be run notice laska ’s special attitude as she crouch on the ground as it be scratch big print with her hind paw and with her mouth slightly open levin know she be point at grouse and with an inward prayer for luck especially with the first bird he run up to she come quite close up to she he could from his height look beyond she and he see with his eye what she be see with her nose in a space between two little thicket at a couple of yard  distance he could see a grouse turn its head it be listen then lightly preen and fold its wing it disappear round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail  fetch it fetch it  shout levin give laska a shove from behind  but i can not go  think laska  where be i to go from here i feel they but if i move forward i shall know nothing of where they be or who they be  but then he shove she with his knee and in an excited whisper say  fetch it laska   well if that ’ what he wish i ’ll do it but i can not answer for myself now  she think and dart forward as fast as her leg would carry she between the thick bush she scent nothing now she could only see and hear without understand anything ten pace from her former place a grouse rise with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wing and immediately after the shot it splash heavily with its white breast on the wet mire another bird do not linger but rise behind levin without the dog when levin turn towards it it be already some way off but his shot catch it fly twenty pace far the second grouse rise upwards and whirl round like a ball drop heavily on a dry place  come this be go to be some good  think levin pack the warm and fat grouse into his game bag  eh laska will it be good  when levin after load his gun move on the sun have fully rise though unseen behind the stormcloud the moon have lose all of its luster and be like a white cloud in the sky not a single star could be see the sedge silvery with dew before now shine like gold the stagnant pool be all like amber the blue of the grass have change to yellowgreen the marsh bird twitter and swarm about the brook and upon the bush that glitter with dew and cast long shadow a hawk wake up and settle on a haycock turn its head from side to side and look discontentedly at the marsh crow be fly about the field and a barelegged boy be drive the horse to an old man who have get up from under his long coat and be comb his hair the smoke from the gun be white as milk over the green of the grass one of the boy run up to levin  uncle there be duck here yesterday  he shout to he and he walk a little way off behind he and levin be doubly pleased in sight of the boy who express his approval at kill three snipe one after another straight off the sportsman ’s say that if the first beast or the first bird be not miss the day will be lucky turn out correct at ten o’clock levin weary hungry and happy after a tramp of twenty mile

have be unmistakably overwork on the previous day be off his feed and out of sort the coachman say he be  overdrive yesterday konstantin dmitrievitch yes indeed drive ten mile with no sense  the other unpleasant incident which for the first minute destroy his good humor though later he laugh at it a great deal be to find that of all the provision kitty have provide in such abundance that one would have think there be enough for a week nothing be leave on his way back tired and hungry from shoot levin have so distinct a vision of meatpie that as he approach the hut he seem to smell and taste they as laska have smell the game and he immediately tell philip to give he some it appear that there be no pie leave nor even any chicken  well this fellow ’s appetite  say stepan arkadyevitch laugh and point at vassenka veslovsky  i never suffer from loss of appetite but he ’ really marvelous   well it can not be help  say levin look gloomily at veslovsky  well philip give i some beef then   the beef ’ be eat and the bone give to the dog  answer philip levin be so hurt that he say in a tone of vexation  you might have leave i something  and he feel ready to cry  then put away the game  he say

more offensive the preparation for the approach birth the date of which they reckon it seem on their finger he try to turn a deaf ear to these discussion of the good pattern of long clothe for the come baby try to turn away and avoid see the mysterious endless strip of knit the triangle of linen and so on to which dolly attach special importance the birth of a son he be certain it would be a son which be promise he but which he still could not believe in — so marvelous it seem — present itself to his mind on one hand as a happiness so immense and therefore so incredible on the other as an event so mysterious that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be and consequent preparation for it as for something ordinary that do happen to people jar on he as confusing and humiliating but the princess do not understand his feeling and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference and so she give he no peace she have commission

where ’ the visitor   the gentleman ’ go to his room  levin come upon veslovsky at the moment when the latter have unpack his thing from his trunk and lay out some new song be put on his gaiter to go out ride whether there be something exceptional in levin ’s face or that vassenka be himself conscious that ce petit brin de cour he be make be out of place in this family but he be somewhat as much as a young man in society can be disconcerted at levin ’s entrance  you ride in gaiter   yes it ’ much clean  say vassenka put his fat leg on a chair fasten the bottom hook and smile with simplehearted good humor he be undoubtedly a goodnatured fellow and levin feel sorry for he and ashamed of himself as his host when he see the shy look on vassenka ’s face on the table lie a piece of stick which they have break together that morning try their strength levin take the fragment in his hand and begin smash it up break bit off the stick not know how to begin  i want  he pause but suddenly remember kitty and everything that have happen he say look he resolutely in the face  i have order the horse to be putto for you   how so  vassenka begin in surprise  to drive where   for you

stick  and i ’m not expect visitor and nothing have happen but i beg you to go away you can explain my rudeness as you like  vassenka draw himself up  i beg you to explain  he say with dignity understanding at last  i can not explain  levin say softly and deliberately try to control the trembling of his jaw  and you ’d well not ask  and as the split end be all break off levin clutch the thick end in his finger break the stick in two and carefully catch the end as it fall probably the sight of those nervous finger of the muscle he have prove that morning at gymnastic of the glitter eye the soft voice and quiver jaw convince vassenka well than any word he bow shrug his shoulder and smile contemptuously  can i not see oblonsky  the shrug and the smile do not irritate levin  what else be there for he to do  he think  i ’ll send he to you at once   what madness be this  stepan arkadyevitch say when after hear from his friend that he be be turn out of the house he find levin in the garden where he be walk about wait for his guest ’s departure  mais c’est ridicule what fly have sting you mais c’est du dernier ridicule what do you think if a young man  but the place where levin have be sting be evidently still sore for he turn pale again when stepan arkadyevitch would have enlarge on the reason and he himself cut he short  please do not go into it i can not help it i feel ashamed of how i ’m treat you and he but it will not be i imagine a great grief to he to go and his presence be distasteful to i and to my wife   but it ’ insult to he et puis c’est ridicule   and to i it ’ both insulting and distressing and i ’m not at fault in any way and there ’ no need for i to suffer   well this i do not expect of you on peut être jaloux mais à ce point c’est du dernier ridicule  levin turn quickly and walk away from he into the depth of the avenue and he go on walk up and down alone soon he hear the rumble of the trap and see from behind the tree how vassenka sit in the hay unluckily there be no seat in the trap in his scotch cap be drive along the avenue jolt up and down over the rut  what ’ this  levin think when a footman run out of the house and stop the trap it be the mechanician whom levin have totally forget the mechanician bow low say something to veslovsky then clamber into the trap and they drive off together stepan arkadyevitch and the princess be much upset by levin ’s action and he himself feel not only in the high degree ridicule but also utterly guilty and disgraced but remember what suffering he and his wife have be through when he ask himself how he should act another time he answer that he should do just the same again in spite of all this towards the end of that day everyone except the princess who could not pardon levin ’s action become extraordinarily lively and goodhumored like child after a punishment or grownup people after a dreary ceremonious reception so that by the evening vassenka ’s dismissal be speak of in the absence of the princess as though it be some remote event and dolly who have inherit her father ’s gift of humorous storytelling make varenka helpless with laughter as she relate for the third and fourth time always with fresh humorous addition how she have only just put on her new shoe for the benefit of the visitor and on go into the drawingroom hear suddenly the rumble of the trap and who should be in the trap but vassenka himself with his scotch cap and his song and his gaiter and all sit in the hay  if only you ’d order out the carriage but no and then i hear  stop  oh i think they ’ve relent i look out and behold a fat german be sit down by he and drive away and my new shoe all for nothing  darya alexandrovna carry out her intention and go to see anna she be sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything levin dislike she quite understand how right the levins be in not wish to have anything to do with vronsky but she feel she must go and see anna and show she that her feeling could not be change in spite of the change in her position that she might be independent of the levins in this expedition darya alexandrovna send to the village to hire horse for the drive but levin learn of it go to she to protest  what make you suppose that i dislike your go but even if i do dislike it i should still more dislike your not take my horse  he say  you never tell i that you be go for certain hire horse in the village be disagreeable to i and what ’ of more importance they ’ll undertake the job and never get you there i have horse and if you do not want to wound i you ’ll take mine  darya alexandrovna have to consent and on the day fix levin have ready for his sisterinlaw a set of four horse and relay get they together from the farm and saddlehorse — not at all a smartlooking set but capable of take darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day at that moment when horse be want for the princess who be go and for the midwife it be a difficult matter for levin to make up the number but the duty of hospitality would not let he allow darya alexandrovna to hire horse when stay in his house moreover he be well aware that the twenty rouble that would be ask for the journey be a serious matter for her darya alexandrovna ’s pecuniary affair which be in a very unsatisfactory state be take to heart by the levins as if they be their own darya alexandrovna by levin ’s advice start before daybreak the road be good the carriage comfortable the horse trot along merrily and on the box besides the coachman sit the countinghouse clerk whom levin be send instead of a groom for great security darya alexandrovna doze and wake up only on reach the inn where the horse be to be change after drink tea at the same welltodo peasant ’s with whom levin have stay on the way to sviazhsky ’s and chat with the woman about their child and with the old man about count vronsky whom the latter praise very highly darya alexandrovna at ten o’clock go on again at home look after her child she have no time to think so now after this journey of four hour all the thought she have suppress before rush swarm into her brain and she think over all her life as she never have before and from the most different point of view her thought seem strange even to herself at first she think about the child about whom she be uneasy although the princess and kitty she reckon more upon she have promise to look after they  if only masha do not begin her naughty trick if grisha be not kick by a horse and lily ’s stomach be not upset again  she think but these question of the present be succeed by question of the immediate future she begin think how she have to get a new flat in moscow for the come winter to renew the drawingroom furniture and to make her eld girl a cloak then question of the more remote future occur to she how she be to place her child in the world  the girl be all right  she think  but the boy   it ’ very well that i ’m teach grisha but of course that ’ only because i be free myself now i ’m not with child stiva of course there ’ no count on and with the help of goodnatured friend i can bring they up but if there ’ another baby come  and the thought strike she how untruly it be say that the curse lay on woman be that in sorrow she should bring forth child  the birth itself that ’ nothing but the month of carry the child — that ’ what ’ so intolerable  she think picture to herself her last pregnancy and the death of the last baby and she recall the conversation she have just have with the young woman at the inn on be ask whether she have any child the handsome young woman have answer cheerfully  i have a girl baby but god set i free i bury she last lent   well do you grieve very much for she  ask darya alexandrovna  why grieve the old man have grandchild enough as it be it be only a trouble no working nor nothing only a tie  this answer have strike darya alexandrovna as revolt in spite of the goodnatured and pleasing face of the young woman but now she could not help recall these word in those cynical word there be indeed a grain of truth  yes altogether  think darya alexandrovna look back over her whole existence during those fifteen year of her married life  pregnancy sickness mental incapacity indifference to everything and most of all — hideousness kitty young and pretty as she be even kitty have lose her look and i when i ’m with child become hideous i know it the birth the agony the hideous agony that last moment   then the nursing the sleepless night the fearful pain  darya alexandrovna shudder at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breast which she have suffer with almost every child  then the child ’s illness that everlasting apprehension then bring they up evil propensity  she think of little masha ’s crime among the raspberry  education latin — it ’ all so incomprehensible and difficult and on the top of it all the death of these child  and there rise again before her imagination the cruel memory that always tear her mother ’s heart of the death of her last little baby who have die of croup his funeral the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin and her own tear heart and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its project temple and the open wondering little mouth see in the coffin at the moment when it be be cover with the little pink lid with a cross braid on it  and all this what ’ it for what be to come of it all that i ’m waste my life never have a moment ’s peace either with child or nurse a child forever irritable peevish wretched myself and worry other repulsive to my husband while the child be grow up unhappy badly educated and penniless even now if it be not for spend the summer at the levins  i do not know how we should be manage to live of course kostya and kitty have so much tact that we do not feel it but it can not go on they ’ll have child they will not be able to keep we it ’ a drag on they as it be how be papa who have hardly anything leave for himself to help we so that i can not even bring the child up by myself and may find it hard with the help of other people at the cost of humiliation why even if we suppose the great good luck that the child do not die and i bring they up somehow at the very good they ’ll simply be decent people that ’ all i can hope for and to gain simply that — what agony what toil one ’s whole life ruin  again she recall what the young peasant woman have say and again she be revolt at the thought but she could not help admit that there be a grain of brutal truth in the word  be it far now mihail  darya alexandrovna ask the countinghouse clerk to turn her mind from thought that be frighten she  from this village they say it ’ five mile  the carriage drive along the village street and onto a bridge on the bridge be a crowd of peasant woman with coil of tie for the sheaf on their shoulder gaily and noisily chatter they stand still on the bridge stare inquisitively at the carriage all the face turn to darya alexandrovna look to she healthy and happy make she envious of their enjoyment of life  they ’re all live they ’re all enjoy life  darya alexandrovna still muse when she have pass the peasant woman and be drive uphill again at a trot seat comfortably on the soft spring of the old carriage  while i let out as it be from prison from the world of worry that fret i to death be only look about i now for an instant you all live those peasant woman and my sister natalia and varenka and anna whom i be go to see — all but not i  and they attack anna what for be i any well i have anyway a husband i love — not as i should like to love he still i do love he while anna never love hers how be she to blame she want to live god have put that in our heart very likely i should have do the same even to this day i do not feel sure i do right in listen to she at that terrible time when she come to i in moscow i ought then to have cast off my husband and have begin my life fresh i might have love and have be love in reality and be it any well as it be i do not respect he he ’ necessary to i  she think about her husband  and i put up with he be that any well at that time i could still have be admire i have beauty leave i still  darya alexandrovna pursue her thought and she would have like to look at herself in the lookingglass she have a travel lookingglass in her handbag and she want to take it out but look at the back of the coachman and the sway countinghouse clerk she feel that she would be ashamed if either of they be to look round and she do not take out the glass but without look in the glass she think that even now it be not too late and she think of sergey ivanovitch who be always particularly attentive to she of stiva ’s goodhearted friend turovtsin who have help she nurse her child through the scarlatina and be in love with she and there be someone else a quite young man who — her husband have tell she it as a joke — think she more beautiful than either of her sister and the most passionate and impossible romance rise before darya alexandrovna ’s imagination  anna do quite right and certainly i shall never reproach she for it she be happy she make another person happy and she ’ not break down as i be but most likely just as she always be bright clever open to every impression  think darya alexandrovna — and a sly smile curve her lip for as she ponder on anna ’s love affair darya alexandrovna construct on parallel line an almost identical love affair for herself with an imaginary composite figure the ideal man who be in love with she she like anna confess the whole affair to her husband and the amazement and perplexity of stepan arkadyevitch at this avowal make she smile in such daydream she reach the turning of the highroad that lead to vozdvizhenskoe the coachman pull up his four horse and look round to the right to a field of rye where some peasant be sit on a cart the countinghouse clerk be just go to jump down but on second thought he shout peremptorily to the peasant instead and beckon to they to come up the wind that seem to blow as they drive drop when the carriage stand still gadfly settle on the steam horse that angrily shake they off the metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe that come to they from the cart cease one of the peasant get up and come towards the carriage  well you be slow  the countinghouse clerk shout angrily to the peasant who be step slowly with his bare foot over the rut of the rough dry road  come along do  a curlyheaded old man with a bit of bast tie round his hair and his bent back dark with perspiration come towards the carriage quicken his step and take hold of the mudguard with his sunburnt hand  vozdvizhenskoe the manor house the count ’s  he repeat  go on to the end of this track then turn to the left straight along the avenue and you ’ll come right upon it but whom do you want the count himself   well be they at home my good man  darya alexandrovna say vaguely not know how to ask about anna even of this peasant  at home for sure  say the peasant shift from one bare foot to the other and leave a distinct print of five toe and a heel in the dust  sure to be at home  he repeat evidently eager to talk  only yesterday visitor arrive there ’ a sight of visitor come what do you want  he turn round and call to a lad who be shout something to he from the cart  oh you all ride by here not long since to look at a reaping machine they ’ll be home by now and who will you be belong to   we ’ve come a long way  say the coachman climb onto the box  so it ’ not far   i tell you it ’ just here as soon as you get out  he say keep hold all the while of the carriage a healthylooking broadshouldered young fellow come up too  what be it laborer they want for the harvest  he ask  i do not know my boy   so you keep to the left and you ’ll come right on it  say the peasant unmistakably loth to let the traveler go and eager to converse the coachman start the horse but they be only just turn off when the peasant shout  stop hi friend stop  call the two voice the coachman stop  they ’re come they ’re yonder  shout the peasant  see what a turnout  he say point to four person on horseback and two in a charàbanc come along the road they be vronsky with a jockey veslovsky and anna on horseback and princess varvara and sviazhsky in the charàbanc they have go out to look at the working of a new reaping machine when the carriage stop the party on horseback be come at a walk pace anna be in front beside veslovsky anna quietly walk her horse a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail her beautiful head with her black hair stray loose under her high hat her full shoulder her slender waist in her black riding habit and all the ease and grace of her deportment impress dolly for the first minute it seem to she unsuitable for anna to be on horseback the conception of ride on horseback for a lady be in darya alexandrovna ’s mind associate with idea of youthful flirtation and frivolity which in her opinion be unbecoming in anna ’s position but when she have scrutinize she see she close she be at once reconcile to her riding in spite of her elegance everything be so simple quiet and dignified in the attitude the dress and the movement of anna that nothing could have be more natural beside anna on a hotlooking gray cavalry horse be vassenka veslovsky in his scotch cap with float ribbon his stout leg stretch out in front obviously pleased with his own appearance darya alexandrovna could not suppress a goodhumored smile as she recognize he behind ride vronsky on a dark bay mare obviously heated from gallop he be hold she in pull at the rein after he ride a little man in the dress of a jockey sviazhsky and princess varvara in a new charàbanc with a big ravenblack trot horse overtake the party on horseback anna ’s face suddenly beam with a joyful smile at the instant when in the little figure huddle in a corner of the old carriage she recognize dolly she utter a cry start in the saddle and set her horse into a gallop on reach the carriage she jump off without assistance and hold up her riding habit she run up to greet dolly  i think it be you and dare not think it how delightful you can not fancy how glad i be  she say at one moment press her face against dolly and kiss she and at the next hold she off and examine she with a smile  here ’ a delightful surprise alexey  she say look round at vronsky who have dismount and be walk towards they vronsky take off his tall gray hat go up to dolly  you would not believe how glad we be to see you  he say give peculiar significance to the word and show his strong white tooth in a smile vassenka veslovsky without get off his horse take off his cap and greet the visitor by gleefully wave the ribbon over his head  that ’ princess varvara  anna say in reply to a glance of inquiry from dolly as the charàbanc drive up  ah  say darya alexandrovna and unconsciously her face betray her dissatisfaction princess varvara be her husband ’s aunt and she have long know she and do not respect she she know that princess varvara have pass her whole life toady on her rich relation but that she should now be sponge on vronsky a man who be nothing to she mortify dolly on account of her kinship with her husband anna notice dolly ’s expression and be disconcerted by it she blush drop her riding habit and stumble over it darya alexandrovna go up to the charàbanc and coldly greet princess varvara sviazhsky too she know he inquire how his queer friend with the young wife be and run his eye over the illmatched horse and the carriage with its patched mudguard propose to the lady that they should get into the charàbanc  and i ’ll get into this vehicle  he say  the horse be quiet and the princess drive capitally   no stay as you be  say anna come up  and we ’ll go in the carriage  and take dolly ’s arm she draw she away darya alexandrovna ’s eye be fairly dazzle by the elegant carriage of a pattern she have never see before the splendid horse and the elegant and gorgeous people surround she but what strike she most of all be the change that have take place in anna whom she know so well and love any other woman a less close observer not know anna before or not have think as darya alexandrovna have be think on the road would not have notice anything special in anna but now dolly be strike by that temporary beauty which be only find in woman during the moment of love and which she see now in anna ’s face everything in her face the clearly mark dimple in her cheek and chin the line of her lip the smile which as it be flutter about her face the brilliance of her eye the grace and rapidity of her movement the fulness of the note of her voice even the manner in which with a sort of angry friendliness she answer veslovsky when he ask permission to get on her cob so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost — it be all peculiarly fascinating and it seem as if she be herself aware of it and rejoice in it when both the woman be seat in the carriage a sudden embarrassment come over both of they anna be disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry dolly fix upon she dolly be embarrassed because after sviazhsky ’s phrase about  this vehicle  she could not help feel ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which anna be sit with she the coachman philip and the countinghouse clerk be experience the same sensation the countinghouse clerk to conceal his confusion busy himself settle the lady but philip the coachman become sullen and be brace himself not to be overawe in future by this external superiority he smile ironically look at the raven horse and be already decide in his own mind that this smart trotter in the charàbanc be only good for promenage and would not do thirty mile straight off in the heat the peasant have all get up from the cart and be inquisitively and mirthfully stare at the meeting of the friend make their comment on it  they ’re pleased too have not see each other for a long while  say the curlyheaded old man with the bast round his hair  i say uncle gerasim if we could take that raven horse now to cart the corn that  ud be quick work   lookee be that a woman in breech  say one of they point to vassenka veslovsky sit in a side saddle  nay a man see how smartly he ’ go it   eh lad seem we ’re not go to sleep then   what chance of sleep today  say the old man with a sidelong look at the sun  midday ’s past lookee get your hook and come along  anna look at dolly ’s thin careworn face with its wrinkle fill with dust from the road and she be on the point of say what she be think that be that dolly have get thin but conscious that she herself have grow handsome and that dolly ’s eye be tell she so she sigh and begin to speak about herself  you be look at i  she say  and wonder how i can be happy in my position well it ’ shameful to confess but i   i ’m inexcusably happy something magical have happen to i like a dream when you ’re frightened panicstricken and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horror be no more i have wake up i have live through the misery the dread and now for a long while past especially since we ’ve be here i ’ve be so happy  she say with a timid smile of inquiry look at dolly  how glad i be  say dolly smile involuntarily speak more coldly than she want to  i ’m very glad for you why have not you write to i   why because i have not the courage you forget my position   to i have not the courage if you know how i   i look at  darya alexandrovna want to express her thought of the morning but for some reason it seem to she now out of place to do so  but of that we ’ll talk later what ’ this what be all these building  she ask want to change the conversation and point to the red and green roof that come into view behind the green hedge of acacia and lilac  quite a little town  but anna do not answer  no no how do you look at my position what do you think of it  she ask  i consider  darya alexandrovna be begin but at that instant vassenka veslovsky have bring the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost gallop past they bump heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle  he ’ do it anna arkadyevna  he shout anna do not even glance at he but again it seem to darya alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage and so she cut short her thought  i do not think anything  she say  but i always love you and if one love anyone one love the whole person just as they be and not as one would like they to be  anna take her eye off her friend ’s face and drop her eyelid this be a new habit dolly have not see in she

be spill all over her little chest the baby be be feed and the russian nursery maid be evidently share her meal neither the wetnurse nor the headnurse be there they be in the next room from which come the sound of their conversation in the queer french which be their only means of communication hear anna ’s voice a smart tall english nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walk in at the door hurriedly shake her fair curl and immediately begin to defend herself though anna have not find fault with she at every word anna say the english nurse say hurriedly several time  yes my lady  the rosy baby with her black eyebrow and hair her sturdy red little body with tight gooseflesh skin delight darya alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stare at the

dress tuck up behind it be wonderfully charm look round like some little wild animal at the grownup big people with her bright black eye she smile unmistakably pleased at their admire she and hold her leg sideways she press vigorously on her arm and rapidly draw her whole back up after and then make another step forward with her little arm but the whole atmosphere of the nursery and especially the english nurse darya alexandrovna do not like at all it be only on the supposition that no good nurse would have enter so irregular a household as anna ’s that darya alexandrovna could explain to herself how anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing disreputablelooking woman as nurse to her child besides from a few word that be drop darya alexandrovna see at once that anna the two nurse and the child have no common existence and that the mother ’s visit be something exceptional anna want to get the baby her plaything and could not find it most amazing of all be the fact that on be ask how many tooth the baby have anna answer wrong and know nothing about the two last tooth  i sometimes feel sorry i ’m so superfluous here  say anna go out of the nursery and hold up her skirt so as to escape the plaything stand in the doorway  it be very different with my first child   i expect it to be the other way  say darya alexandrovna shyly  oh no by the way do you

goodnatured woman and i be so grateful to she in petersburg there be a moment when a chaperon be absolutely essential for i then she turn up but really she be goodnatured she do a great deal to alleviate my position i see you do not understand all the difficulty of my position   there in petersburg  she add  here i ’m perfectly at ease and happy well of that later on though then sviazhsky — he ’ the marshal of the district and he ’ a very good sort of a man but he want to get something out of alexey you understand with his property now that we be settle in the country alexey can exercise great influence then there ’ tushkevitch — you have see he you know — betsy ’s admirer now he ’ be throw over and he ’ come to see we as alexey say he ’ one of those people who be very pleasant if one accept they for what they try to appear to be et puis il est comme il faut as princess varvara say then veslovsky   you know he a very nice boy  she say and a sly smile curve her lip  what ’ this wild story about he and the levins veslovsky tell alexey about it and we do not believe it il est très gentil et naïf  she say again with the same smile  man need occupation and alexey need a circle so i value all these people we have to have the house lively and gay so that alexey may not long for any novelty then you ’ll see the steward — a german a very good fellow and he understand his work alexey have a very high opinion of he then the doctor a young man not quite a nihilist perhaps but you know eat with his knife   but a very good doctor then the architect une petite cour   here ’ dolly for you princess you be so anxious to see she  say anna come out with darya alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where princess varvara be sit in the shade at an embroidery frame work at a cover for count alexey kirillovitch ’s easy chair  she say she do not want anything before dinner but please order some lunch for she and i ’ll go and look for alexey and bring they all in  princess varvara give dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception and begin at once explain to she that she be live with anna because she have always care more for she than her sister katerina pavlovna the aunt that have bring anna up and that now when everyone have abandon anna she think it her duty to help she in this most difficult period of transition  her husband will give she a divorce and then i shall go

everyone do as he please till dinner time dinner at seven o’clock stiva do very rightly to send you he need their support you know that through his mother and brother he can do anything and then they do so much good he do not tell you about his hospital ce sera admirable — everything from paris  their conversation be interrupt by anna who have find the man of the party in the billiard room and return with they to the terrace there be still a long time before the dinnerhour it be exquisite weather and so several different method of spend the next two hour be propose there be very many method of pass the time at vozdvizhenskoe and these be all unlike those in use at pokrovskoe  une partie de lawntennis  veslovsky propose with his handsome smile  we ’ll be partner again anna arkadyevna   no it ’ too hot well stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat show darya alexandrovna the river banks  vronsky propose  i agree to anything  say sviazhsky  i imagine that what dolly would like well would be a stroll — wouldn’t you and then the boat perhaps  say anna so it be decide veslovsky and tushkevitch go off to the bathing place promise to get the boat ready and to wait there for they they walk along the path in two couple anna with sviazhsky and dolly with vronsky dolly be a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surrounding in which she find herself abstractly theoretically she do not merely justify she positively approve of anna ’s conduct as be indeed not unfrequent with woman of unimpeachable virtue weary of the monotony of respectable existence at a distance she not only excuse illicit love she positively envy it besides she love anna with all her heart but see anna in actual life among these stranger with this fashionable tone that be so new to darya alexandrovna she feel ill at ease what she dislike particularly be see princess varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comfort she enjoy as a general principle abstractly dolly approve of anna ’s action but to see the man for whose sake her action have be take be disagreeable to she moreover she have never like vronsky she think he very proud and see nothing in he of which he could be proud except his wealth but against her own will here in his own house he overawe she more than ever and she could not be at ease with he she feel with he the same feeling she have have with the maid about her dressing jacket just as with the maid she have feel not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at she darns so she feel with he not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at herself dolly be ill at ease and try to find a subject of conversation even though she suppose that through his pride praise of his house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to he she do all the same tell he how much she like his house  yes it ’ a very fine building and in the good oldfashioned style  he say  i like so much the court in front of the step be that always so   oh no  he say and his face beam with pleasure  if you could only have see that court last spring  and he begin at first rather diffidently but more and more carry away by the subject as he go on to draw her attention to the various detail of the decoration of his house and garden it be evident that have devote a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home vronsky feel a need to show off the improvement to a new person and be genuinely delighted at darya alexandrovna ’s praise  if you would care to look at the hospital and be not tired indeed it ’ not far shall we go  he say glance into her face to convince himself that she be not bored  be you come anna  he turn to she  we will come will not we  she say address sviazhsky  mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre veslovsky et tushkevitch se morfondre là dans le bateau we must send and tell they   yes this be a monument he be set up here  say anna turn to dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she have previously talk about the hospital  oh it ’ a work of real importance  say sviazhsky but to show he be not try to ingratiate himself with vronsky he promptly add some slightly critical remark  i wonder though count  he say  that while you do so much for the health of the peasant you take so little interest in the school   c’est devenu tellement commun les écoles  say vronsky  you understand it ’ not on that account but it just happen so my interest have be divert elsewhere this way then to the hospital  he say to darya alexandrovna point to a turning out of the avenue the lady put up their parasol and turn into the side path after go

round a hole where the workman be slake lime he stand still with the architect and begin talk rather warmly  the front be still too low  he say to anna who have ask what be the matter  i say the foundation ought to be raise  say anna  yes of course it would have be much well anna arkadyevna  say the architect  but now it ’ too late   yes i take a great interest in it  anna answer sviazhsky who be express his surprise at her knowledge of architecture  this new building ought to have be in harmony with the hospital it be an afterthought and be begin without a plan  vronsky have finish his talk with the architect join the lady and lead they inside the hospital although they be still at work on the cornice outside and be paint on the ground floor upstairs almost all the room be finish go up the broad castiron staircase to the landing they walk into the first large room the wall be stucco to look like marble the huge plateglass window be already in only the parquet floor be not yet

they go into the corridor here vronsky show they the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system then he show they marble bath and bed with extraordinary spring then he show they the ward one after another the storeroom the linen room then the heating stove of a new pattern then the trolley which would make no noise as they carry everything need along the corridor and many other thing sviazhsky as a connoisseur in the late mechanical improvement appreciate everything fully dolly simply wonder at all she have not see before and anxious to understand it all make minute inquiry about everything which give vronsky great satisfaction  yes i imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fit hospital in russia  say sviazhsky  and will not you have a lyingin ward  ask dolly  that ’ so much need in the country i have often  in spite of his usual courtesy vronsky interrupt she  this be not a lyingin home but a hospital for the sick and be intend for all disease except infectious complaint  he say  ah look at this  and he roll up to darya alexandrovna an invalid chair that have just be order for the convalescent  look  he sit down in the chair and begin move it  the patient can not walk — still too weak perhaps or something wrong with his leg but he must have air and he move roll himself along  darya alexandrovna be interested by everything she like everything very much but most of all she like vronsky himself with his natural simplehearted eagerness  yes he ’ a very nice good man  she think several time not hear what he say but look at he and penetrate into his expression while she mentally put herself in anna ’s place she like he so much just now with his eager interest that she see how anna could be in love with he  no i think the princess be tired and horse do not interest she  vronsky say to anna who want to go on to the stable where sviazhsky wish to see the new stallion  you go on while i escort the princess home and we ’ll have a little talk  he say  if you would like that  he add turn to she  i know nothing about horse and i shall be delighted  answer darya alexandrovna rather astonished she see by vronsky ’s face that he want something from she she be not mistake as soon as they have pass through the little gate back into the garden he look in the direction anna have take and have make sure that she could neither hear nor see they he begin  you guess that i have something i want to say to you  he say look at she with laugh eye  i be not wrong in believe you to be a friend of anna ’s  he take off his hat and take out his handkerchief wipe his head which be grow bald darya alexandrovna make no answer and merely stare at he with dismay when she be leave alone with he she suddenly feel afraid his laugh eye and stern expression scare she the most diverse supposition as to what he be about to speak of to she flash into her brain  he be go to beg i to come to stay with they with the child and i shall have to refuse or to create a set that will receive anna in moscow or be not it vassenka veslovsky and his relation with anna or perhaps about kitty that he feel he be to blame  all her conjecture be unpleasant but she do not guess what he really want to talk about to she  you have so much influence with anna she be so fond of you  he say  do help i  darya alexandrovna look with timid inquiry into his energetic face which under the limetree be continually be light up in patch by the sunshine and then pass into complete shadow again she wait for he to say more but he walk in silence beside she scratch with his cane in the gravel  you have come to see we you the only woman of anna ’s former friend — i do not count princess varvara — but i know that you have do this not because you regard our position as normal but because understand all the difficulty of the position you still love she and want to be a help to she have i understand you rightly  he ask look round at she  oh yes  answer darya alexandrovna put down her sunshade  but   no  he break in and unconsciously oblivious of the awkward position into which he be put his companion he stop abruptly so that she have to stop short too  no one feel more deeply and intensely than i do all the difficulty of anna ’s position and that you may well understand if you do i the honor of suppose i have any heart i be to blame for that position and that be why i feel it   i understand  say darya alexandrovna involuntarily admire the sincerity and firmness with which he say this  but just because you feel yourself responsible you exaggerate it i be afraid  she say  her position in the world be difficult i can well understand   in the world it be hell  he bring out quickly frown darkly  you can not imagine moral suffering great than what she go through in petersburg in that fortnight   and i beg you to believe it   yes but here so long as neither anna   nor you miss society   society  he say contemptuously  how could i miss society   so far — and it may be so always — you be happy and at peace i see in anna that she be happy perfectly happy she have have time to tell i so much already  say darya alexandrovna smile and involuntarily as she say this at the same moment a doubt enter her mind whether anna really be happy but vronsky it appear have no doubt on that score  yes yes  he say  i know that she have revive after all her suffering she be happy she be happy in the present but i i be afraid of what be before we   i beg your pardon you would like to walk on   no i do not mind   well then let we sit here  darya alexandrovna sit down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue he stand up face she  i see that she be happy  he repeat and the doubt whether she be happy sink more deeply into darya alexandrovna ’s mind  but can it last whether we have act rightly or wrongly be another question but the die be cast  he say pass from russian to french  and we be bind together for life we be unite you all the tie of love that we hold most sacred we have a child we may have other child but the law and all the condition of our position be such that thousand of complication arise which she do not see and do not want to see and that one can well understand but i can not help see they my daughter be by law not my daughter but karenin ’s i can not bear this falsity  he say with a vigorous gesture of refusal and he look with gloomy inquiry towards darya alexandrovna she make no answer but simply gaze at he he go on  one day a son may be bear my son and he will be legally a karenin he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property and however happy we may be in our home life and however many child we may have there will be no real tie between we they will be karenins you can understand the bitterness and horror of this position i have try to speak of this to anna it irritate she she do not understand and to she i can not speak plainly of all this now look at another side i be happy happy in her love but i must have occupation i have find occupation and be proud of what i be do and consider it noble than the pursuit of my former companion at court and in the army and most certainly i would not change the work i be do for theirs i be work here settle in my own place and i be happy and contented and we need nothing more to make we happy i love my work here ce n’est pas un pisaller on the contrary  darya alexandrovna notice that at this point in his explanation he grow confused and she do not quite understand this digression but she feel that have once begin to speak of matter near his heart of which he could not speak to anna he be now make a clean breast of everything and that the question of his pursuit in the country fall into the same category of matter near his heart as the question of his relation with anna  well i will go on  he say collect himself  the great thing be that as i work i want to have a conviction that what i be do will not die with i that i shall have heir to come after i — and this i have not conceive the position of a man who know that his child the child of the woman he love will not be his but will belong to someone who hate they and care nothing about they it be awful  he pause evidently much move  yes indeed i see that but what can anna do  query darya alexandrovna  yes that bring i to the object of my conversation  he say calm himself with an effort  anna can it depend on she even to petition the tsar for legitimization a divorce be essential and that depend on anna her husband agree to a divorce — at that time your husband have arrange it completely and now i know he would not refuse it it be only a matter of write to he he say plainly at that time that if she express the desire he would not refuse of course  he say gloomily  it be one of those pharisaical cruelty of which only such heartless man be capable he know what agony any recollection of he must give she and know she he must have a letter from she i can understand that it be agony to she but the matter be of such importance that one must passer pardessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment il y va du bonheur et de l’existence d’anne et de ses enfants i will not speak of myself though it ’ hard for i very hard  he say with an expression as though he be threaten someone for its be hard for he  and so it be princess that i be shamelessly clutch at you as an anchor of salvation help i to persuade she to write to he and ask for a divorce   yes of course  darya alexandrovna say dreamily as she vividly recall her last interview with alexey alexandrovitch  yes of course  she repeat with decision think of anna  use your influence with she make she write i do not like — i’m almost unable to speak about this to she   very well i will talk to she but how be it she do not think of it herself  say darya alexandrovna and for some reason she suddenly at that point recall anna ’s strange new habit of halfclose her eye and she remember that anna droop her eyelid just when the deep question of life be touch upon  just as though she halfshut her eye to her own life so as not to see everything  think dolly  yes indeed for my own sake and for hers i will talk to she  dolly say in reply to his look of gratitude they get up and walk to the house when anna find dolly at home before she she look intently in her eye as though question she about the talk she have have with vronsky but she make no inquiry in word  i believe it ’ dinner time  she say  we ’ve not see each other at all yet i be reckon on the evening now i want to go and dress i expect you do too we all get splash at the building  dolly go to her room and she feel amused to change her dress be impossible for she have already put on her good dress but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner she ask the maid to brush her dress change her cuff and tie and put some lace on her head  this be all i can do  she say with a smile to anna who come in to she in a third dress again of extreme simplicity  yes we be too formal here  she say as it be apologize for her magnificence  alexey be delighted at your visit as he rarely be at anything he have completely lose his heart to you  she add  you ’re not tired  there be no time for talk about anything before dinner go into the drawingroom they find princess varvara already there and the gentleman of the party in black frockcoat the architect wear a swallowtail coat vronsky present the doctor and the steward to his guest the architect he have already introduce to she at the hospital a stout butler resplendent with a smoothly shave round chin and a starched white cravat announce that dinner be ready and the lady get up vronsky ask sviazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna and himself offer his arm to dolly veslovsky be before tushkevitch in offer his arm to princess varvara so that tushkevitch with the steward and the doctor walk in alone the dinner the diningroom the service the waiting at table the wine and the food be not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout all the house but seem even more sumptuous and modern darya alexandrovna watch this luxury which be novel to she and as a good housekeeper use to manage a household — although she never dream of adapt anything she see to her own household as it be all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living — she could not help scrutinize every detail and wonder how and by whom it be all do vassenka veslovsky her husband and even sviazhsky and many other people she know would never have consider this question and would have readily believe what every wellbred host try to make his guest feel that be that all that be wellordered in his house have cost he the host no trouble whatever but come of itself darya alexandrovna be well aware that even porridge for the child ’s breakfast do not come of itself and that therefore where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury be maintain someone must give earnest attention to its organization and from the glance with which alexey kirillovitch scan the table from the way he nod to the butler and offer darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup she see that it be all organize and maintain by the care of the master of the house himself it be evident that it all rest no more upon anna than upon veslovsky she sviazhsky the princess and veslovsky be equally guest with light heart enjoy what have be arrange for they anna be the hostess only in conduct the conversation the conversation be a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with person present like the steward and the architect belong to a completely different world struggle not to be overawe by an elegance to which they be unaccustomed and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation but this difficult conversation anna direct with her usual tact and naturalness and indeed she do so with actual enjoyment as darya alexandrovna observe the conversation begin about the row tushkevitch and veslovsky have take alone together in the boat and tushkevitch begin describe the last boat race in petersburg at the yacht club but anna seize the first pause at once turn to the architect to draw he out of his silence  nikolay ivanitch be strike  she say mean sviazhsky  at the progress the new building have make since he be here last but i be there every day and every day i wonder at the rate at which it grow   it ’ firstrate work with his excellency  say the architect with a smile he be respectful and composed though with a sense of his own dignity  it ’ a very different matter to have to do with the district authority where one would have to write out sheaf of paper here i call upon the count and in three word we settle the business   the american way of do business  say sviazhsky with a smile  yes there they build in a rational fashion  the conversation pass to the misuse of political power in the united states but anna quickly bring it round to another topic so as to draw the steward into talk  have you ever see a reaping machine  she say address darya alexandrovna  we have just ride over to look at one when we meet it ’ the first time i ever see one   how do they work  ask dolly  exactly like little scissor a plank and a lot of little scissor like this  anna take a knife and fork in her beautiful white hand cover with ring and begin show how the machine work it be clear that she see nothing would be understand from her explanation but aware that her talk be pleasant and her hand beautiful she go on explain  more like little penknife  veslovsky say playfully never take his eye off she anna give a just perceptible smile but make no answer  be not it true karl fedoritch that it ’ just like little scissor  she say to the steward  oh ja  answer the german  es ist ein ganz einfaches ding  and he begin to explain the construction of the machine  it ’ a pity it do not bind too i see one at the vienna exhibition which bind with a wire  say sviazhsky  they would be more profitable in use   es kommt drauf an der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden  and the german rouse from his taciturnity turn to vronsky  das lässt sich ausrechnen erlaucht  the german be just feel in the pocket where be his pencil and the notebook he always write in but recollect that he be at a dinner and observe vronsky ’s chilly glance he check himself  zu compliziert macht zu viel klopot  he conclude  wünscht man dochots so hat man auch klopots  say vassenka veslovsky mimic the german  j’adore l’allemand  he address anna again with the same smile  cessez  she say with playful severity  we expect to find you in the field vassily semyonitch  she say to the doctor a sicklylooking man  have you be there   i go there but i have take flight  the doctor answer with gloomy jocoseness  then you ’ve take a good constitutional   splendid   well and how be the old woman i hope it ’ not typhus   typhus it be not but it ’ take a bad turn   what a pity  say anna and have thus pay the due of civility to her domestic circle she turn to her own friend  it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna  sviazhsky say jestingly  oh no why so  say anna with a smile that betray that she know there be something charming in her disquisition upon the machine that have be notice by sviazhsky this new trait of girlish coquettishness make an unpleasant impression on dolly  but anna arkadyevna ’s knowledge of architecture be marvelous  say tushkevitch  to be sure i hear anna arkadyevna talk yesterday about plinth and dampcourse  say veslovsky  have i get it right   there ’ nothing marvelous about it when one see and hear so much of it  say anna  but i dare say you do not even know what house be make of  darya alexandrovna see that anna dislike the tone of raillery that exist between she and veslovsky but fall in with it against her will vronsky act in this matter quite differently from levin he obviously attach no significance to veslovsky ’s chattering on the contrary he encourage his jest  come now tell we veslovsky how be the stone hold together   by cement of course   bravo and what be cement   oh some sort of paste   no putty  say veslovsky raise a general laugh the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remain plunge in gloomy silence keep up a conversation that never pause glance off one subject fasten on another and at time sting one or the other to the quick once darya alexandrovna feel wounded to the quick and get so hot that she positively flush and wonder afterwards whether she have say anything extreme or unpleasant sviazhsky begin talk of levin describe his strange view that machinery be simply pernicious in its effect on russian agriculture  i have not the pleasure of know this m levin  vronsky say smile  but most likely he have never see the machine he condemn or if he have see and try any it must have be after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of view can anyone have on such a subject   turkish view in general  veslovsky say turn to anna with a smile  i can not defend his opinion  darya alexandrovna say fire up  but i can say that he ’ a highly cultivate man and if he be here he would know very well how to answer you though i be not capable of do so   i like he extremely and we be great friend  sviazhsky say smile goodnaturedly  mais pardon il est un petit peu toqué he maintain for instance that district council and arbitration board be all of no use and he be unwilling to take part in anything   it ’ our russian apathy  say vronsky pour water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem  we ’ve no sense of the duty our privilege impose upon we and so we refuse to recognize these duty   i know no man more strict in the performance of his duty  say darya alexandrovna irritated by vronsky ’s tone of superiority  for my part  pursue vronsky who be evidently for some reason or other keenly affect by this conversation  such as i be i be on the contrary extremely grateful for the honor they have do i thank to nikolay ivanitch  he indicate sviazhsky  in elect i a justice of the peace i consider that for i the duty of be present at the session of judge some peasant  quarrel about a horse be as important as anything i can do and i shall regard it as an honor if they elect i for the district council it ’ only in that way i can pay for the advantage i enjoy as a landowner unluckily they do not understand the weight that the big landowner ought to have in the state  it be strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he be of be right at his own table she think how levin who believe the opposite be just as positive in his opinion at his own table but she love levin and so she be on his side  so we can reckon upon you count for the come election  say sviazhsky  but you must come a little beforehand so as to be on the spot by the eighth if you would do i the honor to stop with i   i rather agree with your beaufrère  say anna  though not quite on the same ground as he  she add with a smile  i ’m afraid that we have too many of these public duty in these latter day just as in old day there be so many government functionary that one have to call in a functionary for every single thing so now everyone ’ do some sort of public duty alexey have be here now six month and he ’ a member i do believe of five or six different public body du train que cela va the whole time will be waste on it and i ’m afraid that with such a multiplicity of these body they ’ll end in be a mere form how many be you a member of nikolay ivanitch  she turn to sviazhsky—“over twenty i fancy  anna speak lightly but irritation could be discern in her tone darya alexandrovna watch anna and vronsky attentively detect it instantly she notice too that as she speak vronsky ’s face have immediately take a serious and obstinate expression notice this and that princess varvara at once make haste to change the conversation by talk of petersburg acquaintance and remember what vronsky have without apparent connection say in the garden of his work in the country dolly surmise that this question of public activity be connect with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky the dinner the wine the decoration of the table be all very good but it be all like what darya alexandrovna have see at formal dinner and ball which of late year have become quite unfamiliar to she it all have the same impersonal and constrained character and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friend it make a disagreeable impression on she after dinner they sit on the terrace then they proceed to play lawn tennis the player divide into two party stand on opposite side of a tightly draw net with gilt pole on the carefully level and roll croquetground darya alexandrovna make an attempt to play but it be a long time before she could understand the game and by the time she do understand it she be so tired that she sit down with princess varvara and simply look on at the player her partner tushkevitch give up play too but the other keep the game up for a long time sviazhsky and vronsky both play very well and seriously they keep a sharp lookout on the ball serve to they and without haste or get in each other ’s way they run adroitly up to they wait for the rebound and neatly and accurately return they over the net veslovsky play worse than the other he be too eager but he keep the player lively with his high spirit his laughter and outcry never pause like the other man of the party with the lady  permission he take off his coat and his solid comely figure in his white shirtsleeve with his red perspire face and his impulsive movement make a picture that imprint itself vividly on the memory when darya alexandrovna lie in bed that night as soon as she close her eye she see vassenka veslovsky fly about the croquet ground during the game darya alexandrovna be not enjoy herself she do not like the light tone of raillery that be keep up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna and the unnaturalness altogether of grownup people all alone without child play at a child ’s game but to avoid break up the party and to get through the time somehow after a rest she join the game again and pretend to be enjoy it all that day it seem to she as though she be act in a theater with actor clever than she and that her bad acting be spoil the whole performance she have come with the intention of stay two day if all go well but in the evening during the game she make up her mind that she would go home next day the maternal care and worry which she have so hate on the way now after a day spend without they strike she in quite another light and tempt she back to they when after evening tea and a row by night in the boat darya alexandrovna go alone to her room take off her dress and begin arrange her thin hair for the night she have a great sense of relief it be positively disagreeable to she to think that anna be come to see she immediately she long to be alone with her own thought dolly be want to go to bed when anna come in to see she attire for the night in the course of the day anna have several time begin to speak of matter near her heart and every time after a few word she have stop  afterwards by ourselves we ’ll talk about everything i ’ve get so much i want to tell you  she say now they be by themselves and anna do not know what to talk about she sit in the window look at dolly and go over in her own mind all the store of intimate talk which have

the truth dolly be not she angry with i   angry oh no  say darya alexandrovna smile  but she hate i despise i   oh no but you know that sort of thing be not forgive   yes yes  say anna turn away and look out of the open window  but i be not to blame and who be to blame what ’ the meaning of be to blame could it have be otherwise what do you think could it possibly have happen that you do not

dolly do not know what to call he she feel it awkward to call he either the count or alexey kirillovitch  with alexey  say anna  i know what you talk about but i want to ask you directly what you think of i of my life   how be i to say like that straight off i really do not know   no tell i all the same you see my life but you must not forget that you ’re see we in the summer when you have come to we and we be not alone but we come here early in the spring live quite alone and shall be alone again and i desire nothing well but imagine i live alone without he alone and that will be   i see by everything that it will often be repeat that he will be half the time away from home  she say get up and sit down close by dolly  of course  she interrupt dolly who would have answer  of course i will not try to keep he by force i do not keep he indeed the race be just come his horse be run he will go i ’m very glad but think of i fancy my position but what ’ the use of talk about it  she smile  well what do he talk about with you   he speak of what i want to speak about of myself and it ’ easy for i to be his advocate of whether there be not a possibility   whether you could not  darya alexandrovna hesitate  correct improve your position you know how i look at it but all the same if possible you should get marry   divorce you mean  say anna  do you know the only woman who come to see i in petersburg be betsy tverskaya you know she of course au fond c’est la femme la plus depravée qui existe she have an intrigue with tushkevitch deceive her husband in the base way and she tell i that she do not care to know i so long as my position be irregular do not imagine i would compare   i know you darling but i could not help remember well so what do he say to you  she repeat  he say that he be unhappy on your account and his own perhaps you will say that it ’ egoism but what a legitimate and noble egoism he want first of all to legitimize his daughter and to be your husband to have a legal right to you   what wife what slave can be so utterly a slave as i in my position  she put in gloomily  the chief thing he desire   he desire that you should not suffer   that ’ impossible well   well and the most legitimate desire — he wish that your child should have a name   what child  anna say not look at dolly and half close her eye  annie and those to come   he need not trouble on that score i shall have no more child   how can you tell that you will not   i shall not because i do not wish it  and in spite of all her emotion anna smile as she catch the naïve expression of curiosity wonder and horror on dolly ’s face  the doctor tell i after my illness   impossible  say dolly open her eye wide for she this be one of those discovery the consequence and deduction from which be so immense that all that one feel for the first instant be that it be impossible to take it all in and that one will have to reflect a great great deal upon it this discovery suddenly throw light on all those family of one or two child which have hitherto be so incomprehensible to she arouse so many idea reflection and contradictory emotion that she have nothing to say and simply gaze with wideopen eye of wonder at anna this be the very thing she have be dream of but now learn that it be possible she be horrified she feel that it be too simple a solution of too complicated a problem  n’estce pas immoral  be all she say after a brief pause  why so think i have a choice between two alternative either to be with child that be an invalid or to be the friend and companion of my husband — practically my husband  anna say in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous  yes yes  say darya alexandrovna hear the very argument she have use to herself and not find the same force in they as before  for you for other people  say anna as though divine her thought  there may be reason to hesitate but for i you must consider i be not his wife he love i as long as he love i and how be i to keep his love not like this  she move her white hand in a curve before her waist with extraordinary rapidity as happen during moment of excitement idea and memory rush into darya alexandrovna ’s head  i  she think  do not keep my attraction for stiva he leave i for other and the first woman for whom he betray i do not keep he by be always pretty and lively he desert she and take another and can anna attract and keep count vronsky in that way if that be what he look for he will find dress and manner still more attractive and charming and however white and beautiful her bare arm be however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curl he will find something well still just as my disgusting pitiful and charming husband do  dolly make no answer she merely sigh anna notice this sigh indicate dissent and she go on in her armory she have other argument so strong that no answer could be make to they  do you say that it ’ not right but you must consider  she go on  you forget my position how can i desire child i ’m not speak of the suffering i ’m not afraid of that think only what be my child to be illfate child who will have to bear a stranger ’s name for the very fact of their birth they will be force to be ashamed of their mother their father their birth   but that be just why a divorce be necessary  but anna do not hear she she long to give utterance to all the argument with which she have so many time convince herself  what be reason give i for if i be not to use it to avoid bring unhappy being into the world  she look at dolly but without wait for a reply she go on  i should always feel i have wrong these unhappy child  she say  if they be not at any rate they be not unhappy while if they be unhappy i alone should be to blame for it  these be the very argument darya alexandrovna have use in her own reflection but she hear they without understand they  how can one wrong creature that do not exist  she think and all at once the idea strike she could it possibly under any circumstance have be well for her favorite grisha if he have never exist and this seem to she so wild so strange that she shake her head to drive away this tangle of whirl mad idea  no i do not know it ’ not right  be all she say with an expression of disgust on her face  yes but you must not forget that you and i and besides that  add anna in spite of the wealth of her argument and the poverty of dolly ’s objection seem still to admit that it be not right  do not forget the chief point that i be not now in the same position as you for you the question be do you desire not to have any more child while for i it be do i desire to have they and that ’ a great difference you must see that i can not desire it in my position  darya alexandrovna make no reply she suddenly feel that she have get far away from anna that there lie between they a barrier of question on which they could never agree and about which it be well not to speak  then there be all the more reason for you to legalize your position if possible  say dolly  yes if possible  say anna speak all at once in an utterly different tone subdued and mournful  surely you do not mean a divorce be impossible i be tell your husband have consent to it   dolly i do not want to talk about that   oh we will not then  darya alexandrovna hasten to say notice the expression of suffering on anna ’s face  all i see be that you take too gloomy a view of thing   i not at all i ’m always bright and happy you see je fais des passions veslovsky   yes to tell the truth i do not like veslovsky ’s tone  say darya alexandrovna anxious to change the subject  oh that ’ nonsense it amuse alexey and that ’ all but he ’ a boy and quite under my control you know i turn he as i please it ’ just as it might be with your grisha dolly”—she suddenly change the subject—“you say i take too gloomy a view of thing you can not understand it ’ too awful i try not to take any view of it at all   but i think you ought to you ought to do all you can   but what can i do nothing you tell i to marry alexey and say i do not think about it i do not think about it  she repeat and a flush rise into her face she get up straighten her chest and sigh heavily with her light step she begin pace up and down the room stop now and then  i do not think of it not a day not an hour pass that i do not think of it and blame myself for think of it   because think of that may drive i mad drive i mad  she repeat  when i think of it i can not sleep without morphine but never mind let we talk quietly they tell i divorce in the first place he will not give i a divorce he ’ under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now  darya alexandrovna sit erect on a chair turn her head follow anna with a face of sympathetic suffering  you ought to make the attempt  she say softly  suppose i make the attempt what do it mean  she say evidently give utterance to a thought a thousand time think over and learn by heart  it mean that i hate he but still recognize that i have wrong he — and i consider he magnanimous — that i humiliate myself to write to he well suppose i make the effort i do it either i receive a humiliating refusal or consent well i have receive his consent say  anna be at that moment at the furth end of the room and she stop there do something to the curtain at the window  i receive his consent but my   my son they will not give he up to i he will grow up despise i with his father whom i ’ve abandon do you see i love   equally i think but both more than myself — two creature seryozha and alexey  she come out into the middle of the room and stand face dolly with her arm press tightly across her chest in her white dressing gown her figure seem more than usually grand and broad she bend her head and with shining wet eye look from under her brow at dolly a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap shake all over with emotion  it be only those two creature that i love and one exclude the other i can not have they together and that ’ the only thing i want and since i can not have that i do not care about the rest i do not care about anything anything and it will end one way or another and so i can not i do not like to talk of it so do not blame i do not judge i for anything you can not with your pure heart understand all that i ’m suffer  she go up sit down beside dolly and with a guilty look peep into her face and take her hand  what be you think what be you think about i do n’t despise i i do not deserve contempt i ’m simply unhappy if anyone be unhappy i be  she articulate and turn away she burst into tear leave alone darya alexandrovna say her prayer and go to bed she have feel for anna with all her heart while she be speak to she but now she could not force herself to think of she the memory of home and of her child rise up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to she with a sort of new brilliance that world of her own seem to she now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she make up her mind that she would certainly go back next day anna meantime go back to her boudoir take a wineglass and drop into it several drop of a medicine of which the principal ingredient be morphine after drink it off and sit still a little while she go into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind when she go into the bedroom vronsky look intently at she he be look for trace of the conversation which he know that stay so long in dolly ’s room she must have have with she but in her expression of restrained excitement and of a sort of reserve he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitch he afresh though he be used to it the consciousness of it and the desire that it should affect he he do not want to ask she what they have be talk of but he hope that she would tell he something of her own accord but she only say  i be so glad you like dolly you do do not you   oh i ’ve know she a long while you know she ’ very goodhearted i suppose mais excessivement terreàterre still i ’m very glad to see she  he take anna ’s hand and look inquiringly into her eye misinterpret the look she smile to he next morning in spite of the protest of her host darya alexandrovna prepare for her homeward journey levin ’s coachman in his by no means new coat and shabby hat with his illmatched horse and his coach with the patched mudguard drive with gloomy determination into the cover gravel approach darya alexandrovna dislike take leave of princess varvara and the gentleman of the party after a day spend together both she and her host be distinctly aware that they do not get on together and that it be well for they not to meet only anna be sad she know that now from dolly ’s departure no one again would stir up within her soul the feeling that have be rouse by their conversation it hurt she to stir up these feeling but yet she know that that be the good part of her soul and that that part of her soul would quickly be smother in the life she be lead as she drive out into the open country darya alexandrovna have a delightful sense of relief and she feel tempt to ask the two man how they have like be at vronsky ’s when suddenly the coachman philip express himself unasked  roll in wealth they may be but three pot of oats be all they give we everything clear up till there be not a grain leave by cockcrow what be three pot a mere mouthful and oats now down to fortyfive kopeck at our place no fear all comer may have as much as they can eat   the master ’ a screw  put in the countinghouse clerk  well do you like their horse  ask dolly  the horse — there ’ no two opinion about they and the food be good but it seem to i sort of dreary there darya alexandrovna i do not know what you think  he say turn his handsome goodnatured face to she  i think so too well shall we get home by evening   eh we must  on reach home and find everyone entirely satisfactory and particularly charming darya alexandrovna begin with great liveliness tell they how she have arrive how warmly they have receive she of the luxury and good taste in which the vronskys live and of their recreation and she would not allow a word to be say against they  one have to know anna and vronsky — i have get to know he well now — to see how nice they be and how touching  she say speak now with perfect sincerity and forget the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she have experience there vronsky and anna spend the whole summer and part of the winter in the country live in just the same condition and still take no step to obtain a divorce it be an understand thing between they that they should not go away anywhere but both feel the long they live alone especially in the autumn without guest in the house that they could not stand this existence and that they would have to alter it their life be apparently such that nothing well could be desire they have the full abundance of everything they have a child and both have occupation anna devote just as much care to her appearance when they have no visitor and she do a great deal of read both of novel and of what serious literature be in fashion she order all the book that be praise in the foreign paper and review she receive and read they with that concentrated attention which be only give to what be read in seclusion moreover every subject that be of interest to vronsky she study in book and special journal so that he often go straight to she with question relate to agriculture or architecture sometimes even with question relate to horsebreeding or sport he be amazed at her knowledge her memory and at first be disposed to doubt it to ask for confirmation of her fact and she would find what he ask for in some book and show it to he the building of the hospital too interest she she do not merely assist but plan and suggest a great deal herself but her chief thought be still of herself — how far she be dear to vronsky how far she could make up to he for all he have give up vronsky appreciate this desire not only to please but to serve he which have become the sole aim of her existence but at the same time he weary of the love snare in which she try to hold he fast as time go on and he see himself more and more often hold fast in these snare he have an ever grow desire not so much to escape from they as to try whether they hinder his freedom have it not be for this grow desire to be free not to have scene every time he want to go to the town to a meeting or a race vronsky would have be perfectly satisfied with his life the rôle he have take up the rôle of a wealthy landowner one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the russian aristocracy be entirely to his taste and now after spend six month in that character he derive even great satisfaction from it and his management of his estate which occupy and absorb he more and more be most successful in spite of the immense sum cost he by the hospital by machinery by cow order from switzerland and many other thing he be convince that he be not waste but increase his substance in all matter affect income the sale of timber wheat and wool the letting of land vronsky be hard as a rock and know well how to keep up price in all operation on a large scale on this and his other estate he keep to the simple method involve no risk and in trifling detail he be careful and exacting to an extreme degree in spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the german steward who would try to tempt he into purchase by make his original estimate always far large than really require and then represent to vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper and so make a profit vronsky do not give in he listen to his steward crossexamined he and only agree to his suggestion when the implement to be order or construct be the very new not yet know in russia and likely to excite wonder apart from such exception he resolve upon an increase outlay only where there be a surplus and in make such an outlay he go into the minute detail and insist on get the very good for his money so that by the method on which he manage his affair it be clear that he be not waste but increase his substance in october there be the provincial election in the kashinsky province where be the estate of vronsky sviazhsky koznishev oblonsky and a small part of levin ’s land these election be attract public attention from several circumstance connect with they

vronsky with a hard and cold expression inform anna of his departure as he have never speak to she before but to his surprise anna accept the information with great composure and merely ask when he would be back he look intently at she at a loss to explain this composure she smile at his look he know that way she have of withdraw into herself and know that it only happen when she have determine upon something without let he know her plan he be afraid of this but he be so anxious to avoid a scene that he keep up appearance and half sincerely believe in what he long to believe in — her reasonableness  i hope you will not be dull   i hope not  say anna  i get a box of book yesterday from gautier ’s no i shall not be dull   she ’ try to take that tone and so much the well  he think  or else it would be the same thing over and over again  and he set off for the election without appeal to she for a candid explanation it be the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he have part from she without a full explanation from one point of view this trouble he but on the other side he feel that it be well so  at first there will be as this time something undefined keep back and then she will get used to it in any case i can give up anything for she but not my masculine independence  he think in september levin move to moscow for kitty ’s confinement he have spend a

that depend upon the court of wardship the other matter the payment of the sum due be meet too by difficulty after long negotiation over the legal detail the money be at last ready to be pay but the notary a most obliging person could not hand over the order because it must have the signature of the president and the president though he have not give over his duty to a deputy be at the election all these worrying negotiation this endless go from place to place and talk with pleasant and excellent people who quite see the unpleasantness of the petitioner ’s position but be powerless to assist he — all these effort that yield no result lead to a feeling of misery in levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experience in dream when one try to use physical force he feel this frequently as he talk to his most goodnatured solicitor this solicitor do it seem everything possible and strain every nerve to get he out of his difficulty  i tell you what you might try  he say more than once  go to soandso and soandso  and the solicitor draw up a regular plan for get round the fatal point that hinder everything but he would add immediately  it ’ll mean some delay anyway but you might try it  and levin do try and do go everyone be kind and civil but the point evade seem to crop up again in the end and again to bar the way what be particularly try be that levin could not make out with whom he be struggle to whose interest it be that his business should not be do that no one seem to know the solicitor certainly do not know if levin could have understand why just as he see why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file it would not have be so vexatious and tiresome to he but with the hindrance that confront he in his business no one could explain why they exist but levin have change a good deal since his marriage he be patient and if he could not see why it be all arrange like this he tell himself that he could not judge without know all about it and that most likely it must be so and he try not to fret in attend the election too and take part in they he try now not to judge not to fall foul of they but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which be so earnestly and ardently absorb honest and excellent man whom he respect since his marriage there have be reveal to levin so many new and serious aspect of life that have previously through his frivolous attitude to they seem of no importance that in the question of the election too he assume and try to find some serious significance sergey ivanovitch explain to he the meaning and object of the propose revolution at the election the marshal of the province in whose hand the law have place the control of so many important public function — the guardianship of ward the very department which be give levin so much trouble just now the disposal of large sum subscribe by the nobility of the province the high school female male and military and popular instruction on the new model and finally the district council — the marshal of the province snetkov be a nobleman of the old school — dissipate an immense fortune a goodhearted man honest after his own fashion but utterly without any comprehension of the need of modern day he always take in every question the side of the nobility he be positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education and he succeed in give a purely party character to the district council which ought by right to be of such an immense importance what be need be to put in his place a fresh capable perfectly modern man of contemporary idea and to frame their policy so as from the right confer upon the noble not as the nobility but as an element of the district council to extract all the power of selfgovernment that could possibly be derive from they in the wealthy kashinsky province which always take the lead of other province in everything there be now such a preponderance of force that this policy once carry through properly there might serve as a model for other province for all russia and hence the whole question be of the great importance it be propose to elect as marshal in place of snetkov either sviazhsky or well still nevyedovsky a former university professor a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of sergey ivanovitch the meeting be open by the governor who make a speech to the noble urge they to elect the public functionary not from regard for person but for the service and welfare of their fatherland and hope that the honorable nobility of the kashinsky province would as at all former election hold their duty as sacred and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch when he have finish with his speech the governor walk out of the hall and the nobleman noisily and eagerly — some even enthusiastically — follow he and throng round he while he put on his fur coat and converse amicably with the marshal of the province levin anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything stand there too in the crowd and hear the governor say  please tell marya ivanovna my wife be very sorry she could not come to the home  and thereupon the noble in high goodhumor sort out their fur coat and all drive off to the cathedral in the cathedral levin lift his hand like the rest and repeat the word of the archdeacon swear with most terrible oath to do all the governor have hope they would do church service always affect levin and as he utter the word  i kiss the cross  and glance round at the crowd of young and old man repeat the same he feel touch on the second and third day there be business relate to the finance of the nobility and the female high school of no importance whatever as sergey ivanovitch explain and levin busy see after his own affair do not attend the meeting on the fourth day the auditing of the marshal ’s account take place at the high table of the marshal of the province and then there occur the first skirmish between the new party and the old the committee who have be depute to verify the account report to the meeting that all be in order the marshal of the province get up thank the nobility for their confidence and shed tear the noble give he a loud welcome and shake hand with he but at that instant a nobleman of sergey ivanovitch ’s party say that he have hear that the committee have not verify the account consider such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province one of the member of the committee incautiously admit this then a small gentleman very younglooking but very malignant begin to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditure of the public money and that the misplaced delicacy of the member of the committee be deprive he of this moral satisfaction then the member of the committee try to withdraw their admission and sergey ivanovitch begin to prove that they must logically admit either that they have verify the account or that they have not and he develop this dilemma in detail sergey ivanovitch be answer by the spokesman of the opposite party then sviazhsky speak and then the malignant gentleman again the discussion last a long time and end in nothing levin be surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long especially as when he ask sergey ivanovitch whether he suppose that money have be misappropriate sergey ivanovitch answer  oh no he ’ an honest man but those oldfashioned method of paternal family arrangement in the management of provincial affair must be break down  on the fifth day come the election of the district marshal it be rather a stormy day in several district in the seleznevsky district sviazhsky be elect unanimously without a ballot and he give a dinner that evening the sixth day be fix for the election of the marshal of the province the room large and small be full of nobleman in all sort of uniform many have come only for that day man who have not see each other for year some from the crimea some from petersburg some from abroad meet in the room of the hall of nobility there be much discussion around the governor ’s table under the portrait of the tsar the noble both in the large and the small room group themselves in camp and from their hostile and suspicious glance from the silence that fall upon they when outsider approach a group and from the way that some whisper together retreat to the farth corridor it be evident that each side have secret from the other in appearance the nobleman be sharply divide into two class the old and the new the old be for the most part either in old uniform of the nobility button up closely with spur and hat or in their own special naval cavalry infantry or official uniform the uniform of the old man be embroider in the oldfashioned way with epaulet on their shoulder they be unmistakably tight and short in the waist as though their wearer have grow out of they the young man wear the uniform of the nobility with long waist and broad shoulder unbuttoned over white waistcoat or uniform with black collar and with the embroider badge of justice of the peace to the young man belong the court uniform that here and there brighten up the crowd but the division into young and old do not correspond with the division of party some of the young man as levin observe belong to the old party and some of the very old nobleman on the contrary be whisper with sviazhsky and be evidently ardent partisan of the new party levin stand in the small room where they be smoke and take light refreshment close to his own friend and listen to what they be say he conscientiously exert all his intelligence try to understand what be say sergey ivanovitch be the center round which the other group themselves he be listen at that moment to sviazhsky and hliustov the marshal of another district who belong to their party hliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask snetkov to stand while sviazhsky be persuade he to do so and sergey ivanovitch be approve of the plan levin could not make out why the opposition be to ask the marshal to stand whom they want to supersede stepan arkadyevitch who have just be drink and take some lunch come up to they in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber wipe his lip with a perfumed handkerchief of border batiste  we be place our force  he say pull out his whisker  sergey ivanovitch  and listen to the conversation he support sviazhsky ’s contention  one district ’ enough and sviazhsky ’ obviously of the opposition  he say word evidently intelligible to all except levin  why kostya you here too i suppose you ’re convert eh  he add turn to levin and draw his arm through his levin would have be glad indeed to be convert but could not make out what the point be and retreat a few step from the speaker he explain to stepan arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be ask to stand  o sancta simplicitas  say stepan arkadyevitch and briefly and clearly he explain it to levin if as at previous election all the district ask the marshal of the province to stand then he would be elect without a ballot that must not be now eight district have agree to call upon he if two refuse to do so snetkov might decline to stand at all and then the old party might choose another of their party which would throw they completely out in their reckoning but if only one district sviazhsky ’s do not call upon he to stand snetkov would let himself be ballot for they be even some of they go to vote for he and purposely to let he get a good many vote so that the enemy might be throw off the scent and when a candidate of the other side be put up they too might give he some vote levin understand to some extent but not fully and would have put a few more question when suddenly everyone begin talk and make a noise and they move towards the big room  what be it eh whom   no guarantee whose what   they will not pass he   no guarantee   they will not let flerov in   eh because of the charge against he   why at this rate they will not admit anyone it ’ a swindle   the law  levin hear exclamation on all side and he move into the big room together with the other all hurry somewhere and afraid of miss something squeeze by the crowd nobleman he draw near the high table where the marshal of the province sviazhsky and the other leader be hotly dispute about something levin be stand rather far off a nobleman breathe heavily and hoarsely at his side and another whose thick boot be creak prevent he from hear distinctly he could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman and then the voice of sviazhsky they be dispute as far as he could make out as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the word  liable to be call up for trial  the crowd part to make way for sergey ivanovitch approach the table sergey ivanovitch wait till the malignant gentleman have finish speak say that he think the good solution would be to refer to the act itself and ask the secretary to find the act the act say that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot sergey ivanovitch read the act and begin to explain its meaning but at that point a tall stout roundshouldered landowner with dye whisker in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck interrupt he he go up to the table and strike it with his finger ring he shout loudly  a ballot put it to the vote no need for more talking  then several voice begin to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the ring get more and more exasperated shout more and more loudly but it be impossible to make out what he say he be shout for the very course sergey ivanovitch have propose but it be evident that he hate he and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and rouse in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side shout be raise and for a moment all be confusion so that the marshal of the province have to call for order  a ballot a ballot every nobleman see it we shed our blood for our country the confidence of the monarch no check the account of the marshal he ’ not a cashier but that ’ not the point vote please beastly  shout furious and violent voice on all side look and face be even more violent and furious than their word they express the most implacable hatred levin do not in the least understand what be the matter and he marvel at the passion with which it be dispute whether or not the decision about flerov should be put to the vote he forget as sergey ivanovitch explain to he afterwards this syllogism that it be necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it be necessary to have a majority of vote that to get a majority of vote it be necessary to secure flerov ’s right to vote that to secure the recognition of flerov ’s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act  and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one want to be of use in public life  conclude sergey ivanovitch but levin forget all that and it be painful to he to see all these excellent person for whom he have a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement to escape from this painful feeling he go away into the other room where there be nobody except the waiter at the refreshment bar see the waiter busy over wash up the crockery and set in order their plate and wineglass see their calm and cheerful face levin feel an unexpected sense of relief as though he have come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air he begin walk up and down look with pleasure at the waiter he particularly like the way one graywhiskered waiter who show his scorn for the other young one and be jeer at by they be teach they how to fold up napkin properly levin be just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter when the secretary of the court of wardship a little old man whose specialty it be to know all the nobleman of the province by name and patronymic draw he away  please come konstantin dmitrievitch  he say  your brother ’ look for you they be vote on the legal point  levin walk into the room receive a white ball and follow his brother sergey ivanovitch to the table where sviazhsky be stand with a significant and ironical face hold his beard in his fist and sniff at it sergey ivanovitch put his hand into the box put the ball somewhere and make room for levin stop levin advance but utterly forget what he be to do and much embarrass he turn to sergey ivanovitch with the question  where be i to put it  he ask this softly at a moment when there be talking go on near so that he have hope his question would not be overhear but the person speak pause and his improper question be overhear sergey ivanovitch frown  that be a matter for each man ’s own decision  he say severely several people smile levin crimsoned hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth and put the ball to the right as it be in his right hand have put it in he recollect that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background  a hundred and twentysix for admission ninetyeight against  sing out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r then there be a laugh a button and two nut be find in the box the nobleman be allow the right to vote and the new party have conquer but the old party do not consider themselves conquer levin hear that they be ask snetkov to stand and he see that a crowd of nobleman be surround the marshal who be say something levin go near in reply snetkov speak of the trust the nobleman of the province have place in he the affection they have show he which he do not deserve as his only merit have be his attachment to the nobility to whom he have devote twelve year of service several time he repeat the word  i have serve to the good of my power with truth and good faith i value your goodness and thank you  and suddenly he stop short from the tear that choke he and go out of the room whether these tear come from a sense of the injustice be do he from his love for the nobility or from the strain of the position he be place in feel himself surround by enemy his emotion infect the assembly the majority be touch and levin feel a tenderness for snetkov in the doorway the marshal of the province jostle against levin  beg pardon excuse i please  he say as to a stranger but recognize levin he smile timidly it seem to levin that he would have like to say something but could not speak for emotion his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosse and white trouser stripe with braid as he move hurriedly along remind levin of some hunt beast who see that he be in evil case this expression in the marshal ’s face be particularly touching to levin because only the day before he have be at his house about his trustee business and have see he in all his grandeur a kindhearted fatherly man the big house with the old family furniture the rather dirty far from stylish but respectful footman unmistakably old house serf who have stick to their master the stout goodnatured wife in a cap with lace and a turkish shawl pet her pretty grandchild her daughter ’s daughter the young son a sixth form high school boy come home from school and greet his father kiss his big hand the genuine cordial word and gesture of the old man — all this have the day before rouse an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in levin this old man be a touching and pathetic figure to levin now and he long to say something pleasant to he  so you ’re sure to be our marshal again  he say  it ’ not likely  say the marshal look round with a scared expression  i ’m worn out i ’m old if there be man young and more deserving than i let they serve  and the marshal disappear through a side door the most solemn moment be at hand they be to proceed immediately to the election

partisan of snetkov and a third have be rob of his uniform on learn this the new party have make haste during the dispute about flerov to send some of their man in a sledge to clothe the strip gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting  i ’ve bring one drench he with water  say the landowner who have go on this errand to sviazhsky  he ’ all right he ’ll do   not too

other distraction in the interval some be lunch stand at the bar or sit at the table other be walk up and down the long room smoke cigarette and talk with friend whom they have not see for a long while levin do not care to eat and he be not smoke he do not want to join his own friend that be sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sviazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his equerry ’s uniform

group and listen to what be be say around he he feel depressed especially because everyone else be as he see eager anxious and interested and he alone with an old toothless little man with mumbling lip wear a naval uniform sit beside he have no interest in it and nothing to do  he ’ such a blackguard i have tell he so but it make no difference only think of it he could not collect it in three year  he hear vigorously utter by a roundshouldered short country gentleman who have pomade hair hang on his embroidered collar and new boot obviously put on for the occasion with heel that tap energetically as he speak cast a displeased glance at levin this gentleman sharply turn his back  yes it ’ a dirty business there ’ no deny  a small gentleman assent in a high voice next a whole crowd of country gentleman surround a stout general hurriedly come near levin these person be unmistakably seek a place where they could talk without be overhear  how dare he say i have his breech steal pawn they for drink i expect damn the fellow prince indeed he ’d well not say it the beast   but excuse i they take their stand on the act  be be say in another group  the wife must be register as

to take part in our coup d’état  he say confidently pronounce the french word with a bad accent  all russia ’s here — gentleman of the bedchamber and everything short of the ministry  he point to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevitch in white trouser and his court uniform walk by with a general  i ought to own that i do not very well understand the drift of the provincial election  say levin the landowner look at he  why what be there to understand there ’ no meaning in it at all it ’ a decay institution that go on run only by the force of inertia just look the very uniform tell you that it ’ an assembly of justice of the peace permanent member of the court and so on but not of nobleman   then why do you come  ask levin  from habit nothing else then too one must keep up connection it ’ a moral obligation of a sort and then to tell the truth there ’ one ’s own interest my soninlaw want to stand as a permanent member they ’re not rich people and he must be bring forward these gentleman now what do they come for  he say point to the malignant gentleman who be talk at the high table  that ’ the new generation of nobility   new it may be but nobility it be not they ’re proprietor of a sort but we ’re the landowner as nobleman they ’re cut their own throat   but you say it ’ an institution that ’ serve its time   that it may be but still it ought to be treat a little more respectfully snetkov now we may be of use or we may not but we ’re the growth of a thousand year if we ’re lay out a garden plan one before the house you know and there you ’ve a tree that ’ stand for century in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you do not cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbed but lay out your bed so as to take advantage of the tree you will not grow he again in a year  he say cautiously and he immediately change the conversation  well and how be your land do   oh not very well i make five per cent   yes but you do not reckon your own work be not you worth something too i ’ll tell you my own case before i take to see after the land i have a salary of three hundred pound from the service now i do more work than i do in the service and like you i get five per cent on the land and thank god for that but one ’s work be throw in for nothing   then why do you do it if it ’ a clear loss   oh well one do it what would you have it ’ habit and one know it ’ how it should be and what ’ more  the landowner go on lean his elbow on the window and chat on  my son i must tell you have no taste for it there ’ no doubt he ’ll be a scientific man so there ’ll be no one to keep it up and yet one do it here this year i ’ve plant an orchard   yes yes  say levin  that ’ perfectly true i always feel there ’ no real balance of gain in my work on the land and yet one do it it ’ a sort of duty one feel to the land   but i tell you what  the landowner pursue  a neighbor of mine a merchant be at my place we walk about the field and the garden  no  say he  stepan vassilievitch everything ’ well look after but your garden ’ neglect  but as a fact it ’ well keep up  to my thinking i ’d cut down that limetree here you ’ve thousand of lime and each would make two good bundle of bark and nowadays that bark ’ worth something i ’d cut down the lot    and with what he make he ’d increase his stock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out in lot to the peasant  levin add smile he have evidently more than once come across those commercial calculation  and he ’d make his fortune but you and i must thank god if we keep what we ’ve get and leave it to our child   you ’re married i ’ve hear  say the landowner  yes  levin answer with proud satisfaction  yes it ’ rather strange  he go on  so we live without make anything as though we be ancient vestal set to keep in a fire  the landowner chuckle under his white mustache  there be some among we too like our friend nikolay ivanovitch or count vronsky that ’ settle here lately who try to carry on their husbandry as though it be a factory but so far it lead to nothing but make away with capital on it   but why be it we do not do like the merchant why do not we cut down our park for timber  say levin return to a thought that have strike he  why as you say to keep the fire in besides that ’ not work for a nobleman and our work as nobleman be not do here at the election but yonder each in our corner there ’ a class instinct too of what one ought and ought not to do there ’ the peasant too i wonder at they sometimes any good peasant try to take all the land he can however bad the land be he ’ll work it without a return too at a simple loss   just as we do  say levin  very very glad to have meet you  he add see sviazhsky approach he  and here we ’ve meet for the first time since we meet at your place  say the landowner to sviazhsky  and we ’ve have a good talk too   well have you be attack the new order of thing  say sviazhsky with a smile  that we ’re bind to do   you ’ve relieve your feeling  sviazhsky take levin ’s arm and go with he to his own friend this time there be no avoid vronsky he be stand with stepan arkadyevitch and sergey ivanovitch and look straight at levin as he draw near  delighted i believe i ’ve have the pleasure of meet you   at princess shtcherbatskaya ’s  he say give levin his hand  yes i quite remember our meeting  say levin and blush crimson he turn away immediately and begin talk to his brother with a slight smile vronsky go on talk to sviazhsky obviously without the slight inclination to enter into conversation with levin but levin as he talk to his brother be continually look round at vronsky try to think of something to say to he to gloss over his rudeness  what be we wait for now  ask levin look at sviazhsky and vronsky  for snetkov he have to refuse or to consent to stand  answer sviazhsky  well and what have he do consent or not   that ’ the point that he ’ do neither  say vronsky  and if he refuse who will stand then  ask levin look at vronsky  whoever choose to  say sviazhsky  shall you  ask levin  certainly not i  say sviazhsky look confused and turn an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman who be stand beside sergey ivanovitch  who then nevyedovsky  say levin feel he be put his foot into it but this be bad still nevyedovsky and sviazhsky be the two candidate  i certainly shall not under any circumstance  answer the malignant gentleman this be nevyedovsky himself sviazhsky introduce he to levin  well you find it exciting too  say stepan arkadyevitch wink at vronsky  it ’ something like a race one might bet on it   yes it be keenly exciting  say vronsky  and once take the thing up one ’ eager to see it through it ’ a fight  he say scowl and set his powerful jaw  what a capable fellow sviazhsky be see it all so clearly   oh yes  vronsky assent indifferently a silence follow during which vronsky — since he have to look at something — look at levin at his foot at his uniform then at his face and notice his gloomy eye fix upon he he say in order to say something  how be it that you live constantly in the country be not a justice of the peace you be not in the uniform of one   it ’ because i consider that the justice of the peace be a silly institution  levin answer gloomily he have be all the time look for an opportunity to enter into conversation with vronsky so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting  i do not think so quite the contrary  vronsky say with quiet surprise  it ’ a plaything  levin cut he short  we do not want justice of the peace i ’ve never have a single thing to do with they during eight year and what i have have be decide wrongly by they the justice of the peace be over thirty mile from i for some matter of two rouble i should have to send a lawyer who cost i fifteen  and he relate how a peasant have steal some flour from the miller and when the miller tell he of it have lodge a complaint for slander all this be utterly uncalled for and stupid and levin feel it himself as he say it  oh this be such an original fellow  say stepan arkadyevitch with his most soothing almondoil smile  but come along i think they ’re vote  and they separate  i can not understand  say sergey ivanovitch who have observe his brother ’s clumsiness  i can not understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact that ’ where we russians be so deficient the marshal of the province be our opponent and with he you ’re ami cochon and you beg he to stand count vronsky now   i ’m not make a friend of he he ’ ask i to dinner and i ’m not go but he ’ one of our side — why make an enemy of he then you ask nevyedovsky if he ’ go to stand that ’ not a thing to do   oh i do not understand it at all and it ’ all such nonsense  levin answer gloomily  you say it ’ all such nonsense but as soon as you have anything to do with it you make a muddle  levin do not answer and they walk together into the big room the marshal of the province though he be vaguely conscious in the air of some trap be prepare for he and though he have not be call upon you all to stand have still make up his mind to stand all be silence in the room the secretary announce in a loud voice that the captain of the guard mihail stepanovitch snetkov would now be ballot for as marshal of the province the district marshal walk carry plate on which be ball from their table to the high table and the election begin  put it in the right side  whisper stepan arkadyevitch as with his brother levin follow the marshal of his district to the table but levin have forget by now the calculation that have be explain to he and be afraid stepan arkadyevitch might be mistaken in say  the right side  surely snetkov be the enemy as he go up he hold the ball in his right hand but think he be wrong just at the box he change to the left hand and undoubtedly put the ball to the left an adept in the business stand at the box and see by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball scowl with annoyance it be no good for he to use his insight everything be still and the counting of the ball be hear then a single voice rise and proclaim the number for and against the marshal have be vote for by a considerable you all be noise and eager movement towards the door snetkov come in and the noble throng round he congratulate he  well now be it over  levin ask sergey ivanovitch  it ’ only just begin  sviazhsky say reply for sergey ivanovitch with a smile  some other candidate may receive more vote than the marshal  levin have quite forget about that now he could only remember that there be some sort of trickery in it but he be too bored to think what it be exactly he feel depressed and long to get out of the crowd as no one be pay any attention to he and no one apparently need he he quietly slip away into the little room where the refreshment be and again have a great sense of comfort when he see the waiter the little old waiter press he to have something and levin agree after eat a cutlet with bean and talk to the waiter of their former master levin not wish to go back to the hall where it be all so distasteful to he proceed to walk through the gallery the gallery be full of fashionably dress lady lean over the balustrade and try not to lose a single word of what be be say below with the lady be sit and stand smart lawyer high school teacher in spectacle and officer everywhere they be talk of the election and of how worried the marshal be and how splendid the discussion have be in one group levin hear his brother ’s

post in the department of finance and be director of a flourish bank in kashin the excellent cook vronsky have bring from the country and his friendship with the governor who be a schoolfellow of vronsky’s — a schoolfellow he have patronize and protect indeed but what contribute more than all to his success be his direct equable manner with everyone which very quickly make the majority of the nobleman reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness he be himself conscious that except that whimsical gentleman marry to kitty shtcherbatskaya who have à propos de bottes pour out a

nickname in the page  corps — whom he feel to be shy and try to mettre à son aise on the left hand sit nevyedovsky with his youthful stubborn and malignant face with he vronsky be simple and deferential   sviazhsky take his failure very lightheartedly it be indeed no failure in his eye as he say himself turn glass in hand to nevyedovsky they could not have find a well representative of the new movement which the nobility ought to follow and so every honest person as he say be on the side of today ’s success and be rejoice over it   stepan arkadyevitch be glad too that he be have a

have be get up    there ’ll be a ball and you ’ll see the belle of the province worth see really     not in my line  vronsky answer he like that english phrase but he smile and promise to come   before they rise from the table when all of they be smoke vronsky ’s valet go up to he with a letter on a tray    from vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger  he say with a significant expression    astonishing how like he be to the deputy prosecutor sventitsky  say one of the guest in french of the valet while vronsky frown read the letter   the letter be from anna before he read the letter he know its content expect the election to be over in five day he have promise to be back on friday today be saturday and he know that the letter contain reproach for not be back at the time fix the letter he have send the previous evening have probably not reach she yet   the letter be what he have expect but the form of it be unexpected and particularly disagreeable to he  annie be very ill the doctor say it may be inflammation i be lose my head all alone princess varvara be no help but a hindrance i expect you the day before yesterday and yesterday and now i be send to find out where you be and what you be do i want to come myself but think well of it know you would dislike it send some answer that i may know what to do    the child ill yet she have think of come herself their daughter ill and this hostile tone   the innocent festivity over the election and this gloomy burdensome love to which he have to return strike vronsky by their contrast but he have to go and by the first train that night he set off home     before vronsky ’s departure for the election anna have reflect that the scene constantly repeat between they each time he leave home might only make he cold to she instead of attach he to she and resolve to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure but the cold severe glance with which he have look at she when he come to tell she he be go have wound she and before he have start her peace of mind be destroy   in solitude afterwards think over that glance which have express his right to freedom she come as she always do to the same point — the sense of her own humiliation  he have the right to go away when and where he choose not simply to go away but to leave i he have every right and i have none but know that he ought not to do it what have he do though he look at i with a cold severe expression of course that be something indefinable impalpable but it have never be so before and that glance mean a great deal  she think  that glance show the beginning of indifference    and though she feel sure that a coldness be begin there be nothing she could do she could not in any way alter her relation to he just as before only by love and by charm could she keep he and so just as before only by occupation in the day by morphine at night could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he cease to love she it be true there be still one mean not to keep he — for that she want nothing more than his love — but to be near to he to be in such a position that he would not leave she that means be divorce and marriage and she begin to long for that and make up her mind to agree to it the first time he or stiva approach she on the subject   absorb in such thought she pass five day without he the five day that he be to be at the election   walk conversation with princess varvara visit to the hospital and most of all reading — reading of one book after another — fill up her time but on the sixth day when the coachman come back without he she feel that now she be utterly incapable of stifle the thought of he and of what he be do there just at that time her little girl be take ill anna begin to look after she but even that do not distract her mind especially as the illness be not serious however hard she try she could not love this little child and to feign love be beyond her power towards the evening of that day still alone anna be in such a panic about he that she decide to start for the town but on second thought write he the contradictory letter that vronsky receive and without read it through send it off by a special messenger the next morning she receive his letter and regret her own she dread a repetition of the severe look he have fling at she at parting especially when he know that the baby be not dangerously ill but still she be glad she have write to he at this moment anna be positively admit to herself that she be a burden to he that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to she and in spite of that she be glad he be come let he weary of she but he would be here with she so that she would see he would know of every action he take   she be sit in the drawingroom near a lamp with a new volume of taine and as she read listen to the sound of the wind outside and every minute expect the carriage to arrive several time she have fancy she hear the sound of wheel but she have be mistake at last she hear not the sound of wheel but the coachman ’s shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry even princess varvara play patience confirm this and anna flush hotly get up but instead of go down as she have do twice before she stand still she suddenly feel ashamed of her duplicity but even more she dread how he might meet she all feeling of wounded pride have pass now she be only afraid of the expression of his displeasure she remember that her child have be perfectly well again for the last two day she feel positively vexed with she for get well from the very moment her letter be send off then she think of he that he be here all of he with his hand his eye she hear his voice and forget everything she run joyfully to meet he    well how be annie  he say timidly from below look up to anna as she run down to he   he be sit on a chair and a footman be pull off his warm overboot    oh she be well     and you  he say shake himself   she take his hand in both of hers and draw it to her waist never take her eye off he    well i ’m glad  he say coldly scan she her hair her dress which he know she have put on for he all be charming but how many time it have charm he and the stern stony expression that she so dread settle upon his face    well i ’m glad and be you well  he say wipe his damp beard with his handkerchief and kiss her hand    never mind  she think  only let he be here and so long as he ’ here he can not he dare not cease to love i    the evening be spend happily and gaily in the presence of princess varvara who complain to he that anna have be take morphine in his absence    what be i to do i could not sleep my thought prevent i when he ’ here i never take it — hardly ever    he tell she about the election and anna know how by adroit question to bring he to what give he most pleasure — his own success she tell he of everything that interest he at home and all that she tell he be of the most cheerful description   but late in the evening when they be alone anna see that she have regain complete possession of he want to erase the painful impression of the glance he have give she for her letter she say    tell i frankly you be vexed at get my letter and you do not believe i    as soon as she have say it she feel that however warm his feeling be to she he have not forgive she for that    yes  he say  the letter be so strange first annie ill and then you think of come yourself     it be all the truth     oh i do not doubt it     yes you do doubt it you be vexed i see     not for one moment i ’m only vexed that ’ true that you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there be duty     the duty of go to a concert     but we will not talk about it  he say    why not talk about it  she say    i only mean to say that matter of real importance may turn up now for instance i shall have to go to moscow to arrange about the house oh anna why be you so irritable do not you know that i can not live without you     if so  say anna her voice suddenly change  it mean that you be sick of this life yes you will come for a day and go away as man do     anna that ’ cruel i be ready to give up my whole life    but she do not hear he    if you go to moscow i will go too i will not stay here either we must separate or else live together     why you know that ’ my one desire but for that     we must get a divorce i will write to he i see i can not go on like this but i will come with you to moscow     you talk as if you be threaten i but i desire nothing so much as never to be part from you  say vronsky smile   but as he say these word there gleam in his eye not merely a cold look but the vindictive look of a man persecute and make cruel   she see the look and correctly divine its meaning    if so it ’ a calamity  that glance tell she it be a moment ’s impression but she never forget it   anna write to her husband ask he about a divorce and towards the end of november take leave of princess varvara who want to go to petersburg she go with vronsky to moscow expect every day an answer from alexey alexandrovitch and after that the divorce they now establish themselves together like married people
