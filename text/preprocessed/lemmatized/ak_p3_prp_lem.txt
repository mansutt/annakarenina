 sergey ivanovitch koznishev want a rest from mental work and instead of go abroad as he usually do he come towards the end of may to stay in the country with his brother in his judgment the good sort of life be a country life he have come now to enjoy such a life at his brother ’s konstantin levin be very glad to have he especially as he do not expect his brother nikolay that summer but in spite of his affection and respect for sergey ivanovitch konstantin levin be uncomfortable with his brother in the country it make he uncomfortable and it positively annoy he to see his brother ’s attitude to the country to konstantin levin the country be the background of life that is of pleasure endeavor labor to sergey ivanovitch the country mean on one hand rest from work on the other a valuable antidote to the corrupt influence of town which he take with satisfaction and a sense of its utility to konstantin levin the country be good first because it afford a field for labor of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt to sergey ivanovitch the country be particularly good because there it be possible and fitting to do nothing moreover sergey ivanovitch ’s attitude to the peasant rather pique konstantin sergey ivanovitch use to say that he know and like the peasantry and he often talk to the peasant which he know how to do without affectation or condescension and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusion in favor of the peasantry and in confirmation of his know they konstantin levin do not like such an attitude to the peasant to konstantin the peasant be simply the chief partner in their common labor and in spite of all the respect and the love almost like that of kinship he have for the peasant — suck in probably as he say himself with the milk of his peasant nurse — still as a fellowworker with he while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor gentleness and justice of these man he be very often when their common labor call for other quality exasperate with the peasant for his carelessness lack of method drunkenness and lying if he have be ask whether he like or do not like the peasant konstantin levin would have be absolutely at a loss what to reply he like and do not like the peasant just as he like and do not like man in general of course be a goodhearted man he like man rather than he dislike they and so too with the peasant but like or dislike  the people  as something apart he could not not only because he live with  the people  and all his interest be bind up with theirs but also because he regard himself as a part of  the people  do not see any special quality or failing distinguish himself and  the people  and could not contrast himself with they moreover although he have live so long in the close relation with the peasant as farmer and arbitrator and what be more as adviser the peasant trust he and for thirty mile round they would come to ask his advice he have no definite view of  the people  and would have be as much at a loss to answer the question whether he know  the people  as the question whether he like they for he to say he know the peasantry would have be the same as to say he know man he be continually watch and get to know people of all sort and among they peasant whom he regard as good and interesting people and he be continually observe new point in they alter his former view of they and form new one with sergey ivanovitch it be quite the contrary just as he like and praise a country life in comparison with the life he do not like so too he like the peasantry in contradistinction to the class of man he do not like and so too he know the peasantry as something distinct from and oppose to man generally in his methodical brain there be distinctly formulate certain aspect of peasant life deduce partly from that life itself but chiefly from contrast with other mode of life he never change his opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards they in the discussion that arise between the brother on their view of the peasantry sergey ivanovitch always get the well of his brother precisely because sergey ivanovitch have definite idea about the peasant — his character his quality and his taste konstantin levin have no definite and unalterable idea on the subject and so in their argument konstantin be readily convict of contradict himself in sergey ivanovitch ’s eye his young brother be a capital fellow with his heart in the right place as he express it in french but with a mind which though fairly quick be too much influence by the impression of the moment and consequently fill with contradiction with all the condescension of an eld brother he sometimes explain to he the true import of thing but he derive little satisfaction from argue with he because he get the well of he too easily konstantin levin regard his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture as generous in the high sense of the word and possessed of a special faculty for work for the public good but in the depth of his heart the old he become and the more intimately he know his brother the more and more frequently the thought strike he that this faculty of work for the public good of which he feel himself utterly devoid be possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something — not a lack of good honest noble desire and taste but a lack of vital force of what be call heart of that impulse which drive a man to choose someone out of the innumerable path of life and to care only for that one the well he know his brother the more he notice that sergey ivanovitch and many other people who work for the public welfare be not lead by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good but reason from intellectual consideration that it be a right thing to take interest in public affair and consequently take interest in they levin be confirm in this generalization by observe that his brother do not take question affect the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he do chess problem or the ingenious construction of a new machine besides this konstantin levin be not at his ease with his brother because in summer in the country levin be continually busy with work on the land and the long summer day be not long enough for he to get through all he have to do while sergey ivanovitch be take a holiday but though he be take a holiday now that be to say he be do no writing he be so used to intellectual activity that he like to put into concise and eloquent shape the idea that occur to he and like to have someone to listen to he his most usual and natural listener be his brother and so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relation konstantin feel an awkwardness in leave he alone sergey ivanovitch like to stretch himself on the grass in the sun and to lie so bask and chat lazily  you would not believe  he would say to his brother  what a pleasure this rural laziness be to i not an idea in one ’s brain as empty as a drum  but konstantin levin find it dull sit and listen to he especially when he know that while he be away they would be cart dung onto the field not plough ready for it and heap it all up anyhow and would not screw the share in the plough but would let they come off and then say that the new plough be a silly invention and there be nothing like the old andreevna plough and so on  come you ’ve do enough trudge about in the heat  sergey ivanovitch would say to he  no i must just run round to the countinghouse for a minute  levin would answer and he would run off to the field early in june it happen that agafea mihalovna the old nurse and housekeeper in carry to the cellar a jar of mushroom she have just pickle slip fall and sprain her wrist the district doctor a talkative young medical student who have just finish his study come to see she he examine the wrist say it be not break be delight at a chance of talk to the celebrated sergey ivanovitch koznishev and to show his advanced view of thing tell he all the scandal of the district complain of the poor state into which the district council have fall sergey ivanovitch listen attentively ask he question and rouse by a new listener he talk fluently utter a few keen and weighty observation respectfully appreciate by the young doctor and be soon in that eager frame of mind his brother know so well which always with he follow a brilliant and eager conversation after the departure of the doctor he want to go with a fishing rod to the river sergey ivanovitch be fond of angling and be it seem proud of be able to care for such a stupid occupation konstantin levin whose presence be need in the plough land and meadow have come to take his brother in the trap it be that time of the year the turningpoint of summer when the crop of the present year be a certainty when one begin to think of the sowing for next year and the mowing be at hand when the rye be all in ear though its ear be still light not yet full and it wave in graygreen billow in the wind when the green oats with tuft of yellow grass scatter here and there among it droop irregularly over the latesown field when the early buckwheat be already out and hide the ground when the fallow land tread hard as stone by the cattle be half plough over with path leave untouched by the plough when from the dry dungheap cart onto the field there come at sunset a smell of manure mix with meadowsweet and on the lowlying land the riverside meadow be a thick sea of grass wait for the mowing with blackened heap of the stalk of sorrel among it it be the time when there come a brief pause in the toil of the field before the beginning of the labor of harvest — every year recur every year strain every nerve of the peasant the crop be a splendid one and bright hot summer day have set in with short dewy night the brother have to drive through the wood to reach the meadow sergey ivanovitch be all the while admire the beauty of the wood which be a tangled mass of leave point out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flower dark on the shady side and brightly spotted with yellow stipule now the young shoot of this year ’s sapling brilliant with emerald konstantin levin do not like talk and hear about the beauty of nature word for he take away the beauty of what he see he assent to what his brother say but he could not help begin to think of other thing when they come out of the wood all his attention be engross by the view of the fallow land on the upland in part yellow with grass in part trample and checker with furrow in part dot with ridge of dung and in part even plough a string of cart be move across it levin count the cart and be pleased that all that be want have be bring and at the sight of the meadow his thought pass to the mowing he always feel something special move he to the quick at the haymaking on reach the meadow levin stop the horse the morning dew be still lie on the thick undergrowth of the grass and that he might not get his foot wet sergey ivanovitch ask his brother to drive he in the trap up to the willow tree from which the carp be catch sorry as konstantin levin be to crush down his mowing grass he drive he into the meadow the high grass softly turn about the wheel and the horse ’s leg leave its seed cling to the wet axle and spoke of the wheel his brother seat himself under a bush arrange his tackle while levin lead the horse away fasten he up and walk into the vast graygreen sea of grass unstirred by the wind the silky grass with its ripe seed come almost to his waist in the damp spot cross the meadow konstantin levin come out onto the road and meet an old man with a swollen eye carry a skep on his shoulder  what take a stray swarm fomitch  he ask  no indeed konstantin dmitrich all we can do to keep our own this be the second swarm that have fly away luckily the lad catch they they be plough your field they unyoke the horse and gallop after they   well what do you say fomitch — start mow or wait a bit   eh well our way ’ to wait till st peter ’s day but you always mow soon well to be sure please god the hay ’ good there ’ll be plenty for the beast   what do you think about the weather   that ’ in god ’s hand maybe it will be fine  levin go up to his brother sergey ivanovitch have catch nothing but he be not bored and seem in the most cheerful frame of mind levin see that stimulate by his conversation with the doctor he want to talk levin on the other hand would have like to get home as soon as possible to give order about get together the mower for next day and to set at rest his doubt about the mowing which greatly absorb he  well let ’s be go  he say  why be in such a hurry let ’s stay a little but how wet you be even though one catch nothing it ’ nice that ’ the good thing about every part of sport that one have to do with nature how exquisite this steely water be  say sergey ivanovitch  these riverside bank always remind i of the riddle — do you know it  the grass say to the water we quiver and we quiver    i do not know the riddle  answer levin wearily  do you know i ’ve be think about you  say sergey ivanovitch  it ’ beyond everything what ’ be do in the district accord to what this doctor tell i he ’ a very intelligent fellow and as i ’ve tell you before i tell you again it ’ not right for you not to go to the meeting and altogether to keep out of the district business if decent people will not go into it of course it ’ bind to go all wrong we pay the money and it all go in salary and there be no school nor district nurse nor midwife nor drugstore — nothing   well i do try you know  levin say slowly and unwillingly  i can not and so there ’ no help for it   but why can not you i must own i can not make it out indifference incapacity — i will not admit surely it ’ not simply laziness   none of those thing i ’ve try and i see i can do nothing  say levin he have hardly grasp what his brother be say look towards the plough land across the river he make out something black but he could not distinguish whether it be a horse or the bailiff on horseback  why be it you can do nothing you make an attempt and do not succeed as you think and you give in how can you have so little selfrespect   selfrespect  say levin stung to the quick by his brother ’s word  i do not understand if they ’d tell i at college that other people understand the integral calculus and i do not then pride would have come in but in this case one want first to be convince that one have certain qualification for this sort of business and especially that all this business be of great importance   what do you mean to say it ’ not of importance  say sergey ivanovitch sting to the quick too at his brother ’s consider anything of no importance that interest he and still more at his obviously pay little attention to what he be say  i do not think it important it do not take hold of i i can not help it  answer levin make out that what he see be the bailiff and that the bailiff seem to be let the peasant go off the plough land they be turn the plough over  can they have finish plough  he wonder  come really though  say the eld brother with a frown on his handsome clever face  there ’ a limit to everything it ’ very well to be original and genuine and to dislike everything conventional — i know all about that but really what you ’re say either have no meaning or it have a very wrong meaning how can you think it a matter of no importance whether the peasant whom you love as you assert   i never do assert it  think konstantin levin  die without help the ignorant peasantwoman starve the child and the people stagnate in darkness and be helpless in the hand of every village clerk while you have at your disposal a means of help they and do not help they because to your mind it ’ of no importance  and sergey ivanovitch put before he the alternative either you be so undeveloped that you can not see all that you can do or you will not sacrifice your ease your vanity or whatever it be to do it konstantin levin feel that there be no course open to he but to submit or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good and this mortify he and hurt his feeling  it ’ both  he say resolutely  i do not see that it be possible   what be it impossible if the money be properly lay out to provide medical aid   impossible as it seem to i for the three thousand square mile of our district what with our thaw and the storm and the work in the field i do not see how it be possible to provide medical aid all over and besides i do not believe in medicine   oh well that ’ unfair   i can quote to you thousand of instance but the school anyway   why have school   what do you mean can there be two opinion of the advantage of education if it ’ a good thing for you it ’ a good thing for everyone  konstantin levin feel himself morally pin against a wall and so he get hot and unconsciously blurt out the chief cause of his indifference to public business  perhaps it you all be very good but why should i worry myself about establish dispensary which i shall never make use of and school to which i shall never send my child to which even the peasant do not want to send their child and to which i ’ve no very firm faith that they ought to send they  say he sergey ivanovitch be for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject but he promptly make a new plan of attack he be silent for a little draw out a hook throw it in again and turn to his brother smile  come now in the first place the dispensary be need we ourselves send for the district doctor for agafea mihalovna   oh well but i fancy her wrist will never be straight again   that remain to be prove next the peasant who can read and write be as a workman of more use and value to you   no you can ask anyone you like  konstantin levin answer with decision  the man that can read and write be much inferior as a workman and mend the highroad be an impossibility and as soon as they put up bridge they ’re steal   still that ’ not the point  say sergey ivanovitch frown he dislike contradiction and still more argument that be continually skip from one thing to another introduce new and disconnected point so that there be no knowing to which to reply  do you admit that education be a benefit for the people   yes i admit it  say levin without think and he be conscious immediately that he have say what he do not think he feel that if he admit that it would be prove that he have be talk meaningless rubbish how it would be prove he could not tell but he know that this would inevitably be logically prove to he and he await the proof the argument turn out to be far simple than he have expect  if you admit that it be a benefit  say sergey ivanovitch  then as an honest man you can not help care about it and sympathize with the movement and so wish to work for it   but i still do not admit this movement to be just  say konstantin levin redden a little  what but you say just now   that ’ to say i do not admit it ’ be either good or possible   that you can not tell without make the trial   well suppose that ’ so  say levin though he do not suppose so at all  suppose that be so still i do not see all the same what i ’m to worry myself about it for   how so   no since we be talk explain it to i from the philosophical point of view  say levin  i can not see where philosophy come in  say sergey ivanovitch in a tone levin fancy as though he do not admit his brother ’s right to talk about philosophy and that irritate levin  i ’ll tell you then  he say with heat  i imagine the mainspring of all our action be after all selfinterest now in the local institution i as a nobleman see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity and the road be not well and could not be well my horse carry i well enough over bad one doctor and dispensary be no use to i an arbitrator of dispute be no use to i i never appeal to he and never shall appeal to he the school be no good to i but positively harmful as i tell you for i the district institution simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acre to drive into the town sleep with bug and listen to all sort of idiocy and loathsomeness and selfinterest offer i no inducement   excuse i  sergey ivanovitch interpose with a smile  selfinterest do not induce we to work for the emancipation of the serf but we do work for it   no  konstantin levin break in with still great heat  the emancipation of the serf be a different matter there selfinterest do come in one long to throw off that yoke that crush we all decent people among we but to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustman be need and how chimney shall be construct in the town in which i do not live — to serve on a jury and try a peasant who ’ steal a flitch of bacon and listen for six hour at a stretch to all sort of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution and the president crossexamine my old halfwitted alioshka  do you admit prisoner in the dock the fact of the removal of the bacon   eh   konstantin levin have warm to his subject and begin mimic the president and the halfwitted alioshka it seem to he that it be all to the point but sergey ivanovitch shrug his shoulder  well what do you mean to say then   i simply mean to say that those right that touch i   my interest i shall always defend to the good of my ability that when they make raid on we student and the police read our letter i be ready to defend those right to the utmost to defend my right to education and freedom i can understand compulsory military service which affect my child my brother and myself i be ready to deliberate on what concern i but deliberate on how to spend forty thousand rouble of district council money or judge the halfwitted alioshka — i do not understand and i can not do it  konstantin levin speak as though the floodgate of his speech have burst open sergey ivanovitch smile  but tomorrow it ’ll be your turn to be try would it have suit your taste well to be try in the old criminal tribunal   i ’m not go to be try i shall not murder anybody and i ’ve no need of it well i tell you what  he go on fly off again to a subject quite beside the point  our district selfgovernment and all the rest of it — it ’ just like the birch branch we stick in the ground on trinity day for instance to look like a copse which have grow up of itself in europe and i can not gush over these birch branch and believe in they  sergey ivanovitch merely shrug his shoulder as though to express his wonder how the birch branch have come into their argument at that point though he do really understand at once what his brother mean  excuse i but you know one really can not argue in that way  he observe but konstantin levin want to justify himself for the failing of which he be conscious of lack of zeal for the public welfare and he go on  i imagine  he say  that no sort of activity be likely to be lasting if it be not found on selfinterest that ’ a universal principle a philosophical principle  he say repeat the word  philosophical  with determination as though wish to show that he have as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy sergey ivanovitch smile  he too have a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendency  he think  come you ’d well let philosophy alone  he say  the chief problem of the philosophy of all age consist just in find the indispensable connection which exist between individual and social interest but that ’ not to the point what be to the point be a correction i must make in your comparison the birch be not simply stick in but some be sow and some be plant and one must deal carefully with they it ’ only those people that have an intuitive sense of what ’ of importance and significance in their institution and know how to value they that have a future before they — it ’ only those people that one can truly call historical  and sergey ivanovitch carry the subject into the region of philosophical history where konstantin levin could not follow he and show he all the incorrectness of his view  as for your dislike of it excuse my say so that ’ simply our russian sloth and old serfowner ’s way and i ’m convinced that in you it ’ a temporary error and will pass  konstantin be silent he feel himself vanquish on all side but he feel at the same time that what he want to say be unintelligible to his brother only he could not make up his mind whether it be unintelligible because he be not capable of express his meaning clearly or because his brother would not or could not understand he but he do not pursue the speculation and without reply he fall to muse on a quite different and personal matter sergey ivanovitch wind up the last line untie the horse and they drive off the personal matter that absorb levin during his conversation with his brother be this once in a previous year he have go to look at the mowing and be make very angry by the bailiff he have recourse to his favorite mean for regain his temper — he take a scythe from a peasant and begin mow he like the work so much that he have several time try his hand at mowing since he have cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house and this year ever since the early spring he have cherish a plan for mow for whole day together with the peasant ever since his brother ’s arrival he have be in doubt whether to mow or not he be loath to leave his brother alone all day long and he be afraid his brother would laugh at he about it but as he drive into the meadow and recall the sensation of mowing he come near decide that he would go mowing after the irritating discussion with his brother he ponder over this intention again  i must have physical exercise or my temper’ll certainly be ruin  he think and he determine he would go mowing however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasant towards evening konstantin levin go to his counting house give direction as to the work to be do and send about the village to summon the mower for the morrow to cut the hay in kalinov meadow the large and good of his grass land  and send my scythe please to tit for he to set it and bring it round tomorrow i shall maybe do some mowing myself too  he say try not to be embarrassed the bailiff smile and say  yes sir  at tea the same evening levin say to his brother  i fancy the fine weather will last tomorrow i shall start mow   i ’m so fond of that form of field labor  say sergey ivanovitch  i ’m awfully fond of it i sometimes mow myself with the peasant and tomorrow i want to try mow the whole day  sergey ivanovitch lift his head and look with interest at his brother  how do you mean just like one of the peasant all day long   yes it ’ very pleasant  say levin  it ’ splendid as exercise only you ’ll hardly be able to stand it  say sergey ivanovitch without a shade of irony  i ’ve try it it ’ hard work at first but you get into it i dare say i shall manage to keep it up   really what an idea but tell i how do the peasant look at it i suppose they laugh in their sleeve at their master ’s be such a queer fish   no i do not think so but it ’ so delightful and at the same time such hard work that one have no time to think about it   but how will you do about dine with they to send you a bottle of lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward   no i ’ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest  next morning konstantin levin get up early than usual but he be detain give direction on the farm and when he reach the mow grass the mower be already at their second row from the upland he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below with its grayish ridge of cut grass and the black heap of coat take off by the mower at the place from which they have start cut gradually as he ride towards the meadow the peasant come into sight some in coat some in their shirt mow one behind another in a long stre swinge their scythe differently he count fortytwo of they they be mow slowly over the uneven lowlying part of the meadow where there have be an old dam levin recognize some of his own man here be old yermil in a very long white smock bend forward to swing a scythe there be a young fellow vaska who have be a coachman of levin ’s take every row with a wide sweep here too be tit levin ’s preceptor in the art of mow a thin little peasant he be in front of all and cut his wide row without bend as though play with the scythe levin get off his mare and fasten she up by the roadside go to meet tit who take a second scythe out of a bush and give it to he  it ’ ready sir it ’ like a razor cut of itself  say tit take off his cap with a smile and give he the scythe levin take the scythe and begin try it as they finish their row the mower hot and goodhumored come out into the road one after another and laugh a little greet the master you all stare at he but no one make any remark till a tall old man with a wrinkled beardless face wear a short sheepskin jacket come out into the road and accost he  look’ee now master once take hold of the rope there ’ no let it go  he say and levin hear smother laughter among the mower  i ’ll try not to let it go  he say take his stand behind tit and wait for the time to begin  mind’ee  repeat the old man tit make room and levin start behind he the grass be short close to the road and levin who have not do any mowing for a long while and be disconcert by the eye fasten upon he cut badly for the first moment though he swing his scythe vigorously behind he he hear voice  it ’ not set right handle ’ too high see how he have to stoop to it  say one  press more on the heel  say another  never mind he ’ll get on all right  the old man resume  he ’ make a start you swing it too wide you ’ll tire yourself out the master sure do his good for himself but see the grass miss out for such work we fellow would catch it  the grass become soft and levin listen without answer follow tit try to do the good he could they move a hundred pace tit keep move on without stop not show the slight weariness but levin be already begin to be afraid he would not be able to keep it up he be so tired he feel as he swing his scythe that he be at the very end of his strength and be make up his mind to ask tit to stop but at that very moment tit stop of his own accord and stoop down pick up some grass rub his scythe and begin whet it levin straighten himself and draw a deep breath look round behind he come a peasant and he too be evidently tired for he stop at once without wait to mow up to levin and begin whet his scythe tit sharpen his scythe and levin ’s and they go on the next time it be just the same tit move on with sweep after sweep of his scythe not stop nor show sign of weariness levin follow he try not to get leave behind and he find it hard and hard the moment come when he feel he have no strength leave but at that very moment tit stop and whet the scythe so they mow the first row and this long row seem particularly hard work to levin but when the end be reach and tit shoulder his scythe begin with deliberate stride return on the track leave by his heel in the cut grass and levin walk back in the same way over the space he have cut in spite of the sweat that run in stream over his face and fall in drop down his nose and drench his back as though he have be soak in water he feel very happy what delight he particularly be that now he know he would be able to hold out his pleasure be only disturb by his row not be well cut  i will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body  he think compare tit ’s row which look as if it have be cut with a line with his own unevenly and irregularly lie grass the first row as levin notice tit have mow specially quickly probably wish to put his master to the test and the row happen to be a long one the next row be easy but still levin have to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasant he think of nothing wish for nothing but not to be leave behind the peasant and to do his work as well as possible he hear nothing but the swish of scythe and see before he tit ’s upright figure mow away the crescentshaped curve of the cut grass the grass and flower head slowly and rhythmically fall before the blade of his scythe and ahead of he the end of the row where would come the rest suddenly in the midst of his toil without understand what it be or whence it come he feel a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot moist shoulder he glance at the sky in the interval for whet the scythe a heavy lower storm cloud have blow up and big raindrop be fall some of the peasant go to their coat and put they on other — just like levin himself — merely shrug their shoulder enjoy the pleasant coolness of it another row and yet another row follow — long row and short row with good grass and with poor grass levin lose all sense of time and could not have tell whether it be late or early now a change begin to come over his work which give he immense satisfaction in the midst of his toil there be moment during which he forget what he be do and it come all easy to he and at those same moment his row be almost as smooth and well cut as tit ’s but so soon as he recollect what he be do and begin try to do well he be at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task and the row be badly mow on finish yet another row he would have go back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next but tit stop and go up to the old man say something in a low voice to he they both look at the sun  what be they talk about and why do not he go back  think levin not guess that the peasant have be mow no less than four hour without stop and it be time for their lunch  lunch sir  say the old man  be it really time that ’ right lunch then  levin give his scythe to tit and together with the peasant who be cross the long stretch of mown grass slightly sprinkle with rain to get their bread from the heap of coat he go towards his house only then he suddenly awake to the fact that he have be wrong about the weather and the rain be drench his hay  the hay will be spoil  he say  not a bit of it sir mow in the rain and you ’ll rake in fine weather  say the old man levin untie his horse and ride home to his coffee sergey ivanovitch be only just get up when he have drink his coffee levin ride back again to the mowing before sergey ivanovitch have have time to dress and come down to the diningroom after lunch levin be not in the same place in the string of mower as before but stand between the old man who have accost he jocosely and now invite he to be his neighbor and a young peasant who have only be marry in the autumn and who be mow this summer for the first time the old man hold himself erect move in front with his foot turn out take long regular stride and with a precise and regular action which seem to cost he no more effort than swinge one ’s arm in walk as though it be in play he lay down the high even row of grass it be as though it be not he but the sharp scythe of itself swish through the juicy grass behind levin come the lad mishka his pretty boyish face with a twist of fresh grass bind round his hair be all work with effort but whenever anyone look at he he smile he would clearly have die soon than own it be hard work for he levin keep between they in the very heat of the day the mowing do not seem such hard work to he the perspiration with which he be drench cool he while the sun that burn his back his head and his arm bare to the elbow give a vigor and dogged energy to his labor and more and more often now come those moment of unconsciousness when it be possible not to think what one be do the scythe cut of itself these be happy moment still more delightful be the moment when they reach the stream where the row end and the old man rub his scythe with the wet thick grass rinse its blade in the fresh water of the stream ladle out a little in a tin dipper and offer levin a drink  what do you say to my homebrew eh good eh  say he wink and truly levin have never drink any liquor so good as this warm water with green bit float in it and a taste of rust from the tin dipper and immediately after this come the delicious slow saunter with his hand on the scythe during which he could wipe away the stream sweat take deep breath of air and look about at the long string of mower and at what be happen around in the forest and the country the long levin mow the oftener he feel the moment of unconsciousness in which it seem not his hand that swing the scythe but the scythe mowing of itself a body full of life and consciousness of its own and as though by magic without think of it the work turn out regular and wellfinished of itself these be the most blissful moment it be only hard work when he have to break off the motion which have become unconscious and to think when he have to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel the old man do this easily when a hillock come he change his action and at one time with the heel and at another with the tip of his scythe clip the hillock round both side with short stroke and while he do this he keep look about and watch what come into his view at one moment he pick a wild berry and eat it or offer it to levin then he fling away a twig with the blade of the scythe then he look at a quail ’s nest from which the bird fly just under the scythe or catch a snake that cross his path and lift it on the scythe as though on a fork show it to levin and throw it away for both levin and the young peasant behind he such change of position be difficult both of they repeat over and over again the same strained movement be in a perfect frenzy of toil and be incapable of shift their position and at the same time watch what be before they levin do not notice how time be pass if he have be ask how long he have be work he would have say half an hour — and it be get on for dinner time as they be walk back over the cut grass the old man call levin ’s attention to the little girl and boy who be come from different direction hardly visible through the long grass and along the road towards the mower carry sack of bread drag at their little hand and pitcher of the sour ryebeer with cloth wrap round they  look’ee the little emmet crawl  he say point to they and he shade his eye with his hand to look at the sun they mow two more row the old man stop  come master dinner time  he say briskly and on reach the stream the mower move off across the line of cut grass towards their pile of coat where the child who have bring their dinner be sit wait for they the peasant gather into group — those far away under a cart those near under a willow bush levin sit down by they he feel disinclined to go you all constraint with the master have disappear long ago the peasant get ready for dinner some wash the young lad bathe in the stream other make a place comfortable for a rest untie their sack of bread and uncover the pitcher of ryebeer the old man crumble up some bread in a cup stir it with the handle of a spoon pour water on it from the dipper break up some more bread and have season it with salt he turn to the east to say his prayer  come master taste my sop  say he kneel down before the cup the sop be so good that levin give up the idea of go home he dine with the old man and talk to he about his family affair take the keen interest in they and tell he about his own affair and all the circumstance that could be of interest to the old man he feel much near to he than to his brother and could not help smile at the affection he feel for this man when the old man get up again say his prayer and lie down under a bush put some grass under his head for a pillow levin do the same and in spite of the cling fly that be so persistent in the sunshine and the midge that tickle his hot face and body he fall asleep at once and only wake when the sun have pass to the other side of the bush and reach he the old man have be awake a long while and be sit up whet the scythe of the young lad levin look about he and hardly recognize the place everything be so changed the immense stretch of meadow have be mow and be sparkle with a peculiar fresh brilliance with its line of already sweetsmelle grass in the slant ray of the evening sun and the bush about the river have be cut down and the river itself not visible before now gleam like steel in its bend and the move ascend peasant and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow and the hawk hover over the stripped meadow — all be perfectly new raise himself levin begin consider how much have be cut and how much more could still be do that day the work do be exceptionally much for fortytwo man they have cut the whole of the big meadow which have in the year of serf labor take thirty scythe two day to mow only the corner remain to do where the row be short but levin feel a longing to get as much mowing do that day as possible and be vex with the sun sink so quickly in the sky he feel no weariness all he want be to get his work do more and more quickly and as much do as possible  could you cut mashkin upland too — what do you think  he say to the old man  as god will the sun ’ not high a little vodka for the lad  at the afternoon rest when they be sit down again and those who smoke have light their pipe the old man tell the man that  mashkin upland ’ to be cut — there’ll be some vodka   why not cut it come on tit we ’ll look sharp we can eat at night come on  cry voice and eat up their bread the mower go back to work  come lad keep it up  say tit and run on ahead almost at a trot  get along get along  say the old man hurry after he and easily overtake he  i ’ll mow you down look out  and young and old mow away as though they be race with one another but however fast they work they do not spoil the grass and the row be lay just as neatly and exactly the little piece leave uncut in the corner be mow in five minute the last of the mower be just end their row while the foremost snatch up their coat onto their shoulder and cross the road towards mashkin upland the sun be already sink into the tree when they go with their jingle dipper into the wooded ravine of mashkin upland the grass be up to their waist in the middle of the hollow soft tender and feathery spot here and there among the tree with wild heart’sease after a brief consultation — whether to take the row lengthwise or diagonally — prohor yermilin also a renowned mower a huge blackhaired peasant go on

cut with a juicy sound and be at once lay in high fragrant row the mower from all side bring close together in the short row keep urge one another on to the sound of jingle dipper and clang scythe and the his of the whetstone sharpen they and goodhumored shout levin still keep between the young peasant and the old man the old man who have put on his short sheepskin jacket be just as goodhumored jocose and free in his movement among the tree they be continually cut with their scythe the socalle  birch mushroom  swollen fat in the succulent grass but the old man bend down every time he come across a mushroom pick it up and put it in his bosom  another present for my old woman  he say as he do so easy as it be to mow the wet soft grass it be hard work go up and down the steep side of the ravine but this do not trouble the old man swinge his scythe just as ever and move his foot in their big plaited shoe with firm little step he climb slowly up the steep place and though his breech hang out below his smock and his whole frame tremble with effort he do not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way and keep make joke with the peasant and levin levin walk after he and often think he must fall as he climb with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have be hard work to clamber without anything but he climb up and do what he have to do he feel as though some external force be move he mashkin upland be mow the last row finish the peasant have put on their coat and be gaily trudge home levin get on his horse and part regretfully from the peasant ride

over the house and give instruction about everything that he consider necessary what he consider necessary be to cover all the furniture with cretonne to put up curtain to weed the garden to make a little bridge on the pond and to plant flower but he forget many other essential matter the want of which greatly distress darya alexandrovna later on in spite of stepan arkadyevitch ’s effort to be an attentive father and husband he never could keep in his mind that he have a wife and child he have bachelor taste and it be in accordance with they that he shape his life on his return to moscow he inform his wife with pride that everything be ready that the house would be a little paradise and that he advise she most certainly to go his wife ’s stay away in the country be very agreeable to

from all the unpleasantness of the town that life there though not luxurious — dolly could easily make up her mind to that — be cheap and comfortable that there be plenty of everything everything be cheap everything could be get and child be happy but now come to the country as the head of a family she perceive that it be all utterly unlike what she have fancy the day after their arrival there be

the cattle stray into the garden through a gap in the hedge and there be one terrible bull who bellow and therefore might be expect to gore somebody there be no proper cupboard for their clothe what cupboard there be either would not close at all or burst open whenever anyone pass by they there be no pot and pan there be no copper in the washhouse nor even an ironingboard in the maid  room find instead of peace and rest all these from her point of view fearful calamity darya alexandrovna be at first in despair she exert herself to the utmost feel the hopelessness of the position and be every instant suppress the tear that start into her eye the bailiff a retired quartermaster whom stepan arkadyevitch have take a fancy to and have appoint bailiff on account of his handsome and respectful appearance as a hallporter show no sympathy for darya alexandrovna ’s woe he say respectfully  nothing can be do the peasant be such a wretched lot  and do nothing to help she the position seem hopeless but in the oblonskys  household as in all family indeed there be one inconspicuous but most valuable and useful person marya philimonovna she soothe her mistress assure she that everything would come round it be her expression and matvey have borrow it from she and without fuss or hurry proceed to set to work herself she have immediately make friend with the bailiff ’s wife and on the very first day she drink tea with she and the bailiff under the acacia and review all the circumstance of the position very soon marya philimonovna have establish her club so to say under the acacia and there it be in this club consist of the bailiff ’s wife the village elder and the countinghouse clerk that the difficulty of existence be gradually smooth away and in a week ’s time everything

mangle hook be put in the cupboard and they cease to burst open spontaneously and an ironingboard cover with army cloth be place across from the arm of a chair to the chest of drawer and there be a smell of flatiron in the maid  room  just see now and you be quite in despair  say marya philimonovna point to the ironingboard they even rig up a bathingshed of straw hurdle lily begin to bathe and darya alexandrovna begin to realize if only in part her expectation if not of a peaceful at least of a comfortable life in the country peaceful with six child darya alexandrovna could not be one would fall ill another might easily become so a third would be without something necessary a fourth would show symptom of a bad disposition and so on rare indeed be the brief period of peace but these care and anxiety be for darya alexandrovna the sole happiness possible have it not be for they she would have be leave alone to brood over her husband who do not love she and besides hard though it be for the mother to bear the dread of illness the illness themselves and the grief of see sign of evil propensity in her child — the child themselves be even now repay she in small joy for her suffering those joy be so small that they pass unnoticed like gold in sand and at bad moment she could see nothing but the pain nothing but sand but there be good moment too when she see nothing but the joy nothing but gold now in the solitude of the country she begin to be more and more frequently aware of those joy often look at they she would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she be mistake that she as a mother be partial to her child all the same she could not help say to herself that she have charm child all six of they in different way but a set of child such as be not often to be meet with and she be happy in they and proud of they towards the end of may when everything have be more or less satisfactorily arrange she receive her husband ’s answer to her complaint of the disorganized state of thing in the country he write beg she forgiveness for not have think of everything before and promise to come down at the first chance this chance do not present itself and till the beginning of june darya alexandrovna stay alone in the country on the sunday in st peter ’s week darya alexandrovna drive to mass for all her child to take the sacrament darya alexandrovna in her intimate philosophical talk with her sister her mother and her friend very often astonish they by the freedom of her view in regard to religion she have a strange religion of transmigration of soul all her own in which she have firm faith trouble herself little about the dogma of the church but in her family she be strict in carry out all that be require by the church — and not merely in order to set an example but with all her heart in it the fact that the child have not be at the sacrament for nearly a year worry she extremely and with the full approval and sympathy of marya philimonovna she decide that this should take place now in the summer for several day before darya alexandrovna be busily deliberate on how to dress all the child frock be make or alter and wash seam and flounce be let out button be sew on and ribbon get ready one dress tanya ’s which the english governess have undertake cost darya alexandrovna much loss of temper the english governess in alter it have make

happy thought of put in gusset and add a little shouldercape the dress be set right but there be nearly a quarrel with the english governess on the morning however all be happily arrange and towards ten o’clock — the time at which they have ask the priest to wait for they for the mass — the child in their new dress with beam face stand on the step before the carriage wait for their mother to the carriage instead of the restive raven they have harness thank to the representation of marya philimonovna the bailiff ’s horse brownie and darya alexandrovna delay by anxiety over her own attire come out and get in dress in a white muslin gown darya alexandrovna have do her hair and dress with care and excitement in the old day she have dress for her own sake to look pretty and be admire later on as she get old dress become more and more distasteful to she she see that she be lose her good look but now she begin to feel pleasure and interest in dress again now she do not dress for her own sake not for the sake of her own beauty but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creature she might not spoil the general effect and look at herself for the last time in the lookingglass she be satisfied with herself she look nice not nice as she would have wish to look nice in old day at a ball but nice for the object which she now have in view in the church there be no one but the peasant the servant and their womenfolk but darya alexandrovna see or fancy she see the sensation produce by her child and she the child be not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dress but they be charming in the way they behave aliosha it be true do not stand quite correctly he keep turn round try to look at his little jacket from behind but all the same he be wonderfully sweet tanya behave like a grownup person and look after the little one and the small lily be bewitch in her naïve astonishment at everything and it be difficult not to smile when after take the sacrament she say in english  please some more  on the way home the child feel that something solemn have happen and be very sedate everything go happily at home too but at lunch grisha begin whistle and what be bad be disobedient to the english governess and be forbid to have any tart darya alexandrovna would not have let thing go so far on such a day have she be present but she have to support the english

that he be not cry for the tart — he do not care — but at be unjustly treat this be really too tragic and darya alexandrovna make up her mind to persuade the english governess to forgive grisha and she go to speak to she but on the way as she pass the drawingroom she behold a scene fill her heart with such pleasure that the tear come into her eye and she forgive the delinquent herself the culprit be sit at the window in the corner of the drawingroom beside he be stand tanya with a plate on the pretext of want to give some dinner to her doll she have ask the governess ’s permission to

a girl who see you man from afar who take everything on trust — a girl may have and often have such a feeling that she can not tell what to say   yes if the heart do not speak   no the heart do speak but just consider you man have view about a girl you come to the house you make friend you criticize you wait to see if you have find what you love and then when you be sure you love she you make an offer   well that ’ not quite it   anyway you make an offer when your love be ripe or when the balance have completely turn between the two you be choose from but a girl be not ask she be expect to make her choice and yet she can not choose she can only answer  yes  or  no    yes to choose between i and vronsky  think levin and the dead thing that have come to life within he die again and only weigh on his heart and set it ache  darya alexandrovna  he say  that ’ how one choose a new dress or some purchase or other not love the choice have be make and so much the well and there can be no repeat it   ah pride pride  say darya alexandrovna as though despise he for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only woman know  at the time when you make kitty an offer she be just in a position in which she could not answer she be in doubt doubt between you and vronsky he she be see every day and you she have not see for a long while suppose she have be old   i for instance in her place could have feel no doubt i always dislike he and so it have turn out  levin recall kitty ’s answer she have say  no that can not be   darya alexandrovna  he say dryly  i

could not remember the french for spade the mother prompt she and then tell she in french where to look for the spade and this make a disagreeable impression on levin everything in darya alexandrovna ’s house and child strike he now as by no means so charming as a little while before  and what do she talk french with the child for  he think  how unnatural and false it be and the child feel it so learn french and unlearn sincerity  he think to himself unaware that darya alexandrovna have think all that over twenty time already and yet even at the cost of some loss of sincerity believe it necessary to teach her child french in that way  but why be you go do stay a little  levin stay to tea but his goodhumor have vanish and he feel ill at ease after tea he go out into the hall to order his horse to be put in and when he come back he find darya alexandrovna greatly disturbed with a troubled face and tear in her eye while levin have be outside an incident have occur which have utterly

sight tanya be pull grisha ’s hair while he with a face hideous with rage be beat she with his fist wherever he could get at she something snap in darya alexandrovna ’s heart when she see this it be as if darkness have swoop down upon her life she feel that these child of hers that she be so proud of be not merely most ordinary but positively bad illbred child with coarse brutal propensity — wicked child she could not talk or think of anything else and she could not speak to levin of her misery levin see she be unhappy and try to comfort she say that it show nothing bad that all child fight but even as he say it he be think in his heart  no i will not be artificial and talk french with my child but my child will not be like that all one have to do be not spoil child not to distort their nature and they ’ll be delightful no my child will not be like that  he say goodbye and drive away and she do not try to keep he in the middle of july the elder of the village on levin ’s sister ’s estate about fifteen mile from pokrovskoe come to levin to report on how thing be go there and on the hay the chief source of income on his sister ’s estate be from the riverside meadow in former year the hay have be buy by the peasant for twenty rouble the three acre when levin take over the management of the estate he think on examine the grassland that they be worth more and he fix the price at twentyfive rouble the three acre the peasant would not give that price and as levin suspect keep off other purchaser then levin have drive over himself and arrange to have the grass cut partly by hire labor partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop his own peasant put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement but it be carry out and the first year the meadow have yield a profit almost double the previous year — which be the third year — the peasant have maintain the same opposition to the arrangement and the hay have be cut on the same system this year the peasant be do all the mowing for a third of the hay crop and the village elder have come now to announce that the hay have be cut and that fear rain they have invite the countinghouse clerk over have divide the crop in his presence and have rake together eleven stack as the owner ’s share from the vague answer to his question how much hay have be cut on the principal meadow from the hurry of the village elder who have make the division not ask leave from the whole tone of the peasant levin perceive that there be something wrong in the division of the hay and make up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter arrive for dinner at the village and leave his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his the husband of his brother ’s wetnurse levin go to see the old man in his beehouse want to find out from he the truth about the hay parmenitch a talkative comely old man give levin a very warm welcome show he all he be do tell he everything about his bee and the swarm of that year but give vague and unwilling answer to levin ’s inquiry about the mowing this confirm levin still more in his suspicion he go to the hay field and examine the stack the haystack could not possibly contain fifty wagonload each and to convict the peasant levin order the wagon that have carry the hay to be bring up directly to lift one stack and carry it into the barn there turn out to be only thirtytwo load in the stack in spite of the village elder ’s assertion about the compressibility of hay and its have settle down in the stack and his swearing that everything have be do in the fear of god levin stick to his point that the hay have be divide without his order and that therefore he would not accept that hay as fifty load to a stack after a prolonged dispute the matter be decide by the peasant take these eleven stack reckon they as fifty load each the argument and the division of the haycock last the whole afternoon when the last of the hay have be divide levin intrust the superintendence of the rest to the countinghouse clerk sit down on a haycock mark off by a stake of willow and look admiringly at the meadow swarm with peasant in front of he in the bend

levin look more attentively at ivan parmenov and his wife they be load a haycock onto the cart not far from he ivan parmenov be stand on the cart take lay in place and stamp down the huge bundle of hay which his pretty young wife deftly hand up to he at first in armful and then on the pitchfork the young wife work easily merrily and dexterously the closepacked hay do not once break away off her fork first she gather it together stick the fork into it then with a rapid supple movement lean the whole weight of her body on it and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she draw herself up and arch her full bosom under the white smock with a smart turn swing the fork in her arm and fling the bundle of hay high onto the cart ivan obviously do his good to save she every minute of unnecessary labor make haste open his arm to clutch the bundle and lie it in the cart as she rake together what be leave of the hay the young wife shake off the bit of hay that have fall on her neck and straighten the red kerchief that have drop forward over her white brow not brown like her face by the sun she creep under the cart to tie up the load ivan direct she how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece and at something she say he laugh aloud in the expression of both face be to be see vigorous young freshly awaken love the load be tie on ivan jump down and take the quiet sleek horse by the bridle the young wife fling the rake up on the load and with a bold step swinge her arm she go to join the woman who be form a ring for the haymaker  dance ivan drive off to the road and fall into line with the other load cart the peasant woman with their rake on their shoulder gay with bright flower and chatter with ring merry voice walk behind the hay cart one wild untrained female voice break into a song and sing it alone through a verse and then the same verse be take up and repeat by half a hundred strong healthy voice of all sort coarse and fine singe in unison the woman all singe begin to come close to levin and he feel as though a storm be swoop down upon he with a thunder of merriment the storm swoop down envelop he and the haycock on which he be lie and the other haycock and the wagonload and the whole meadow and distant field all seem to be shake and singe to the measure of this wild merry song with its shout and whistle and clapping levin feel envious of this health and mirthfulness he long to take part in the expression of this joy of life but he could do nothing and have to lie and look on and listen when the peasant with their singing have vanish out of sight and hear a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation his physical inactivity his alienation from this world come over levin some of the very peasant who have be most active in wrangle with he over the hay some whom he have treat with contumely and who have try to cheat he those very peasant have greet he goodhumoredly and evidently have not be incapable of have any feeling of rancor against he any regret any recollection even of have try to deceive he all that be drown in a sea of merry common labor god give the day god give the strength and the day and the strength be consecrate to labor and that labor be its own reward for whom the labor what would be its fruit these be idle consideration — beside the point often levin have admire this life often he have a sense of envy of the man who lead this life but today for the first time especially under the influence of what he have see in the attitude of ivan parmenov to his young wife the idea present itself definitely to his mind that it be in his power to exchange the dreary artificial idle and individualistic life he be lead for this laborious pure and socially delightful life the old man who have be sit beside he have long ago go home the people have all separate those who live near have go home while those who come from far be gather into a group for supper and to spend the night in the meadow levin unobserved by the peasant still lie on the haycock and still look on and listen and muse the peasant who remain for the night in the meadow scarcely sleep all the short summer night at first there be the sound of merry talk and laugh all together over the supper then singe again and laughter all the long day of toil have leave no trace in they but lightness of heart before the early dawn all be hush nothing be to be hear but the night sound of the frog that never cease in the marsh and the horse snort in the mist that rise over the meadow before the morning rouse himself levin get up from the haycock and look at the star he see that the night be over  well what be i go to do how be i to set about it  he say to himself try to express to himself all the thought and feeling he have pass through in that brief night all the thought and feeling he have pass through fall into three separate train of thought one be the renunciation of his old life of his utterly useless education this renunciation give he satisfaction and be easy and simple another series of thought and mental image relate to the life he long to live now the simplicity the purity the sanity of this life he feel clearly and he be convinced he would find in it the content the peace and the dignity of the lack of which he be so miserably conscious but a third series of idea turn upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new and there nothing take clear shape for he  have a wife have work and the necessity of work leave pokrovskoe buy land become a member of a peasant community marry a peasant girl how be i to set about it  he ask himself again and could not find an answer  i have not sleep all night though and i can not think it out clearly  he say to himself  i ’ll work it out later one thing ’ certain this night have decide my fate all my old dream of home life be absurd not the real thing  he tell himself  it ’ all ever so much simple and well   how beautiful  he think look at the strange as it be motherofpearl shell of white fleecy cloudlet rest right over his head in the middle of the sky  how exquisite it all be in this exquisite night and when be there time for that cloudshell to form just now i look at the sky and there be nothing in it — only two white streak yes and so imperceptibly too my view of life change  he go out of the meadow and walk along the highroad towards the village a slight wind arise and the sky look gray and sullen the gloomy moment have come that usually precede the dawn the full triumph of light over darkness shrink from the cold levin walk rapidly look at the ground  what ’ that someone come  he think catch the tinkle of bell and lift his head forty pace from he a carriage with four horse harness abreast be drive towards he along the grassy road on which he be walk the shafthorse be tilt against the shaft by the rut but the dexterous driver sit on the box hold the shaft over the rut so that the wheel run on the smooth part of the road this be all levin notice and without wonder who it could be he gaze absently at the coach in the coach be an old lady doze in one corner and at the window evidently only just awake sit a young girl hold in both hand the ribbon of a white cap with a face full of light and think full of a subtle complex inner life that be remote from levin she be gaze beyond he at the glow of the sunrise at the very instant when this apparition be vanish the truthful eye glance at he she recognize he and her face light up with wonder delight he could not be mistake there be no other eye like those in the world there be only one creature in the world that could concentrate for he all the brightness and meaning of life it be she it be kitty he understand that she be drive to ergushovo from the railway station and everything that have be stir levin during that sleepless night all the resolution he have make all vanish at once he recall with horror his dream of marry a peasant girl there only in the carriage that have cross over to the other side of the road and be rapidly disappear there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life which have weigh so agonizingly upon he of late she do not look out again the sound of the carriagespring be no long audible the bell could scarcely be hear the barking of dog show the carriage have reach the village and all that be leave be the empty field all round the village in front and he himself isolated and apart from it all wander lonely along the deserted highroad he glance at the sky expect to find there the cloud shell he have be admire and take as the symbol of the idea and feeling of that night there be nothing in the sky in the least like a shell there in the remote height above a mysterious change have be accomplish there be no trace of shell and there be stretch over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tiny cloudlet the sky have grow blue and bright and with the same softness but with the same remoteness it meet his question gaze  no  he say to himself  however good that life of simplicity and toil may be i can not go back to it i love she  none but those who be most intimate with alexey alexandrovitch know that while on the surface the cold and most reasonable of man he have one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character alexey alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman cry without be move the sight of tear throw he into a state of nervous agitation and he utterly lose all power of reflection the chief secretary of his department and his private secretary be aware of this and use to warn woman who come with petition on no account to give way to tear if they do not want to ruin their chance  he will get angry and will not listen to you  they use to say and as a fact in such case the emotional disturbance set up in alexey alexandrovitch by the sight of tear find expression in hasty anger  i can do nothing kindly leave the room  he would commonly cry in such case when return from the race anna have inform he of her relation with vronsky and immediately afterwards have burst into tear hide her face in her hand alexey alexandrovitch for all the fury arouse in he against she be aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produce in he by tear conscious of it and conscious that any expression of his feeling at that minute would be out of keeping with the position he try to suppress every manifestation of life in himself and so neither stir nor look at she this be what have cause that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which have so impress anna when they reach the house he help she to get out of the carriage and make an effort to master himself take leave of she with his usual urbanity and utter that phrase that bind he to nothing he say that tomorrow he would let she know his decision his wife ’s word confirm his bad suspicion have send a cruel pang to the heart of alexey alexandrovitch that pang be intensify by the strange feeling of physical pity for she set up by her tear but when he be all alone in the carriage alexey alexandrovitch to his surprise and delight feel complete relief both from this pity and from the doubt and agony of jealousy he experience the sensation of a man who have have a tooth out after suffer long from toothache after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge big than the head itself be tear out of his jaw the sufferer hardly able to believe in his own good luck feel all at once that what have so long poison his existence and enchain his attention exist no long and that he can live and think again and take interest in other thing besides his tooth this feeling alexey alexandrovitch be experience the agony have be strange and terrible but now it be over he feel that he could live again and think of something other than his wife  no honor no heart no religion a corrupt woman i always know it and always see it though i try to deceive myself to spare she  he say to himself and it actually seem to he that he always have see it he recall incident of their past life in which he have never see anything wrong before — now these incident prove clearly that she have always be a corrupt woman  i make a mistake in link my life to hers but there be nothing wrong in my mistake and so i can not be unhappy it ’ not i that be to blame  he tell himself  but she but i have nothing to do with she she do not exist for i  everythe relate to she and her son towards whom his sentiment be as much change as towards she cease to interest he the only thing that interest he now be the question of in what way he could well with most propriety and comfort for himself and thus with most justice extricate himself from the mud with which she have spatter he in her fall and then proceed along his path of active honorable and useful existence  i can not be make unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman have commit a crime i have only to find the good way out of the difficult position in which she have place i and i shall find it  he say to himself frown more and more  i ’m not the first nor the last  and to say nothing of historical instance date from the  fair helen  of menelaus recently revive in the memory of all a whole list of contemporary example of husband with unfaithful wife in the high society rise before alexey alexandrovitch ’s imagination  daryalov poltavsky prince karibanov count paskudin dram yes even dram such an honest capable fellow   semyonov tchagin sigonin  alexey alexandrovitch remember  admit that a certain quite irrational ridicule fall to the lot of these man yet i never see anything but a misfortune in it and always feel sympathy for it  alexey alexandrovitch say to himself though indeed this be not the fact and he have never feel sympathy for misfortune of that kind but the more frequently he have hear of instance of unfaithful wife betray their husband the more highly he have think of himself  it be a misfortune which may befall anyone and this misfortune have befall i the only thing to be do be to make the good of the position  and he begin pass in review the method of proceeding of man who have be in the same position that he be in  daryalov fight a duel  the duel have particularly fascinate the thought of alexey alexandrovitch in his youth just because he be physically a coward and be himself well aware of the fact alexey alexandrovitch could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aim at himself and have never make use of any weapon in his life this horror have in his youth set he ponder on duel and picture himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger have attain success and an establish position in the world he have long ago forget this feeling but the habitual bent of feeling reassert itself and dread of his own cowardice prove even now so strong that alexey alexandrovitch spend a long while think over the question of dueling in all its aspect and hug the idea of a duel though he be fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstance fight one  there ’ no doubt our society be still so barbarous it ’ not the same in england that very many”—and among these be those whose opinion alexey alexandrovitch particularly valued—“look favorably on the duel but what result be attain by it suppose i call he out  alexey alexandrovitch go on to himself and vividly picture the night he would spend after the challenge and the pistol aim at he he shudder and know that he never would do it—“suppose i call he out suppose i be teach  he go on muse  to shoot i press the trigger  he say to himself close his eye  and it turn out i have kill he  alexey alexandrovitch say to himself and he shake his head as though to dispel such silly idea  what sense be there in murder a man in order to define one ’s relation to a guilty wife and son i should still just as much have to decide what i ought to do with she but what be more probable and what would doubtless occur — i should be kill or wound i the innocent person should be the victim — kill or wound it ’ even more senseless but apart from that a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side do not i know perfectly well that my friend would never allow i to fight a duel — would never allow the life of a statesman need by russia to be expose to danger know perfectly well beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my simply try to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge that would be dishonest that would be false that would be deceive myself and other a duel be quite irrational and no one expect it of i my aim be simply to safeguard my reputation which be essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duty  official duty which have always be of great consequence in alexey alexandrovitch ’s eye seem of special importance to his mind at this moment consider and reject the duel alexey alexandrovitch turn to divorce — another solution select by several of the husband he remember pass in mental review all the instance he know of divorce there be plenty of they in the very high society with which he be very familiar alexey alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce be that which he have in view in all these instance the husband have practically cede or sell his unfaithful wife and the very party which be in fault have not the right to contract a fresh marriage have form counterfeit pseudomatrimonial tie with a selfstyled husband in his own case alexey alexandrovitch see that a legal divorce that be to say one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiate be impossible of attainment he see that the complex condition of the life they lead make the coarse proof of his wife ’s guilt require by the law out of the question he see that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proof be bring forward even if he have they and that to bring forward such proof would damage he in the public estimation more than it would she an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal which would be a perfect godsend to his enemy for calumny and attack on his high position in society his chief object to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible would not be attain by divorce either moreover in the event of divorce or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce it be obvious that the wife break off all relation with the husband and throw in her lot with the lover and in spite of the complete as he suppose contempt and indifference he now feel for his wife at the bottom of his heart alexey alexandrovitch still have one feeling leave in regard to she — a disinclination to see she free to throw in her lot with vronsky so that her crime would be to her advantage the mere notion of this so exasperate alexey alexandrovitch that directly it rise to his mind he groan with inward agony and get up and change his place in the carriage and for a long while after he sit with scowling brow wrap his numbed and bony leg in the fleecy rug  apart from formal divorce one might still do like karibanov paskudin and that good fellow dram — that is separate from one ’s wife  he go on think when he have regain his composure but this step too present the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce and what be more a separation quite as much as a regular divorce fling his wife into the arm of vronsky  no it ’ out of the question out of the question  he say again twist his rug about he again  i can not be unhappy but neither she nor he ought to be happy  the feeling of jealousy which have torture he during the period of uncertainty have pass away at the instant when the tooth have be with agony extract by his wife ’s word but that feeling have be replace by another the desire not merely that she should not be triumphant but that she should get due punishment for her crime he do not acknowledge this feeling but at the bottom of his heart he long for she to suffer for have destroy his peace of mind — his honor and go once again over the condition inseparable from a duel a divorce a separation and once again reject they alexey alexandrovitch feel convinced that there be only one solution — to keep she with he conceal what have happen from the world and use every measure in his power to break off the intrigue and still more — though this he do not admit to himself — to punish she  i must inform she of my conclusion that think over the terrible position in which she have place her you all other solution will be bad for both side than an external status quo and that such i agree to retain on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wish that be to say cessation of all intercourse with her lover  when this decision have be finally adopt another weighty consideration occur to alexey alexandrovitch in support of it  by such a course only shall i be act in accordance with the dictate of religion  he tell himself  in adopt this course i be not cast off a guilty wife but give she a chance of amendment and indeed difficult as the task will be to i i shall devote part of my energy to her reformation and salvation  though alexey alexandrovitch be perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity though in pass through these difficult moment he have not once think of seek guidance in religion yet now when his conclusion correspond as it seem to he with the requirement of religion this religious sanction to his decision give he complete satisfaction and to some extent restore his peace of mind he be pleased to think that even in such an important crisis in life no one would be able to say that he have not act in accordance with the principle of that religion whose banner

the painter the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lift cover with ring after look at the portrait for a minute alexey alexandrovitch shudder so that his lip quiver and he utter the sound  brrr  and turn away he make haste to sit down in his easy chair and open the book he try to read but he could not revive the very vivid interest he have feel before in egyptian hieroglyphic he look at the book and think of something else he think not of his wife but of a complication that have arise in his official life which at the time constitute the chief interest of it he feel that he have penetrate more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair and that he have originate a leading idea — he could say it without selfflattery — calculate to clear up the whole business to strengthen he in his official career to discomfit his enemy and thereby to be of the great benefit to the government directly the servant have set the tea and leave the room alexey alexandrovitch get up and go to the writingtable move into the middle of the table a portfolio of paper with a scarcely perceptible smile of selfsatisfaction he take a pencil from a rack and plunge into the perusal of a complex report relate to the present complication the complication be of this nature alexey alexandrovitch ’s characteristic quality as a politician that special individual qualification that every rise functionary possess the qualification that with his unflagging ambition his reserve his honesty and with his selfconfidence have make his career be his contempt for red tape his cutting down of correspondence his direct contact wherever possible with the live fact and his economy it happen that the famous commission of the 2nd of june have set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of land in the zaraisky province which fall under alexey alexandrovitch ’s department and be a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reform alexey alexandrovitch be aware of the truth of this the irrigation of these land in the zaraisky province have be initiate by the predecessor of alexey alexandrovitch ’s predecessor and vast sum of money have actually be spend and be still be spend on this business and utterly unproductively and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever alexey alexandrovitch have perceive this at once on enter office and would have like to lay hand on the board of irrigation but at first when he do not yet feel secure in his position he know it would affect too many interest and would be injudicious later on he have be engross in other question and have simply forget the board of irrigation it go of itself like all such board by the mere force of inertia many people gain their livelihood by the board of irrigation especially one highly conscientious and musical you all the daughter play on stringed instrument and alexey alexandrovitch know the family and have stand godfather to one of the eld daughter the raising of this question by a hostile department be in alexey alexandrovitch ’s opinion a dishonorable proceed see that in every department there be thing similar and bad which no one inquire into for wellknown reason of official etiquette however now that the glove have be throw down to he he have boldly pick it up and demand the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the board of irrigation of the land in the zaraisky province but in compensation he give no quarter to the enemy either he demand the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the native tribes organization committee the question of the native tribe have be bring up incidentally in the commission of the 2nd of june and have be press forward actively by alexey alexandrovitch as one admit of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribe in the commission this question have be a ground of contention between several department the department hostile to alexey alexandrovitch prove that the condition of the native tribe be exceedingly flourish that the propose reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity and that if there be anything wrong it arise mainly from the failure on the part of alexey alexandrovitch ’s department to carry out the measure prescribe by law now alexey alexandrovitch intend to demand first that a new commission should be form which should be empower to investigate the condition of the native tribe on the spot secondly if it should appear that the condition of the native tribe actually be such as it appear to be from the official document in the hand of the committee that another new scientific commission should be appoint to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribe from the—1 political 2 administrative 3 economic 4 ethnographical 5 material and 6 religious point of view thirdly that evidence should be require from the rival department of the measure that have be take during the last ten year by that department for avert the disastrous condition in which the native tribe be now place and fourthly and finally that that department explain why it have as appear from the evidence before the committee from no 17015 and 18038 from december 5 1863 and june 7 1864 act in direct contravention of the intent of the law t act 18 and the note to act 36 a flash of eagerness suffuse the face of alexey alexandrovitch as he rapidly write out a synopsis of these idea for his own benefit have fill a sheet of paper he get up rang and send a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain necessary fact for he get up and walk about the room he glance again at the portrait frown and smile contemptuously after read a little more of the book on egyptian hieroglyphic and renew his interest in it alexey alexandrovitch go to bed at eleven o’clock and recollect as he lie in bed the incident with his wife he see it now in by no mean such a gloomy light though anna have obstinately and with exasperation contradict vronsky when he tell she their position be impossible at the bottom of her heart she regard her own position as false and dishonorable and she long with her whole soul to change it on the way home from the race she have tell her husband the truth in a moment of excitement and in spite of the agony she have suffer in do so she be glad of it after her husband have leave she she tell herself that she be glad that now everything be make clear and at least there would be no more lying and deception it seem to she beyond doubt that her position be now make clear forever it might be bad this new position but it would be clear there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it the pain she have cause herself and her husband in utter those word would be reward now by everything be make clear she think that evening she see vronsky but she do not tell he of what have pass between she and her husband though to make the position definite it be necessary to tell he when she wake up next morning the first thing that rise to her mind be what she have say to her husband and those word seem to she so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have bring herself to utter those strange coarse word and could not imagine what would come of it but the word be speak and alexey alexandrovitch have go away without say anything  i see vronsky and do not tell he at the very instant he be go away i would have turn he back and tell he but i change my mind because it be strange that i have not tell he the first minute why be it i want to tell he and do not tell he  and in answer to this question a burn blush of shame spread over her face she know what have keep she from it she know that she have be ashamed her position which have seem to she simplify the night before suddenly strike she now as not only not simple but as absolutely hopeless she feel terrified at the disgrace of which she have not ever think before directly she think of what her husband would do the most terrible idea come to her mind she have a vision of be turn out of the house of her shame be proclaim to all the world she ask herself where she should go when she be turn out of the house and she could not find an answer when she think of vronsky it seem to she that he do not love she that he be already begin to be tired of she that she could not offer herself to he and she feel bitter against he for it it seem to she that the word that she have speak to her husband and have continually repeat in her imagination she have say to everyone and everyone have hear they she could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face she could not bring herself to call her maid and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess the maid who have be listen at her door for a long while come into her room of her own accord anna glance inquiringly into her face and blush with a scared look the maid beg her pardon for come in say

hand hang listlessly and every now and then she shiver all over seem as though she would make some gesture utter some word and sink back into lifelessness again she repeat continually  my god my god  but neither  god  nor  my  have any meaning to she the idea of seek help in her difficulty in religion be as remote from she as seek help from alexey alexandrovitch himself although she have never have doubt of the faith in which she have be bring up she know that the support of religion be possible only upon condition of renounce what make up for she the whole meaning of life she be not simply miserable she begin to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition never experience before in which she find herself she feel as though everything be begin to be double in her soul just as object sometimes appear double to overtired eye she hardly know at time what it be she fear and what she hope for whether she fear or desire what have happen or what be go to happen and exactly what she long for she could not have say  ah what be i do  she say to herself feel a sudden thrill of pain in both side of her head when she come to herself she see that she be hold her hair in both hand each side of her temple and pull it she jump up and begin walk about  the coffee be ready and mademoiselle and seryozha be wait  say annushka come back again and find anna in the same position  seryozha what

partly sincere though greatly exaggerated rôle of the mother live for her child which she have take up of late year and she feel with joy that in the plight in which she find herself she have a support quite apart from her relation to her husband or to vronsky this support be her son in whatever position she might be place she could not lose her son her husband might put she to shame and turn she out vronsky might grow cold to she and go on live his own life apart she think of he again with bitterness and reproach she could not leave her son she have an aim in life and she must act act to secure this relation to her son so that he might not be take from she quickly indeed as quickly as possible she must take action before he be take from she she must take her son and go away here be the one thing she have to do now she need consolation she must be calm and get out of this insufferable position the thought of immediate action bind she to her son of go away somewhere with

he ever join his father in punish i be it possible he will not feel for i  tear be already flow down her face and to hide they she get up abruptly and almost run out on to the terrace after the thunder shower of the last few day cold bright weather have set in the air be cold in the bright sun that filter through the freshly wash leave she shiver both from the cold and from the inward horror which have clutch she with fresh force in the open air  run along run along to mariette  she say to seryozha who have follow she out and she begin walk up and down on the straw matting of the terrace  can it be that they will not forgive i will not understand how it all could not be help  she say to herself stand still and look at the top of the aspen tree wave in the wind with their freshly wash brightly shine leave in the cold sunshine she know that they would not forgive she that everyone and everything would be merciless to she now as be that sky that green and again she feel that

any long in your house i be go away and take my son with i i do not know the law and so i do not know with which of the parent the son should remain but i take he with i because i can not live without he be generous leave he to i  up to this point she write rapidly and naturally but the appeal to his generosity a quality she do not recognize in he and the necessity of wind up the letter with something touching pull she up  of my fault and my remorse i can not speak because  she stop again find no connection in her idea  no  she say to herself  there ’ no need of anything  and tear up the letter she write it again leave out the allusion to generosity and seal it up another letter have to be write to vronsky  i have tell my husband  she write and she sit a long while unable to write more it be so coarse so unfeminine  and what more be i to write to he  she say to herself again a flush of shame spread over her face she recall his composure and a feeling of anger against he impel she to tear the sheet with the phrase she have write into tiny bit  no need of anything  she say to herself and close her blottingcase she go upstairs tell the governess and the servant that she be go that day to moscow and at once set to work to pack up her thing all the room of the summer villa be full of porter gardener and footman go to and fro carry out thing cupboard and chest be open twice they have send to the shop for cord piece of newspaper be toss about on the floor two trunk some bag and strappedup rug have be carry down into the hall the carriage and two hire cab be wait at the step anna forget her inward agitation in the work of packing be stand at a table in her boudoir pack her traveling bag when annushka call her attention to the rattle of some carriage drive up anna look out of the window and see alexey alexandrovitch ’s courier on the step ring at the front door bell  run and find out what it be  she say and with a calm sense of be prepare for anything she sit down in a low chair fold her hand on her knee a footman bring in a thick packet direct in alexey alexandrovitch ’s hand  the courier have order to wait for an answer  he say  very well  she say and as soon as he have leave the room she tear open the letter with tremble finger a roll of unfolded note do up in a wrapper fall out of it she disengage the letter and begin read it at the end  preparation shall be make for your arrival here   i attach particular significance to compliance  she read she run on then back read it all through and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning when she have finish she feel that she be cold all over and that a fearful calamity such as she have not expect have burst upon she in the morning she have regret that she have speak to her husband and wish for nothing so much as that those word could be unspoken and here this letter regard they as unspoken and give she what she have want but now this letter seem to she more awful than anything she have be able to conceive  he ’ right  she say  of course he ’ always right he ’ a christian he ’ generous yes vile base creature and no one understand it except i and no one ever will and i can not explain it they say he ’ so religious so highprincipled so upright so clever but they do not see what i ’ve see they do not know how he have crush my life for eight year crush everything that be live in i — he have not once even think that i ’m a live woman who must have love they do not know how at every step he ’ humiliate i and be just as pleased with himself have not i strive strive with all my strength to find something to give meaning to my life have not i struggle to love he to love my son when i could not love my husband but the time come when i know that i could not cheat myself any long that i be alive that i be not to blame that god have make i so that i must love and live and now what do he do if he ’d kill i if he ’d kill he i could have bear anything i could have forgive anything but no he how be it i do not guess what he would do he ’ do just what ’ characteristic of his mean character he ’ll keep himself in the right while i in my ruin he ’ll drive still low to bad ruin yet  she recall the word from the letter  you can conjecture what await you and your son   that ’ a threat to take away my child and most likely by their stupid law he can but i know very well why he say it he do not believe even in my love for my child or he despise it just as he always use to ridicule it he despise that feeling in i but he know that i will not abandon my child that i can not abandon my child that there could be no life for i without my child even with he whom i love but that if i abandon my child and run away from he i should be act like the most infamous base of woman he know that and know that i be incapable of do that  she recall another sentence in the letter  our life must go on as it have do in the past   that life be miserable enough in the old day it have be awful of late what will it be now and he know all that he know that i can not repent that i breathe that i love he know that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit but he want to go on torture i i know he i know that he ’ at home and be happy in deceit like a fish swim in the water no i will not give he that happiness i ’ll break through the spiderweb of lie in which he want to catch i come what may anything ’ well than lying and deceit   but how my god my god be ever a woman so miserable as i be   no i will break through it i will break through it  she cry jump up and keep back her tear and she go to the writingtable to write he another letter but at the bottom of her heart she feel that she be not strong enough to break through anything that she be not strong enough to get out of her old position however false and dishonorable it might be she sit down at the writingtable but instead of write she clasp her hand on the table and lay her head on they burst into tear with sob and heave breast like a child cry she be weep that her dream of her position be make clear and definite have be annihilate forever she know beforehand that everything would go on in the old way and far worse indeed than in the old way she feel that the position in the world that she enjoy and that have seem to she of so little consequence in the morning that this position be precious to she that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who have abandon husband and child to join her lover that however much she might struggle she could not be strong than herself she would never know freedom in love but would remain forever a guilty wife with the menace of detection hang over she at every instant deceive her husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man live apart and away from she whose life she could never share she know that this be how it would be and at the same time it be so awful that she could not even conceive what it would end in and she cry without restraint as child cry when they be punish the sound of the footman ’s step force she to rouse herself and hide her face from he she pretend to be write  the courier ask if there ’ an answer  the footman announce  an answer yes  say anna  let he wait i ’ll ring   what can i write  she think  what can i decide upon alone what do i know what do i want what be there i care for  again she feel that her soul be begin to be split in two she be terrify again at this feeling and clutch at the first pretext for do something which might divert her thought from herself  i ought to see alexey  so she call vronsky in her thought  no one but he can tell i what i ought to do i ’ll go to betsy ’s perhaps i shall see he there  she say to herself completely forget that when she have tell he the day before that she be not go to princess tverskaya ’s he have say that in that case he should not go either she go up to the table write to her husband  i have receive your letter — a  and ring the bell give it to the footman  we be not go  she say to annushka as she come in  not go at all   no do not unpack till tomorrow and let the carriage wait i ’m go to the princess ’s   which dress be i to get ready  the croquet party to which the princess tverskaya have invite anna be to consist of two lady and their adorer these two lady be the chief representative of a select new petersburg circle nickname in imitation of some imitation les sept merveilles du monde these lady belong to a circle which though of the high society be utterly hostile to that in which anna move moreover stremov one of the most influential people in petersburg and the elderly admirer of liza merkalova be alexey alexandrovitch ’s enemy in the political world from all these consideration anna have not mean to go and the hint in princess tverskaya ’s note refer to her refusal but now anna be eager to go in the hope of see vronsky anna arrive at princess tverskaya ’s early than the other guest at the same moment as she enter vronsky ’s footman with sidewhisker comb out like a kammerjunker go in too he stop at the door and take off his cap let she pass anna recognize he and only then recall that vronsky have tell she the day before that he would not come most likely he be send a note to say so as she take off her outer garment in the hall she hear the footman pronounce his  r ’  even like a kammerjunker say  from the count for the princess  and hand the note she long to question he as to where his master be she long to turn back and send he a letter to come and see she or to go herself to see he but neither the first nor the second nor the third course be possible already she hear bell ring to announce her arrival ahead of she and princess tverskaya ’s footman be stand at the open door wait for she to go forward into the inner room  the princess be in the garden they will inform she immediately would you be pleased to walk into the garden  announce another footman in another room the position of uncertainty of indecision be still the same as at home — bad in fact since it be impossible to take any step impossible to see vronsky and she have to remain here among outsider in company so uncongenial to her present mood but she be wear a dress that she know suit she she be not alone all around be that luxurious setting of idleness that she be used to and she feel less wretched than at home she be not force to think what she be to do everything would be do of itself on meet betsy come towards she in a white gown that strike she by its elegance anna smile at she just as she always do princess tverskaya be walk with tushkevitch and a young lady a relation who to the great joy of her parent in the province be spend the summer with the fashionable princess there be probably something unusual about anna for betsy notice it at once  i sleep badly  answer anna look intently at the footman who come to meet they and as she suppose bring vronsky ’s note  how glad i be you ’ve come  say betsy  i ’m tired and be just long to have some tea before they come you might go”—she turn to tushkevitch—“with masha and try the croquet ground over there where they ’ve be cut it we shall have time to talk a little over tea we ’ll have a cozy chat eh  she say in english to anna with a smile press the hand with which she hold a parasol  yes especially as i can not stay very long with you i ’m force to go on to old madame vrede i ’ve be promise to go for a century  say anna to whom lie alien as it be to her nature have become not merely simple and natural in society but a positive source of satisfaction why she say this which she have not think of a second before she could not have explain she have say it simply from the reflection that as vronsky would not be here she have well secure her own freedom and try to see he somehow but why she have speak of old madame vrede whom she have to go and see as she have to see many other people she could not have explain and yet as it afterwards turn out have she contrive the most cunning device to meet vronsky she could have think of nothing well  no i ’m not go to let you go for anything  answer betsy look intently into anna ’s face  really if i be not fond of you i should feel offended one would think you be afraid my society would compromise you tea in the little diningroom please  she say half close her eye as she always do when address the footman take the note from he she read it  alexey ’ play we false  she say in french  he write that he can not come  she add in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that vronsky could mean anything more to anna than a game of croquet anna know that betsy know everything but hear how she speak of vronsky before she she almost feel persuade for a minute that she know nothing  ah  say anna indifferently as though not greatly interested in the matter and she go on smile  how can you or your friend compromise anyone  this playing with word this hiding of a secret have a great fascination for anna as indeed it have for all woman and it be not the necessity of concealment not the aim with which the concealment be contrive but the process of concealment itself which attract her  i can not be more catholic than the pope  she say  stremov and liza merkalova why they ’re the cream of the cream of society besides they ’re receive everywhere and i”—she lay special stress on the i—“have never be strict and intolerant it ’ simply that i have not the time   no you do not care perhaps to meet stremov let he and alexey alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee — that ’ no affair of ours but in the world he ’ the most amiable man i know and a devoted croquet player you shall see and in spite of his absurd position as liza ’s lovesick swain at his age you ought to see how he carry off the absurd position he ’ very nice sappho shtoltz you do not know oh that ’ a new type quite new  betsy say all this and at the same time from her goodhumored shrewd glance anna feel that she partly guess her plight and be hatch something for her benefit they be in the little boudoir  i must write to alexey though  and betsy sit down to the table scribble a few line and put the note in an envelope  i ’m tell he to come to dinner i ’ve one lady extra to dinner with i and no man to take she in look what i ’ve say will that persuade he excuse i i must leave you for a minute would you seal it up please and send it off  she say from the door  i have to give some direction  without

it up and betsy come back in her presence hand the note to be take at tea which be bring they on a little teatable in the cool little drawingroom the cozy chat promise by princess tverskaya before the arrival of her visitor really do come off between the two woman they criticize the people they be expect and the conversation fall upon liza merkalova  she ’ very sweet and i always like she  say anna  you ought to like she she rave about you yesterday she come up to i after the race and be in despair at not find you she say you ’re a real heroine of romance and that if she be a man she would do all sort of mad thing for your sake stremov say she do that as it be   but do tell i please i never could make it out  say anna after be silent for some time speak in a tone that show she be not ask an idle question but that what she be ask be of more importance to she than it should have be  do tell i please what be her relation with prince kaluzhsky mishka as he ’ call i ’ve meet they so little what do it mean  betsy smile with her eye and look intently at anna  it ’ a new manner  she say  they ’ve all adopt that manner they ’ve fling their cap over the windmill but there be way and way of

her head be equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust of which so much be expose in front the impulsive abruptness of her movement be such that at every step the line of her knee and the upper part of her leg be distinctly mark under her dress and the question involuntarily rise to the mind where in the undulate piledup mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman so small and slender so naked in front and so hide behind and below really come to an end betsy make haste to introduce she to anna  only fancy we all but run over two soldier  she begin tell they at once use her

appreciate the fact be in perfect harmony with her style of beauty liza be as soft and enervated as sappho be smart and abrupt but to anna ’s taste liza be far more attractive betsy have say to anna that she have adopt the pose of an innocent child but when anna see she she feel that this be not the truth she really be both innocent and corrupt but a sweet and passive woman it be true that her tone be the same as sappho ’s that like sappho she have two man one young and one old tack onto she and devour she with their eye but there be something in she high than what surround she there be in she the glow of the real diamond among glass imitation this glow shine out in her exquisite truly enigmatic eye the weary and at the same time passionate glance of those eye encircle by dark ring

he be alexey alexandrovitch ’s enemy in the government he try like a shrewd man and a man of the world to be particularly cordial with she the wife of his enemy   nothing   he put in with a subtle smile  that ’ the very good way i tell you long ago  he say turn to liza merkalova  that if you do not want to be bored you must not think you ’re go to be bored it ’ just as you must not be afraid of

to anybody and i can not and will not knowingly make a pretense about it   you ’re incorrigible  say stremov not look at she and he speak again to anna as he rarely meet anna he could say nothing but commonplace to she but he say those commonplace as to when she be return to petersburg and how fond countess lidia ivanovna be of she with an expression which suggest that he long with his whole soul to please she and show his regard for she and even more than that tushkevitch come in announce that the party be await the other player to begin croquet  no do not go away please do not  plead liza merkalova hear that anna be go stremov join in her entreaty  it ’ too violent a transition  he say  to go from such company to old madame vrede and besides you will only give she a chance for talk scandal while here you arouse none but such different feeling of the high and most opposite kind  he say to she anna ponder for an instant in uncertainty this shrewd man ’s flattering word the naïve childlike affection show she by liza merkalova and all the social atmosphere she be use to — it be all so easy and what be in store for she be so difficult that she be for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain whether to put off a little long the painful moment of explanation but remember what be in store for she alone at home if she do not come to some decision remember that gesture — terrible even in memory — when she have clutch her hair in both hand — she say goodbye and go away in spite of vronsky ’s apparently frivolous life in society he be a man who hate irregularity in early youth in the corps of page he have experience the humiliation of a refusal when he have try be in difficulty to borrow money and since then he have never once put himself in the same position again in order to keep his affair in some sort of order he use about five time a year more or less frequently accord to circumstance to shut himself up alone and put all his affair into definite shape this he use to call his day of reckoning or faire la lessive on wake up the day after the race vronsky put on a white linen coat and without shave or take his bath he distribute about the table money bill and letter and set to work petritsky who know he be illtempered on such occasion on wake up and see his comrade at the writingtable quietly dress and go out without get in his way every man who know to the minute detail all the complexity of the condition surround he can not help imagine that the complexity of these condition and the difficulty of make they clear be something exceptional and personal peculiar to himself and never suppose that other be surround by just as complicated an array of personal affair as he be so indeed it seem to vronsky and not without inward pride and not without reason he think that any other man would long ago have be in difficulty would have be force to some dishonorable course if he have find himself in such a difficult position but vronsky feel that now especially it be essential for he to clear up and define his position if he be to avoid get into difficulty what vronsky attack first as be the easy be his pecuniary position write out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owe he add up the amount and find that his debt amount to seventeen thousand and some odd hundred which he leave out for the sake of clearness reckon up his money and his bank book he find that he have leave one thousand eight hundred rouble and nothing come in before the new year reckon over again his list of debt vronsky copy it divide it into three class in the first class he put the debt which he would have to pay at once or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not be a moment ’s delay in pay such debt amount to about four thousand one thousand five hundred for a horse and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade venovsky who have lose that sum to a cardsharper in vronsky ’s presence vronsky have want to pay the money at the time he have that amount then but venovsky and yashvin have insist that they would pay and not vronsky who have not play that be so far well but vronsky know that in this dirty business though his only share in it be undertake by word of mouth to be surety for venovsky it be absolutely necessary for he to have the two thousand five hundred rouble so as to be able to fling it at the swindler and have no more word with he and so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand rouble the second class — eight thousand rouble — consist of less important debt these be principally account owe in connection with his race horse to the purveyor of oats and hay the english saddler and so on he would have to pay some two thousand rouble on these debt too in order to be quite free from anxiety the last class of debt — to shop to hotel to his tailor — be such as need not be consider so that he need at least six thousand rouble for current expense and he only have one thousand eight hundred for a man with one hundred thousand rouble of revenue which be what everyone fix as vronsky ’s income such debt one would suppose could hardly be embarrassing but the fact be that he be far from have one hundred thousand his father ’s immense property which alone yield a yearly income of two hundred thousand be leave undivided between the brother at the time when the eld brother with a mass of debt marry princess varya tchirkova the daughter of a decembrist without any fortune whatever alexey have give up to his eld brother almost the whole income from his father ’s estate reserve for himself only twentyfive thousand a year from it alexey have say at the time to his brother that that sum would be sufficient for he until he marry which he probably never would do and his brother who be in command of one of the most expensive regiment and be only just married could not decline the gift his mother who have her own separate property have allow alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twentyfive thousand he have reserve and alexey have spend it all of late his mother incense with he on account of his love affair and his leave moscow have give up send he the money and in consequence of this vronsky who have be in the habit of live on the scale of fortyfive thousand a year have only receive twenty thousand that year find himself now in difficulty to get out of these difficulty he could not apply to his mother for money her last letter which he have receive the day before have particularly exasperate he by the hint in it that she be quite ready to help he to succeed in the world and in the army but not to lead a life which be a scandal to all good society his mother ’s attempt to buy he sting he to the quick and make he feel cold than ever to she but he could not draw back from the generous word when it be once utter even though he feel now vaguely foresee certain eventuality in his intrigue with madame karenina that this generous word have be speak thoughtlessly and that even though he be not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income but it be impossible to draw back he have only to recall his brother ’s wife to remember how that sweet delightful varya seek at every convenient opportunity to remind he that she remember his generosity and appreciate it to grasp the impossibility of take back his gift it be as impossible as beat a woman steal or lie one thing only could and ought to be do and vronsky determine upon it without an instant ’s hesitation to borrow money from a moneylender ten thousand rouble a proceeding which present no difficulty to cut down his expense generally and to sell his race horse resolve on this he promptly write a note to rolandak who have more than once send to he with offer to buy horse from he then he send for the englishman and the moneylender and divide what money he have accord to the account he intend to pay have finish this business he write a cold and cutting answer to his mother then he take out of his notebook three note of anna ’s read they again burn they and remember their conversation on the previous day he sink into meditation vronsky ’s life be particularly happy in that he have a code of principle which define with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do this code of principle cover only a very small circle of contingency but then the principle be never doubtful and vronsky as he never go outside that circle have never have a moment ’s hesitation about do what he ought to do these principle lay down as invariable rule that one must pay a cardsharper but need not pay a tailor that one must never tell a lie to a man but one may to a woman that one must never cheat anyone but one may a husband that one must never pardon an insult but one may give one and so on these principle be possibly not reasonable and not good but they be of unfailing certainty and so long as he adhere to they vronsky feel that his heart be at peace and he could hold his head up only quite lately in regard to his relation with anna vronsky have begin to feel that his code of principle do not fully cover all possible contingency and to foresee in the future difficulty and perplexity for which he could find no guide clue his present relation to anna and to her husband be to his mind clear and simple it be clearly and precisely define in the code of principle by which he be guide she be an honorable woman who have bestow her love upon he and he love she and therefore she be in his eye a woman who have a right to the same or even more respect than a lawful wife he would have have his hand chop off before he would have allow himself by a word by a hint to humiliate she or even to fall short of the full respect a woman could look for his attitude to society too be clear everyone might know might suspect it but no one might dare to speak of it if any do so he be ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the nonexistent honor of the woman he love his attitude to the husband be the clear of all from the moment that anna love vronsky he have regard his own right over she as the one thing unassailable her husband be simply a superfluous and tiresome person no doubt he be in a pitiable position but how could that be help the one thing the husband have a right to be to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand and vronsky be prepared for this at any minute but of late new inner relation have arise between he and she which frighten vronsky by their indefiniteness only the day before she have tell he that she be with child and he feel that this fact and what she expect of he call for something not fully define in that code of principle by which he have hitherto steer his course in life and he have be indeed catch unawares and at the first moment when she speak to he of her position his heart have prompt he to beg she to leave her husband he have say that but now think thing over he see clearly that it would be well to manage to avoid that and at the same time as he tell himself so he be afraid whether it be not wrong  if i tell she to leave her husband that must mean unite her life with mine be i prepared for that how can i take she away now when i have no money suppose i could arrange but how can i take she away while i ’m in the service if i say that — i ought to be prepared to do it that is i ought to have the money and to retire from the army  and he grow thoughtful the question whether to retire from the service or not bring he to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his life of which none know but he ambition be the old dream of his youth and childhood a dream which he do not confess even to himself though it be so strong that now this passion be even do battle with his love his first step in the world and in the service have be successful but two year before he have make a great mistake anxious to show his independence and to advance he have refuse a post that have be offer he hope that this refusal would heighten his value but it turn out that he have be too bold and he be pass over and have whether he like or not take up for himself the position of an independent man he carry it off with great tact and good sense behave as though he bear no grudge against anyone do not regard himself as injure in any way and care for nothing but to be leave alone since he be enjoy himself in reality he have cease to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before when he go away to moscow he feel that this independent attitude of a man who might have do anything but care to do nothing be already begin to pall that many people be begin to fancy that he be not really capable of anything but be a straightforward goodnatured fellow his connection with madame karenina by create so much sensation and attract general attention have give he a fresh distinction which soothe his gnaw worm of ambition for a while but a week before that worm have be rouse up again with fresh force the friend of his childhood a man of the same set of the same coterie his comrade in the corps of page serpuhovskoy who have leave school with he and have be his rival in class in gymnastic in their scrape and their dream of glory have come back a few day before from central asia where he have gain two step up in rank and an order rarely bestow upon general so young as soon as he arrive in petersburg people begin to talk about he as a newly rise star of the first magnitude a schoolfellow of vronsky ’s and of the same age he be a general and be expect a command which might have influence on the course of political event while vronsky independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman though he be be simply a cavalry captain who be readily allow to be as independent as ever he like  of course i do not envy serpuhovskoy and never could envy he but his advancement show i that one have only to watch one ’s opportunity and the career of a man like i may be very rapidly make three year ago he be in just the same position as i be if i retire i burn my ship if i remain in the army i lose nothing she say herself she do not wish to change her position and with her love i can not feel envious of serpuhovskoy  and slowly twirl his mustache he get up from the table and walk about the room his eye shine particularly brightly and he feel in that confident calm and happy frame of mind which always come after he have thoroughly face his position everything be straight and clear just as after former day of reckoning he shave take a cold bath dress and go out  we ’ve come to fetch you your lessive last a good time today  say petritsky  well be it over   it be over  answer vronsky smile with his eye only and twirl the tip of his mustache as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affair have be bring any overbold or rapid movement might disturb it  you ’re always just as if you ’d come out of a bath after it  say petritsky  i ’ve come from gritsky ’s  that be what they call the colonel  they ’re expect you  vronsky without answer look at his comrade think of something else  yes be that music at his place  he say listen to the familiar sound of polka and waltz float across to he  what ’ the fête   serpuhovskoy ’ come   aha  say vronsky  why i do not know  the smile in his eye gleam more brightly than ever have once make up his mind that he be happy in his love that he sacrifice his ambition to it — have anyway take up this position vronsky be incapable of feel either envious of serpuhovskoy or hurt with he for not come first to he when he come to the regiment serpuhovskoy be a good friend and he be delighted he have come  ah i ’m very glad  the colonel demin have take a large country house the whole party be in the wide low balcony in the courtyard the first object that meet vronsky ’s

quartermaster stand just before he still youngish looking though do his second term of service it be three year since vronsky have see serpuhovskoy he look more robust have let his whisker grow but be still the same graceful creature whose face and figure be even more strike from their softness and nobility than their beauty the only change vronsky detect in he be that subdued continual radiance of beam content which settle on the face of man who be successful and be sure of the recognition of their success by everyone vronsky know that radiant air and immediately observe it in serpuhovskoy as serpuhovskoy come down the step he see vronsky a smile of pleasure light up his face he toss his head upwards and wave the glass in his hand greet vronsky and show he by the gesture that he could not come to he before the quartermaster who stand crane forward his lip ready to be kiss  here he be  shout the colonel  yashvin tell i you be in one of your gloomy temper  serpuhovskoy kiss the moist fresh lip of the gallantlooking quartermaster and wipe his mouth with his handkerchief go up to vronsky  how glad i be  he say squeeze his hand and draw he on one side  you look after he  the colonel shout to yashvin point to vronsky and he go down below to the soldier  why be not you at the race yesterday i expect to see you there  say vronsky scrutinize serpuhovskoy  i do go but late i beg your pardon  he add and he turn to the adjutant  please have this divide from i each man as much as it run to  and he hurriedly take note for three hundred rouble from his pocketbook blush a little  vronsky have anything to eat or drink  ask yashvin  hi something for the count to eat ah here it be have a glass  the fête at the colonel ’s last a long while there be a great deal of drinking they toss serpuhovskoy in the air and catch he again several time then they do the same to the colonel then to the accompaniment of the band the colonel himself dance with petritsky then the colonel who begin to show sign of feebleness sit down on a bench in the courtyard and begin demonstrate to yashvin the superiority of russia over prussia especially in cavalry attack and there be a lull in the revelry for a moment serpuhovskoy go into the house to the bathroom to wash his hand and find vronsky there vronsky be drench his head with water he have take off his coat and put his sunburnt hairy neck under the tap and be rub it and his head with his hand when he have finish vronsky sit down by serpuhovskoy they both sit down in the bathroom on a lounge and a conversation begin which be very interesting to both of they  i ’ve always be hear about you through my wife  say serpuhovskoy  i ’m glad you ’ve be see she pretty often   she ’ friendly with varya and they ’re the only woman in petersburg i care about see  answer vronsky smile he smile because he foresee the topic the conversation would turn on and he be glad of it  the only one  serpuhovskoy query smile  yes and i hear news of you but not only through your wife  say vronsky check his hint by a stern expression of face  i be greatly delighted to hear of your success but not a bit surprised i expect even more  serpuhovskoy smile such an opinion of he be obviously agreeable to he and he do not think it necessary to conceal it  well i on the contrary expect less — i’ll own frankly but i ’m glad very glad i ’m ambitious that ’ my weakness and i confess to it   perhaps you would not confess to it if you have not be successful  say vronsky  i do not suppose so  say serpuhovskoy smile again  i will not say life would not be worth live without it but it would be dull of course i may be mistaken but i fancy i have a certain capacity for the line i ’ve choose and that power of any sort in my hand if it be to be will be well than in the hand of a good many people i know  say serpuhovskoy with beam consciousness of success  and so the near i get to it the well pleased i be   perhaps that be true for you but not for everyone i use to think so too but here i live and think life worth live not only for that   there it ’ out here it come  say serpuhovskoy laugh  ever since i hear about you about your refusal i begin of course i approve of what you do but there be way of do everything and i think your action be good in itself but you do not do it quite in the way you ought to have do   what ’ do can not be undo and you know i never go back on what i ’ve do and besides i ’m very well off   very well off — for the time but you ’re not satisfied with that i would not say this to your brother he ’ a nice child like our host here there he go  he add listen to the roar of  hurrah”—“and he ’ happy but that do not satisfy you   i do not say it do satisfy i   yes but that ’ not the only thing such man as you be want   by whom   by whom by society by russia russia need man she need a party or else everything go and will go to the dog   how do you mean bertenev ’s party against the russian communists   no  say serpuhovskoy frown with vexation at be suspect of such an absurdity  tout ça est une blague that ’ always be and always will be there be no communists but intriguing people have to invent a noxious dangerous party it ’ an old trick no what ’ want be a powerful party of independent man like you and i   but why so  vronsky mention a few man who be in power  why be not they independent man   simply because they have not or have not have from birth an independent fortune they ’ve not have a name they ’ve not be close to the sun and center as we have they can be buy either by money or by favor and they have to find a support for themselves in invent a policy and they bring forward some notion some policy that they do not believe in that do harm and the whole policy be really only a means to a government house and so much income cela n’est pas plus fin que ça when you get a peep at their card i may be inferior to they stupid perhaps though i do not see why i should be inferior to they but you and i have one important advantage over they for certain in be more difficult to buy and such man be more needed than ever  vronsky listen attentively but he be not so much interested by the meaning of the word as by the attitude of serpuhovskoy who be already contemplate a struggle with the exist power and already have his like and dislike in that high world while his own interest in the govern world do not go beyond the interest of his regiment vronsky feel too how powerful serpuhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for think thing out and for take thing in through his intelligence and gift of word so rarely meet with in the world in which he move and ashamed as he be of the feeling he feel envious  still i have not the one thing of most importance for that  he answer  i have not the desire for power i have it once but it ’ go   excuse i that ’ not true  say serpuhovskoy smile  yes it be true it be true   now  vronsky add to be truthful  yes it ’ true now that ’ another thing but that now will not last forever   perhaps  answer vronsky  you say perhaps  serpuhovskoy go on as though guess his thought  but i say for certain and that ’ what i want to see you for your action be just what it should have be i see that but you ought not to keep it up i only ask you to give i carte blanche i ’m not go to offer you my protection   though indeed why should not i protect you — you’ve protect i often enough i should hope our friendship rise above all that sort of thing yes  he say smile to he as tenderly as a woman  give i carte blanche retire from the regiment and i ’ll draw you upwards imperceptibly   but you must understand that i want nothing  say vronsky  except that all should be as it be  serpuhovskoy get up and stand face he  you say that all should be as it be i understand what that mean but listen we ’re the same age you ’ve know a great number of woman perhaps than i have  serpohovskoy ’s smile and gesture tell vronsky that he must not be afraid that he would be tender and careful in touch the sore place  but i ’m married and believe i in get to know thoroughly one ’s wife if one love she as someone have say one get to know all woman well than if one know thousand of they   we ’re come directly  vronsky shout to an officer who look into the room and call they to the colonel vronsky be long now to hear to the end and know what serpuhovskey would say to he  and here ’ my opinion for you woman be the chief stumbling block in a man ’s career it ’ hard to love a woman and do anything there ’ only one way of have love conveniently without its be a hindrance — that ’ marriage how how be i to tell you what i mean  say serpuhovskoy who like similes  wait a minute wait a minute yes just as you can only carry a fardeau and do something with your hand when the fardeau be tie on your back and that ’ marriage and that ’ what i feel when i be marry my hand be suddenly set free but to drag that fardeau about with you without marriage your hand will always be so full that you can do nothing look at mazankov at krupov they ’ve ruin their career for the sake of woman   what woman  say vronsky recall the frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two man he have mention be connect  the firm the woman ’s footing in society the bad it be that ’ much the same as — not merely carry the fardeau in your arm — but tear it away from someone else   you have never love  vronsky say softly look straight before he and think of anna  perhaps but you remember what i ’ve say to you and another thing woman be all more materialistic than man we make something immense out of love but they be always terreàterre   directly directly  he cry to a footman who come in but the footman have not come to call they again as he

then you give i carte blanche   we ’ll talk about it later on i ’ll look you up in petersburg  it be six o’clock already and so in order to be there quickly and at the same time not to drive with his own horse know to everyone vronsky get into yashvin ’s hire fly and tell the driver to drive as quickly as possible it be a roomy oldfashioned fly with seat for four he sit in one corner stretch his leg out on the front seat and sink into meditation a vague sense of the order into which his affair have be bring a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of serpuhovskoy who have consider he a man that be need and most of all the anticipation of the interview before he — all blend into a general joyous sense of life this feeling be so strong that he could not help smile he drop his leg cross one leg over the other knee and take it in his hand feel the springy muscle of the calf where it have be graze the day before by his fall and lean back he draw several deep breath  i ’m happy very happy  he say to himself he have often before have this sense of physical joy in his own body but he have never feel so fond of himself of his own body as at that moment he enjoy the slight ache in his strong leg he enjoy the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathe the bright cold august day which have make anna feel so hopeless seem to he keenly stimulating and refresh his face and neck that still tingle from the cold water the scent of brilliantine on his whisker strike he as particularly pleasant in the fresh air everything he see from the carriage window everything in that cold pure air in the pale light of the sunset be as fresh and gay and strong as he be himself the roof of the house shine in the ray of the set sun the sharp outline of fence and angle of building the figure of passersby the carriage that meet he now and then the motionless green of the tree and grass the field with evenly draw furrow of potato and the slant shadow that fall from the house and tree and bush and even from the row of potato — everything be bright like a pretty landscape just finish and freshly varnish  get on get on  he say to the driver put his head out of the window and pull a threerouble note out of his pocket he hand it to the man as he look round the driver ’s hand fumble with something at the lamp the whip crack and the carriage roll rapidly along the smooth highroad  i want nothing nothing but this happiness  he think stare at the bone button of the bell in the space between the window and picture to himself anna just as he have see she last time  and as i go on i love she more and more here ’ the garden of the vrede villa whereabouts will she be where how why do she fix on this place to meet i and why do she write in betsy ’s letter  he think wonder now for the first time at it but there be now no time for wonder he call to the driver to stop before reach the avenue and open the door jump out of the carriage as it be move and go into the avenue that lead up to the house there be no one in the avenue but look round to the right he catch sight of she her face be hide by a veil but he drink in with glad eye the special movement in walking peculiar to she alone the slope of the shoulder and the setting of the head and at once a sort of electric shock run all over he with fresh force he feel conscious of himself from the springy motion of his leg to the movement of his lung as he breathe and something set his lip twitch join he she press his hand tightly  you ’re not angry that i send for you i absolutely have to see you  she

courage then suddenly she stop  i do not tell you yesterday  she begin breathe quickly and painfully  that come home with alexey alexandrovitch i tell he everything   tell he i could not be his wife that   and tell he everything  he hear she unconsciously bend his whole figure down to she as though hope in this way to soften the hardness of her position for she but directly she have say this he suddenly draw himself up and a proud and hard expression come over his face  yes yes that ’ well a thousand time well i know how painful it be  he say but she be not listen to his word she be read his thought from the expression of his face she could not guess that that expression arise from the first idea that present itself to vronsky — that a duel be now inevitable the idea of a duel have never cross her mind and so she put a different interpretation on this pass expression of hardness when she get her husband ’s letter she know then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position to abandon her son and to join her lover the morning spend at princess tverskaya ’s have confirm she still more in this but this interview be still of the utmost gravity for she she hope that this interview would transform her position and save she if on hear this news he be to say to she resolutely passionately without an instant ’s waver  throw up everything and come with i  she would give up her son and go away with he but this news have not produce what she have expect in he he simply seem as though he be

take the letter but not read it and try to soothe she  the one thing i long for the one thing i pray for be to cut short this position so as to devote my life to your happiness   why do you tell i that  she say  do you suppose i can doubt it if i doubt   who ’ that come  say vronsky suddenly point to two lady walk towards they  perhaps they know we  and he hurriedly turn off draw she after he into a side path  oh i do not care  she say her lip be quiver and he fancy that her eye look with strange fury at he from under the veil  i tell you that ’ not the point — i can not doubt that but see what he write to i read it  she stand still again again just as at the first moment of hear of her rupture with her husband vronsky on read the letter be unconsciously carry away by the natural sensation arouse in he by his own relation to the betray husband now while he hold his letter in his hand he could not help picture the challenge which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow and the duel itself in which with the same cold and haughty expression that his face be assume at this moment he would await the injure husband ’s shot after have himself fire into the air and at that instant there flash across his mind the thought of what serpuhovskoy have just say to he and what he have himself be think in the morning — that it be well not to bind himself — and he know that this thought he could not tell she have read the letter he raise his eye to she and there be no determination in they she see at once that he have be think about it before by himself she know that whatever he might say to she he would not you all he think and she know that her last hope have fail she this be not what she have be reckon on  you see the sort of man he be  she say with a shake voice  he   forgive i but i rejoice at it  vronsky interrupt  for god ’s sake let i finish  he add his eye implore she to give he time to explain his word  i rejoice because thing can not can

assume an expression of indifference his speech would flow of itself well than he could prepare it now he feel that the import of his speech be of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight meantime as he listen to the usual report he have the most innocent and inoffensive air no one look at his white hand with their swollen vein and long finger so softly stroke the edge of the white paper that lie before he and at the air of weariness with which his head droop on one side would have suspect that in a few minute a torrent of word would flow from his lip that would arouse a

and sarcastic voice her aversion for he extinguish her pity for he and she feel only afraid but at all cost she want to make clear her position  i can not be your wife while i  she begin he laugh a cold and malignant laugh  the manner of life you have choose be reflect i suppose in your idea i have too much respect or contempt or both   i respect your past and despise your present   that i be far from the interpretation you put on my word  anna sigh and bow her head  though indeed i fail to comprehend how with the independence you show  he go on get hot  — announce your infidelity to your husband and see nothing reprehensible in it apparently — you can see anything reprehensible in perform a wife ’s duty in relation to your husband   alexey alexandrovitch what be it you want of i   i want you not to meet that man here and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servant can reproach you   not to see he that ’ not much i think and in return you will you all the privilege of a faithful wife without fulfil her duty that ’ all i have to say to you now it ’ time for i to go i ’m not dine at home  he get up and move towards the door anna get up too bow in silence he let she pass before he the night spend by levin on the haycock do not pass without result for he the way in which he have be manage his land revolt he and have lose all attraction for he in spite of the magnificent harvest never have there be or at least never it seem to he have there be so many hindrance and so many quarrel between he and the peasant as that year and the origin of these failure and this hostility be now perfectly comprehensible to he the delight he have experience in the work itself and the consequent great intimacy with the peasant the envy he feel of they of their life the desire to adopt that life which have be to he that night not a dream but an intention the execution of which he have think out in detail — all this have so transform his view of the farming of the land as he have manage it that he could not take his former interest in it and could not help see that unpleasant relation between he and the workpeople which be the foundation of it all the herd of improved cow such as pava the whole land plough over and enrich the nine level field surround with hedge the two hundred and forty acre heavily manure the seed sow in drill and all the rest of it — it be all splendid if only the work have be do for themselves or for themselves and comrade — people in sympathy with they but he see clearly now his work on a book of agriculture in which the chief element in husbandry be to have be the laborer greatly assist he in this that the sort of farming he be carry on be nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between he and the laborer in which there be on one side — his side — a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he consider well on the other side the natural order of thing and in this struggle he see that with immense expenditure of force on his side and with no effort or even intention on the other side all that be attain be that the work do not go to the liking of either side and that splendid tool splendid cattle and land be spoil with no good to anyone bad of all the energy expend on this work be not simply waste he could not help feel now since the meaning of this system have become clear to he that the aim of his energy be a most unworthy one in reality what be the struggle about he be struggle for every farthing of his share and he could not help it for he have only to relax his effort and he would not have have the money to pay his laborer  wage while they be only struggle to be able to do their work easily and agreeably that be to say as they be used to do it it be for his interest that every laborer should work as hard as possible and that while do so he should keep his wit about he so as to try not to break the winnowing machine the horse rake the thrash machine that he should attend to what he be do what the laborer want be to work as pleasantly as possible with rest and above all carelessly and heedlessly without think that summer levin see this at every step he send the man to mow some clover for hay pick out the bad patch where the clover be overgrown with grass and weed and of no use for seed again and again they mow the good acre of clover justify themselves by the pretense that the bailiff have tell they to and try to pacify he with the assurance that it would be splendid hay but he know that it be owe to those acre be so much easy to mow he send out a hay machine for pitch the hay — it be break at the first row because it be dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wing wave above he and he be tell  do not trouble your honor sure the womenfolk will pitch it quick enough  the plough be practically useless because it never occur to the laborer to raise the share when he turn the plough and force it round he strain the horse and tear up the ground and levin be beg not to mind about it the horse be allow to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be nightwatchman and in spite of order to the contrary the laborer insist on take turn for night duty and ivan after work all day long fall asleep and be very penitent for his fault say  do what you will to i your honor  they kill three of the good calf by let they into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking and nothing would make the man believe that they have be blow out by the clover but they tell he by way of consolation that one of his neighbor have lose a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three you all this happen not because anyone feel illwill to levin or his farm on the contrary he know that they like he think he a simple gentleman their high praise but it happen simply because all they want be to work merrily and carelessly and his interest be not only remote and incomprehensible to they but fatally opposed to their most just claim long before levin have feel dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land he see where his boat leak but he do not look for the leak perhaps purposely deceive himself nothing would be leave he if he lose faith in it but now he could deceive himself no long the farming of the land as he be manage it have become not merely unattractive but revolting to he and he could take no further interest in it to this now be join the presence only twentyfive mile off of kitty shtcherbatskaya whom he long to see and could not see darya alexandrovna oblonskaya have invite he when he be over there to come to come with the object of renew his offer to her sister who would so she give he to understand accept he now levin himself have feel on see kitty shtcherbatskaya that he have never cease to love she but he could not go over to the oblonskys  know she be there the fact that he have make she an offer and she have refuse he have place an insuperable barrier between she and he  i can not ask she to be my wife merely because she can not be the wife of the man she want to marry  he say to himself the thought of this make he cold and hostile to she  i should not be able to speak to she without a feeling of reproach i could not look at she without resentment and she will only hate i all the more as she ’ bind to and besides how can i now after what darya alexandrovna tell i go to see they can i help show that i know what she tell i and i to go magnanimously to forgive she and have pity on she i go through a performance before she of forgive and deign to bestow my love on she what induce darya alexandrovna to tell i that by chance i might have see she then everything would have happen of itself but as it be it ’ out of the question out of the question  darya alexandrovna send he a letter ask he for a sidesaddle for kitty ’s use  i ’m tell you have a sidesaddle  she write to he  i hope you will bring it over yourself  this be more than he could stand how could a woman of any intelligence of any delicacy put her sister in such a humiliating position he write ten note and tear they all up and send the saddle without any reply to write that he would go be impossible because he could not go to write that he could not come because something prevent he or that he would be away that be still bad he send the saddle without an answer and with a sense of have do something shameful he hand over all the now revolting business of the estate to the bailiff and set off next day to a remote district to see his friend sviazhsky who have splendid marsh for grouse in his neighborhood and have lately write to ask he to keep a longstanding promise to stay with he the grousemarsh in the surovsky district have long tempt levin but he have continually put off this visit on account of his work on the estate now he be glad to get away from the neighborhood of the shtcherbatskys and still more from his farm work especially on a shooting expedition which always in trouble serve as the good consolation in the surovsky district there be no railway nor service of post horse and levin drive there with his own horse in his big oldfashioned carriage he stop halfway at a welltodo peasant ’s to feed his horse a bald wellpreserved old man with a broad red beard gray on his cheek open the gate squeeze against the gatepost to let the three horse pass direct the coachman to a place under the shed in the big clean tidy yard with charred oldfashioned plough in it the old man ask levin to come into the parlor a cleanly dress young woman with clog on her bare foot be scrub the floor in the new outer room she be frightened of the dog that run in after levin and utter a shriek but begin laugh at her own fright at once when she be tell the dog would not hurt she point levin with her bare arm to the door into the parlor she bend down again hide her handsome face and go on scrub  would you like the samovar  she ask  yes please  the parlor be a big room with a dutch stove and a screen divide it into two under the holy picture stand a table paint in pattern a bench and two chair near the entrance be a dresser full of crockery the shutter be closed there be few fly and it be so clean that levin be anxious that laska who have be run along the road and bathe in puddle should not muddy the floor and order she to a place in the corner by the door after look round the parlor levin go out in the back yard the goodlooking young woman in clog swinge the empty pail on the yoke run on before he to the well for water  look sharp my girl  the old man shout after she goodhumoredly and he go up to levin  well sir be you go to nikolay ivanovitch sviazhsky his honor come to we too  he begin chat lean his elbow on the railing of the step in the middle of the old man ’s account of his acquaintance with sviazhsky the gate creak again and laborer come into the yard from the field with wooden plough and harrow the horse harness to the plough and harrow be sleek and fat the laborer be obviously of the household two be young man in cotton shirt and cap the two other be hire laborer in homespun shirt one an old man the other a young fellow move off from the step the old man go up to the horse and begin unharness they  what have they be plough  ask levin  plough up the potato we rent a bit of land too fedot do not let out the gelding but take it to the trough and we ’ll put the other in harness   oh father the ploughshare i order have he bring they along  ask the big healthylooking fellow obviously the old man ’s son  there   in the outer room  answer the old man bundle together the harness he have take off and fling it on the ground  you can put they on while they have dinner  the goodlooking young woman come into the outer room with the full pail drag at her shoulder more woman come on the scene from somewhere young and handsome middleaged old and ugly with child and without child the samovar be begin to sing the laborer and the family have dispose of the horse come in to dinner levin get his provision out of his carriage invite the old man to take tea with he  well i have have some today already  say the old man obviously accept the invitation with pleasure  but just a glass for company  over their tea levin hear all about the old man ’s farming ten year before the old man have rent three hundred acre from the lady who own they and a year ago he have buy they and rent another three hundred from a neighbor landowner a small part of the land — the bad part — he let out for rent while a hundred acre of arable land he cultivate himself with his family and two hire laborer the old man complain that thing be do badly but levin see that he simply do so from a feeling of propriety and that his farm be in a flourishing condition if it have be unsuccessful he would not have buy land at thirtyfive rouble the acre he would not have marry his three son and a nephew he would not have rebuild twice after fire and each time on a large scale in spite of the old man ’s complaint it be evident that he be proud and justly proud of his prosperity proud of his son his nephew his son  wife his horse and his cow and especially of the fact that he be keep all this farming go from his conversation with the old man levin think he be not averse to new method either he have plant a great many potato and his potato as levin have see drive past be already past flower and begin to die down while levin ’s be only just come into flower he earth up his potato with a modern plough borrow from a neighbor landowner he sow wheat the trifling fact that thin out his rye the old man use the rye he thin out for his horse specially strike levin how many time have levin see this splendid fodder waste and try to get it save but always it have turn out to be impossible the peasant get this do and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beast  what have the wench to do they carry it out in bundle to the roadside and the cart bring it away   well we landowner can not manage well with our laborer  say levin hand he a glass of tea  thank you  say the old man and he take the glass but refuse sugar point to a lump he have leave  they ’re simple destruction  say he  look at sviazhsky ’s for instance we know what the land ’ like — firstrate yet there ’ not much of a crop to boast of it ’ not look after enough — that ’ all it be   but you work your land with hire laborer   we ’re all peasant together we go into everything ourselves if a man ’ no use he can go and we can manage by ourselves   father finogen want some tar  say the young woman in the clog come in  yes yes that ’ how it be sir  say the old man get up and cross himself deliberately he thank levin and go out when levin go into the kitchen to call his coachman he see the whole family at dinner the woman be stand up wait on they the young sturdylooking son be tell something funny with his mouth full of pudding and they be all laugh the woman in the clog who be pour cabbage soup into a bowl laugh most merrily of all very probably the goodlooking face of the young woman in the clog have a good deal to do with the impression of wellbeing this peasant household make upon levin but the impression be so strong that levin could never get rid of it and all the way from the old peasant ’s to sviazhsky ’s he keep recall this peasant farm as though there be something in this impression that demand his special attention sviazhsky be the marshal of his district he be five year old than levin and have long be marry his sisterinlaw a young girl levin like very much live in his house and levin know that sviazhsky and his wife would have greatly like to marry the girl to he he know this with certainty as socalled eligible young man always know it though he could never have bring himself to speak of it to anyone and he know too that although he want to get marry and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife he could no more have marry she even if he have not be in love with kitty shtcherbatskaya than he could have fly up to the sky and this knowledge poison the pleasure he have hope to find in the visit to sviazhsky on get sviazhsky ’s letter with the invitation for shoot levin have immediately think of this but in spite of it he have make up his mind that sviazhsky ’s have such view for he be simply his own groundless supposition and so he would go all the same besides at the bottom of his heart he have a desire to try himself put himself to the test in regard to this girl the sviazhskys  homelife be exceedingly pleasant and sviazhsky himself the good type of man take part in local affair that levin know be very interesting to he sviazhsky be one of those people always a source of wonder to levin whose conviction very logical though never original go one way by themselves while their life exceedingly definite and firm in its direction go its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their conviction sviazhsky be an extremely advanced man he despise the nobility and believe the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom and only conceal their view from cowardice he regard russia as a ruined country rather after the style of turkey and the government of russia as so bad that he never permit himself to criticize its doing seriously and yet he be a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility and when he drive about he always wear the cockade of office and the cap with the red band he consider human life only tolerable abroad and go abroad to stay at every opportunity and at the same time he carry on a complex and improved system of agriculture in russia and with extreme interest follow everything and know everything that be be do in russia he consider the russian peasant as occupy a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man and at the same time in the local assembly no one be ready to shake hand with the peasant and listen to their opinion he believe neither in god nor the devil but be much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenue and take special trouble to keep up the church in his village on the woman question he be on the side of the extreme advocate of complete liberty for woman and especially their right to labor but he live with his wife on such term that their affectionate childless home life be the admiration of everyone and arrange his wife ’s life so that she do nothing and could do nothing but share her husband ’s effort that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible if it have not be a characteristic of levin ’s to put the most favorable interpretation on people sviazhsky ’s character would have present no doubt or difficulty to he he would have say to himself  a fool or a knave  and everything would have seem clear but he could not say  a fool  because sviazhsky be unmistakably clever and moreover a highly cultivate man who be exceptionally modest over his culture there be not a subject he know nothing of but he do not display his knowledge except when he be compel to do so still less could levin say that he be a knave as sviazhsky be unmistakably an honest goodhearted sensible man who work goodhumoredly keenly and perseveringly at his work he be hold in high honor by everyone about he and certainly he have never consciously do and be indeed incapable of do anything base levin try to understand he and could not understand he and look at he and his life as at a live enigma levin and he be very friendly and so levin use to venture to sound sviazhsky to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life but it be always in vain every time levin try to penetrate beyond the outer chamber of sviazhsky ’s mind which be hospitably open to all he notice that sviazhsky be slightly disconcerted faint sign of alarm be visible in his eye as though he be afraid levin would understand he and he would give he a kindly goodhumored repulse just now since his disenchantment with farming levin be particularly glad to stay with sviazhsky apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple so pleased with themselves and everyone else and their wellordered home have always a cheering effect on levin he feel a longing now that he be so dissatisfied with his own life to get at that secret in sviazhsky that give he such clearness definiteness and good courage in life moreover levin know that at sviazhsky ’s he should meet the landowner of the neighborhood and it be particularly interesting for he just now to hear and take part in those rural conversation concern crop laborer  wage and so on which he be aware be conventionally regard as something very low but which seem to he just now to constitute the one subject of importance  it be not perhaps of importance in the day of serfdom and it may not be of importance in england in both case the condition of agriculture be firmly establish but among we now when everything have be turn upside down and be only just take shape the question what form these condition will take be the one question of importance in russia  think levin the shooting turn out to be bad than levin have expect the marsh be dry and there be no grouse at all he walk about the whole day and only bring back three bird but to make up for that — he bring back as he always do from shoot an excellent appetite excellent spirit and that keen intellectual mood which with he always accompany violent physical exertion and while out shoot when he seem to be think of nothing at all suddenly the old man and his family keep come back to his mind and the impression of they seem to claim not merely his attention but the solution of some question connect with they in the evening at tea two landowner who have come about some business connect with a wardship be of the party and the interesting conversation levin have be look forward to spring up levin be sit beside his hostess at the tea table and be oblige to keep up a conversation with she and her sister who be sit opposite he madame sviazhskaya be a roundfaced fairhaired rather short woman all smile and dimple levin try through she to get a solution of the weighty enigma her husband present to his mind but he have not complete freedom of idea because he be in an agony of embarrassment this agony of embarrassment be due to the fact that the sisterinlaw be sit opposite to he in a dress specially put on as he fancy for his benefit cut particularly open in the shape of a trapeze on her white bosom this quadrangular opening in spite of the bosom ’s be very white or just because it be very white deprive levin of the full use of his faculty he imagine probably mistakenly that this lownecked bodice have be make on his account and feel that he have no right to look at it and try not to look at it but he feel that he be to blame for the very fact of the lownecked bodice have be make it seem to levin that he have deceive someone that he ought to explain something but that to explain it be impossible and for that reason he be continually blush be ill at ease and awkward his awkwardness infect the pretty sisterinlaw too but their hostess appear not to observe this and keep purposely draw she into the conversation  you say  she say pursue the subject that have be start  that my husband can not be interested in what ’ russian it ’ quite the contrary he be always in cheerful spirit abroad but not as he be here here he feel in his proper place he have so much to do and he have the faculty of interest himself in everything oh you ’ve not be to see our school have you   i ’ve see it the little house cover with ivy be not it   yes that ’ nastia ’s work  she say indicate her sister  you teach in it yourself  ask levin try to look above the open neck but feel that wherever he look in that direction he should see it  yes i use to teach in it myself and do teach still but we have a firstrate schoolmistress now and we ’ve start gymnastic exercise   no thank you i will not have any more tea  say levin and conscious of do a rude thing but incapable of continue the conversation he get up blush  i hear a very interesting conversation  he add and walk to the other end of the table where sviazhsky be sit with the two gentleman of the neighborhood sviazhsky be sit sideways with one elbow on the table and a cup in one hand while with the other hand he gather up his beard hold it to his nose and let it drop again as though he be smell it his brilliant black eye be look straight at the excited country gentleman with gray whisker and apparently he derive amusement from his remark the gentleman be complain of the peasant it be evident to levin that sviazhsky know an answer to this gentleman ’s complaint which would at once demolish his whole contention but that in his position he could not give utterance to this answer and listen not without pleasure to the landowner ’s comic speech the gentleman with the gray whisker be obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist who have live all his life in the country levin see proof of this in his dress in the oldfashioned threadbare coat obviously not his everyday attire in his shrewd deepset eye in his idiomatic fluent russian in the imperious tone that have become habitual from long use and in the resolute gesture of his large red sunburnt hand with an old betrothal ring on the little finger  if i ’d only the heart to throw up what ’ be set go   such a lot of trouble waste   i ’d turn my back on the whole business sell up go off like nikolay ivanovitch   to hear la belle hélène  say the landowner a pleasant smile light up his shrewd old face  but you see you do not throw it up  say nikolay ivanovitch sviazhsky  so there must be something gain   the only gain be that i live in my own house neither buy nor hire besides one keep hope the people will learn sense though instead of that you ’d never believe it — the drunkenness the immorality they keep chop and change their bit of land not a sight of a horse or a cow the peasant ’ die of hunger but just go and take he on as a laborer he ’ll do his good to do you a mischief and then bring you up before the justice of the peace   but then you make complaint to the justice too  say sviazhsky  i lodge complaint not for anything in the world such a talking and such a todo that one would have cause to regret it at the work for instance they pocket the advancemoney and make off what do the justice do why acquit they nothing keep they in order but their own communal court and their village elder he ’ll flog they in the good old style but for that there ’d be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away  obviously the landowner be chaff sviazhsky who far from resent it be apparently amuse by it  but you see we manage our land without such extreme measure  say he smile  levin and i and this gentleman  he indicate the other landowner  yes the thing ’ do at mihail petrovitch ’s but ask he how it ’ do do you call that a rational system  say the landowner obviously rather proud of the word  rational   my system ’ very simple  say mihail petrovitch  thank god all my management rest on get the money ready for the autumn taxis and the peasant come to i  father master help we  well the peasant be all one ’s neighbor one feel for they so one advance they a third but one say  remember lad i have help you and you must help i when i need it — whether it ’ the sowing of the oats or the haycutting or the harvest  and well one agree so much for each taxpayer — though there be dishonest one among they too it ’ true  levin who have long be familiar with these patriarchal method exchange glance with sviazhsky and interrupt mihail petrovitch turn again to the gentleman with the gray whisker  then what do you think  he ask  what system be one to adopt nowadays   why manage like mihail petrovitch or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasant that one can do — only that ’ just how the general prosperity of the country be be ruin where the land with serflabor and good management give a yield of nine to one on the halfcrop system it yield three to one russia have be ruin by the emancipation  sviazhsky look with smile eye at levin and even make a faint gesture of irony to he but levin do not think the landowner ’s word absurd he understand they well than he do sviazhsky a great deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whisker say to show in what way russia be ruin by the emancipation strike he indeed as very true new to he and quite incontestable the landowner unmistakably speak his own individual thought — a thing that very rarely happen — and a thought to which he have be bring not by a desire of find some exercise for an idle brain but a thought which have grow up out of the condition of his life which he have brood over in the solitude of his village and have consider in every aspect  the point be do not you see that progress of every sort be only make by the use of authority  he say evidently wish to show he be not without culture  take the reform of peter of catherine of alexander take european history and progress in agriculture more than anything else — the potato for instance that be introduce among we by force the wooden plough too be not always use it be introduce maybe in the day before the empire but it be probably bring in by force now in our own day we landowner in the serf time use various improvement in our husbandry drying machine and thrash machine and cart manure and all the modern implement — all that we bring into use by our authority and the peasant oppose it at first and end by imitate we now by the abolition of serfdom we have be deprive of our authority and so our husbandry where it have be raise to a high level be bind to sink to the most savage primitive condition that ’ how i see it   but why so if it ’ rational you ’ll be able to keep up the same system with hire labor  say sviazhsky  we ’ve no power over they with whom be i go to work the system allow i to ask   there it be — the labor force — the chief element in agriculture  think levin  with laborer   the laborer will not work well and will not work with good implement our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig and when he ’ drunk he ruin everything you give he he make the horse ill with too much water cut good harness barter the tire of the wheel for drink drop bit of iron into the thrash machine so as to break it he loathe the sight of anything that ’ not after his fashion and that ’ how it be the whole level of husbandry have fall land go out of cultivation overgrown with weed or divide among the peasant and where million of bushel be raise you get a hundred thousand the wealth of the country have decrease if the same thing have be do but with care that  and he proceed to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by mean of which these drawback might have be avoid this do not interest levin but when he have finish levin go back to his first position and address sviazhsky and try to draw he into express his serious opinion —  that the standard of culture be fall and that with our present relation to the peasant there be no possibility of farm on a rational system to yield a profit — that ’ perfectly true  say he  i do not believe it  sviazhsky reply quite seriously  all i see be that we do not know how to cultivate the land and that our system of agriculture in the serf day be by no means too high but too low we have no machine no good stock no efficient supervision we do not even know how to keep account ask any landowner he will not be able to tell you what crop ’ profitable and what ’ not   italian bookkeeping  say the gentleman of the gray whisker ironically  you may keep your book as you like but if they spoil everything for you there will not be any profit   why do they spoil thing a poor thrash machine or your russian presser they will break but my steam press they do not break a wretched russian nag they ’ll ruin but keep good drayhorse — they will not ruin they and so it be all round we must raise our farming to a high level   oh if one only have the mean to do it nikolay ivanovitch it ’ all very well for you but for i with a son to keep at the university lad to be educate at the high school — how be i go to buy these drayhorse   well that ’ what the land bank be for   to get what ’ leave i sell by auction no thank you   i do not agree that it ’ necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher  say levin  i devote myself to it and i have mean but i can do nothing as to the bank i do not know to whom they ’re any good for my part anyway whatever i ’ve spend money on in the way of husbandry it have be a loss stock — a loss machinery — a loss   that ’ true enough  the gentleman with the gray whisker chime in positively laugh with satisfaction  and i ’m not the only one  pursue levin  i mix with all the neighbor landowner who be cultivate their land on a rational system you all with rare exception be do so at a loss come tell we how do your land do — do it pay  say levin and at once in sviazhsky ’s eye he detect that fleeting expression of alarm which he have notice whenever he have try to penetrate beyond the outer chamber of sviazhsky ’s mind moreover this question on levin ’s part be not quite in good faith madame sviazhskaya have just tell he at tea that they have that summer invite a german expert in bookkeeping from moscow who for a consideration of five hundred rouble have investigate the management of their property and find that it be cost they a loss of three thousand odd rouble she do not remember the precise sum but it appear that the german have work it out to the fraction of a farthing the graywhiskered landowner smile at the mention of the profit of sviazhsky ’s famle obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal be likely to be make  possibly it do not pay  answer sviazhsky  that merely prove either that i ’m a bad manager or that i ’ve sink my capital for the increase of my rent   oh rent  levin cry with horror  rent there may be in europe where land have be improve by the labor put into it but with we all the land be deteriorate from the labor put into it — in other word they ’re work it out so there ’ no question of rent   how no rent it ’ a law   then we ’re outside the law rent explain nothing for we but simply muddle we no tell i how there can be a theory of rent   will you have some junket masha pass we some junket or raspberry  he turn to his wife  extraordinarily late the raspberry be last this year  and in the happy frame of mind sviazhsky get up and walk off apparently suppose the conversation to have end at the very point when to levin it seem that it be only just begin have lose his antagonist levin continue the conversation with the graywhiskered landowner try to prove to he that all the difficulty arise from the fact that we do not find out the peculiarity and habit of our laborer but the landowner like all man who think independently and in isolation be slow in take in any other person ’s idea and particularly partial to his own he stick to it that the russian peasant be a swine and like swinishness and that to get he out of his swinishness one must have authority and there be none one must have the stick and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replace the stick that serve we for a thousand year by lawyer and model prison where the worthless stinking peasant be feed on good soup and have a fix allowance of cubic foot of air  what make you think  say levin try to get back to the question  that it ’ impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive   that never could be so with the russian peasantry we ’ve no power over they  answer the landowner  how can new condition be find  say sviazhsky have eat some junket and light a cigarette he come back to the discussion  all possible relation to the labor force have be define and study  he say  the relic of barbarism the primitive commune with each guarantee for all will disappear of itself serfdom have be abolish — there remain nothing but free labor and its form be fixed and ready make and must be adopt permanent hand daylaborer rammer — you can not get out of those form   but europe be dissatisfied with these form   dissatisfied and seek new one and will find they in all probability   that ’ just what i be mean  answer levin  why should not we seek they for ourselves   because it would be just like invent afresh the mean for construct railway they be ready invent   but if they do not do for we if they ’re stupid  say levin and again he detect the expression of alarm in the eye of sviazhsky  oh yes we ’ll bury the world under our cap we ’ve find the secret europe be seek for i ’ve hear all that but excuse i do you know all that ’ be do in europe on the question of the organization of labor   no very little   that question be now absorb the good mind in europe the schulzedelitsch movement and then all this enormous literature of the labor question the most liberal lassalle movement   the mulhausen experiment that ’ a fact by now as you ’re probably aware   i have some idea of it but very vague   no you only say that no doubt you know all about it as well as i do i ’m not a professor of sociology of course but it interest i and really if it interest you you ought to study it   but what conclusion have they come to   excuse i  the two neighbor have rise and sviazhsky once more check levin in his inconvenient habit of peep into what be beyond the outer chamber of his mind go to see his guest out levin be insufferably bored that evening with the lady he be stir as he have never be before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he be feel with his system of manage his land be not an exceptional case but the general condition of thing in russia that the organization of some relation of the laborer to the soil in which they would work as with the peasant he have meet halfway to the sviazhskys  be not a dream but a problem which must be solve and it seem to he that the problem could be solve and that he ought to try and solve it after say goodnight to the lady and promise to stay the whole of the next day so as to make an expedition on horseback with they to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest levin go before go to bed into his host ’s study to get the book on the labor question that sviazhsky have offer he sviazhsky ’s study be a huge room surround by bookcase and with two table in it — one a massive writingtable stand in the middle of the room and the other a round table cover with recent number of review and journal in different language range like the ray of a star round the lamp on the writingtable be a stand of drawer mark with gold lettering and full of paper of various sort sviazhsky take out the book and sit down in a rockingchair  what be you look at there  he say to levin who be stand at the round table look through the review  oh yes there ’ a very interesting article here  say sviazhsky of the review levin be hold in his hand  it appear  he go on with eager interest  that friedrich be not after all the person chiefly responsible for the partition of poland it be prove  and with his characteristic clearness he sum up those new very important and interesting revelation although levin be engross at the moment by his idea about the problem of the land he wonder as he hear sviazhsky  what be there inside of he and why why be he interested in the partition of poland  when sviazhsky have finish levin could not help ask  well and what then  but there be nothing to follow it be simply interesting that it have be prove to be so and so but sviazhsky do not explain and see no need to explain why it be interesting to he  yes but i be very much interested by your irritable neighbor  say levin sigh  he ’ a clever fellow and say a lot that be true   oh get along with you an inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart like all of they  say sviazhsky  whose marshal you be   yes only i marshal they in the other direction  say sviazhsky laugh  i ’ll tell you what interest i very much  say levin  he ’ right that our system that ’ to say of rational farming do not answer that the only thing that answer be the moneylender system like that meeklooking gentleman ’s or else the very simple whose fault be it   our own of course besides it ’ not true that it do not answer it answer with vassiltchikov   a factory   but i really do not know what it be you be surprised at the people be at such a low stage of rational and moral development that it ’ obvious they ’re bind to oppose everything that ’ strange to they in europe a rational system answer because the people be educate it follow that we must educate the people — that ’ all   but how be we to educate the people   to educate the people three thing be need school and school and school   but you say yourself the people be at such a low stage of material development what help be school for that   do you know you remind i of the story of the advice give to the sick man — you should try purgative medicine take worse try leech try they worse well then there ’ nothing leave but to pray to god try it bad that ’ just how it be with we i say political economy you say — bad i say socialism bad education bad   but how do school help matter   they give the peasant fresh want   well that ’ a thing i ’ve never understand  levin reply with heat  in what way be school go to help the people to improve their material position you say school education will give they fresh want so much the bad since they will not be capable of satisfy they and in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism be go to improve their material condition i never could make out the day before yesterday i meet a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby and ask she where she be go she say she be go to the wise woman her boy have screaming fit so she be take he to be doctor i ask  why how do the wise woman cure screaming fit   she put the child on the henroost and repeat some charm    well you ’re say it yourself what ’ want to prevent she take her child to the henroost to cure it of screaming fit be just  sviazhsky say smile goodhumoredly  oh no  say levin with annoyance  that method of doctoring i merely mean as a simile for doctor the people with school the people be poor and ignorant — that we see as surely as the peasant woman see the baby be ill because it scream but in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance be to be cure by school be as incomprehensible as how the henroost affect the screaming what have to be cure be what make he poor   well in that at least you ’re in agreement with spencer whom you dislike so much he say too that education may be the consequence of great prosperity and comfort of more frequent washing as he say but not of be able to read and write   well then i ’m very glad — or the contrary very sorry that i ’m in agreement with spencer only i ’ve know it a long while school can do no good what will do good be an economic organization in which the people will become rich will have more leisure — and then there will be school   still all over europe now school be obligatory   and how far do you agree with spencer yourself about it  ask levin but there be a gleam of alarm in sviazhsky ’s eye and he say smile  no that screaming story be positively capital do you really hear it yourself  levin see that he be not to discover the connection between this man ’s life and his thought obviously he do not care in the least what his reasoning lead he to all he want be the process of reasoning and he do not like it when the process of reasoning bring he into a blind alley that be the only thing he dislike and avoid by change the conversation to something agreeable and amusing all the impression of the day begin with the impression make by the old peasant which serve as it be as the fundamental basis of all the conception and idea of the day throw levin into violent excitement this dear good sviazhsky keep a stock of idea simply for social purpose and obviously have some other principle hide from levin while with the crowd whose name be legion he guide public opinion by idea he do not share that irascible country gentleman perfectly correct in the conclusion that he have be worry into by life but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class and that the good class in russia his own dissatisfaction with the work he have be do and the vague hope of find a remedy for all this — all be blend in a sense of inward turmoil and anticipation of some solution near at hand leave alone in the room assign he lie on a spring mattress that yield unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg levin do not fall asleep for a long while not one conversation with sviazhsky though he have say a great deal that be clever have interest levin but the conclusion of the irascible landowner require consideration levin could not help recall every word he have say and in imagination amend his own reply  yes i ought to have say to he you say that our husbandry do not answer because the peasant hate improvement and that they must be force on he by authority if no system of husbandry answer at all without these improvement you would be quite right but the only system that do answer be where laborer be work in accordance with his habit just as on the old peasant ’s land halfway here your and our general dissatisfaction with the system show that either we be to blame or the laborer we have go our way — the european way — a long while without ask ourselves about the quality of our labor force let we try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force but as the russian peasant with his instinct and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that imagine i ought to have say to he that you have the same system as the old peasant have that you have find mean of make your laborer take an interest in the success of the work and have find the happy mean in the way of improvement which they will admit and you will without exhaust the soil get twice or three time the yield you get before divide it in half give half as the share of labor the surplus leave you will be great and the share of labor will be great too and to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborer in its success how to do this — that ’ a matter of detail but undoubtedly it can be do  this idea throw levin into a great excitement he do not sleep half the night think over in detail the putting of his idea into practice he have not intend to go away next day but he now determine to go home early in the morning besides the sisterinlaw with her lownecked bodice arouse in he a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action most important of all — he must get back without delay he would have to make haste to put his new project to the peasant before the sowing of the winter wheat so that the sowing might be undertake on a new basis he have make up his mind to revolutionize his whole system the carrying out of levin ’s plan present many difficulty but he struggle on do his utmost and attain a result which though not what he desire be enough to enable he without selfdeception to believe that the attempt be worth the trouble one of the chief difficulty be that the process of cultivate the land be in full swing that it be impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning and the machine have to be mend while in motion when on the evening that he arrive home he inform the bailiff of his plan the latter with visible pleasure agree with what he say so long as he be point out that all that have be do up to that time be stupid and useless the bailiff say that he have say so a long while ago but no heed have be pay he but as for the proposal make by levin — to take a part as shareholder with his laborer in each agricultural undertaking — at this the bailiff simply express a profound despondency and offer no definite opinion but begin immediately talk of the urgent necessity of carry the remain sheaf of rye the next day and of send the man out for the second ploughing so that levin feel that this be not the time for discuss it on begin to talk to the peasant about it and make a proposition to cede they the land on new term he come into collision with the same great difficulty that they be so much absorb by the current work of the day that they have not time to consider the advantage and disadvantage of the propose scheme the simplehearted ivan the cowherd seem completely to grasp levin ’s proposal — that he should with his family take a share of the profit of the cattleyard — and he be in complete sympathy with the plan but when levin hint at the future advantage ivan ’s face express alarm and regret that he could not hear all he have to say and he make haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay he either snatch up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pen or run to get water or to clear out the dung another difficulty lie in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a landowner ’s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of they they be firmly convince that his real aim whatever he might say to they would always be in what he do not say to they and they themselves in give their opinion say a great deal but never say what be their real object moreover levin feel that the irascible landowner have be right the peasant make their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be force to any new method of tillage of any kind nor to use new implement they agree that the modern plough plough well that the scarifier do the work more quickly but they find thousand of reason that make it out of the question for they to use either of they and though he have accept the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation he feel sorry to give up improved method the advantage of which be so obvious but in spite of all these difficulty he get his way and by autumn the system be work or at least so it seem to he at first levin have think of give up the whole farming of the land just as it be to the peasant the laborer and the bailiff on new condition of partnership but he be very soon convinced that this be impossible and determined to divide it up the cattleyard the garden hay field and arable land divide into several part have to be make into separate lot the simplehearted cowherd ivan who levin fancy understand the matter well than any of they collect together a gang of worker to help he principally of his own family become a partner in the cattleyard a distant part of the estate a tract of waste land that have lie fallow for eight year be with the help of the clever carpenter fyodor ryezunov take by six family of peasant on new condition of partnership and the peasant shuraev take the management of all the vegetable garden on the same term the remainder of the land be still work on the old system but these three associate partnership be the first step to a new organization of the whole and they completely take up levin ’s time it be true that in the cattleyard thing go no well than before and ivan strenuously oppose warm housing for the cow and butter make of fresh cream affirm that cow require less food if keep cold and that butter be more profitable make from sour cream and he ask for wage just as under the old system and take not the slight interest in the fact that the money he receive be not wage but an advance out of his future share in the profit it be true that fyodor ryezunov ’s company do not plough over the ground twice before sow as have be agree justify themselves on the plea that the time be too short it be true that the peasant of the same company though they have agree to work the land on new condition always speak of the land not as hold in partnership but as rent for half the crop and more than once the peasant and ryezunov himself say to levin  if you would take a rent for the land it would save you trouble and we should be more free  moreover the same peasant keep put off on various excuse the building of a cattleyard and barn on the land as agree upon and delay do it till the winter it be true that shuraev would have like to let out the kitchen garden he have undertake in small lot to the peasant he evidently quite misunderstand and apparently intentionally misunderstand the condition upon which the land have be give to he often too talk to the peasant and explain to they all the advantage of the plan levin feel that the peasant hear nothing but the sound of his voice and be firmly resolve whatever he might say not to let themselves be take in he feel this especially when he talk to the clever of the peasant ryezunov and detect the gleam in ryezunov ’s eye which show so plainly both ironical amusement at levin and the firm conviction that if anyone be to be take in it would not be he ryezunov but in spite of all this levin think the system work and that by keep account strictly and insist on his own way he would prove to they in the future the advantage of the arrangement and then the system would go of itself these matter together with the management of the land still leave on his hand and the indoor work over his book so engross levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever go out shoot at the end of august he hear that the oblonskys have go away to moscow from their servant who bring back the sidesaddle he feel that in not answer darya alexandrovna ’s letter he have by his rudeness of which he could not think without a flush of shame burn his ship and that he would never go and see they again he have be just as rude with the sviazhskys leave they without say goodbye but he would never go to see they again either he do not care about that now the business of reorganize the farming of his land absorb he as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life he read the book lend he by sviazhsky and copy out what he have not get he read both the economic and socialistic book on the subject but as he have anticipate find nothing bear on the scheme he have undertake in the book on political economy — in mill for instance whom he study first with great ardor hope every minute to find an answer to the question that be engross he — he find law deduce from the condition of land culture in europe but he do not see why these law which do not apply in russia must be general he see just the same thing in the socialistic book either they be the beautiful but impracticable fantasy which have fascinate he when he be a student or they be attempt at improve rectify the economic position in which europe be place with which the system of land tenure in russia have nothing in common political economy tell he that the law by which the wealth of europe have be develop and be develop be universal and unvarying socialism tell he that development along these line lead to ruin and neither of they give an answer or even a hint in reply to the question what he levin and all the russian peasant and landowner be to do with their million of hand and million of acre to make they as productive as possible for the common weal have once take the subject up he read conscientiously everything bear on it and intend in the autumn to go abroad to study land system on the spot in order that he might not on this question be confront with what so often meet he on various subject often just as he be begin to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he be talk to and be begin to explain his own he would suddenly be tell  but kauffmann but jones but dubois but michelli you have not read they they ’ve thrash that question out thoroughly  he see now distinctly that kauffmann and michelli have nothing to tell he he know what he want he see that russia have splendid land splendid laborer and that in certain case as at the peasant ’s on the way to sviazhsky ’s the produce raise by the laborer and the land be great — in the majority of case when capital be apply in the european way the produce be small and that this simply arise from the fact that the laborer want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way and that this antagonism be not incidental but invariable and have its root in the national spirit he think that the russian people whose task it be to colonize and cultivate vast tract of unoccupied land consciously adhere till all their land be occupy to the method suitable to their purpose and that their method be by no means so bad as be generally suppose and he want to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land at the end of september the timber have be cart for build the cattleyard on the land that have be allot to the association of peasant and the butter from the cow be sell and the profit divide in practice the system work capitally or at least so it seem to levin in order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book which in levin ’s daydream be not merely to effect a revolution in political economy but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil all that be leave to do be to make a tour abroad and to study on the spot all that have be do in the same direction and to collect conclusive evidence that all that have be do there be not what be want levin be only wait for the delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad but the rain begin prevent the harvesting of the corn and potato leave in the field and put a stop to all work even to the delivery of the wheat the mud be impassable along the road two mill be carry away and the weather get bad and bad on the 30th of september the sun come out in the morning and hope for fine weather levin begin make final preparation for his journey he give order for the wheat to be deliver send the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owe he and go out himself to give some final direction on the estate before set off have finish all his business soak through with the stream of water which keep run down the leather behind his neck and his gaiter but in the keen and most confident temper levin return homewards in the evening the weather have become bad than ever towards evening the hail lash the drench mare so cruelly that she go along sideways shake her head and ear but levin be all right under his hood and he look cheerfully about he at the muddy stream run under the wheel at the drop hang on every bare twig at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstone on the plank of the bridge at the thick layer of still juicy fleshy leave that lie heap up about the stripped elmtree in spite of the gloominess of nature around he he feel peculiarly eager the talk he have be have with the peasant in the further village have show that they be begin to get used to their new position the old servant to whose hut he have go to get dry evidently approve of levin ’s plan and of his own accord propose to enter the partnership by the purchase of cattle  i have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim and i shall attain my end  think levin  and it ’ something to work and take trouble for this be not a matter of myself individually the question of the public welfare come into it the whole system of culture the chief element in the condition of the people must be completely transform instead of poverty general prosperity and content instead of hostility harmony and unity of interest in short a bloodless revolution but a revolution of the great magnitude begin in the little circle of our district then the province then russia the whole world because a just idea can not but be fruitful yes it ’ an aim worth work for and its be i kostya levin who go to a ball in a black tie and be refuse by the shtcherbatskaya girl and who be intrinsically such a pitiful worthless creature — that prove nothing i feel sure franklin feel just as worthless and he too have no faith in himself think of himself as a whole that mean nothing and he too most likely have an agafea mihalovna to whom he confide his secret  muse on such thought levin reach home in the darkness the bailiff who have be to the merchant have come back and bring part of the money for the wheat an agreement have be make with the old servant and on the road the bailiff have learn that everywhere the corn be still stand in the field so that his one hundred and sixty shock that have not be carry be nothing in comparison with the loss of other after dinner levin be sit as he usually do in an easy chair with a book and as he read he go on think of the journey before he in connection with his book you all the significance of his book rise before he with special distinctness and whole period range themselves in his mind in illustration of his theory  i must write that down  he think  that ought to form a brief introduction which i think unnecessary before  he get up to go to his writingtable and laska lie at his foot get up too stretch and look at he as though to inquire where to go but he have not time to write it down for the head peasant have come round and levin go out into the hall to they after his levee that be to say give direction about the labor of the next day and see all the peasant who have business with he levin go back to his study and sit down to work laska lie under the table agafea mihalovna settle herself in her place with her stocking after write for a little while levin suddenly think with exceptional vividness of kitty her refusal and their last meeting he get up and begin walk about the room  what ’ the use of be dreary  say agafea mihalovna  come why do you stay on at home you ought to go to some warm spring especially now you ’re ready for the journey   well i be go away the day after tomorrow agafea mihalovna i must finish my work   there there your work you say as if you have not do enough for the peasant why as  ti they ’re say  your master will be get some honor from the tsar for it  indeed and it be a strange thing why need you worry about the peasant   i ’m not worry about they i ’m do it for my own good  agafea mihalovna know every detail of levin ’s plan for his land levin often put his view before she in all their complexity and not uncommonly he argue with she and do not agree with her comment but on this occasion she entirely misinterpret what he have say  of one ’s soul ’s salvation we all know and must think before all else  she say with a sigh  parfen denisitch now for all he be no scholar he die a death that god grant everyone of we the like  she say refer to a servant who have die recently  take the sacrament and all   that ’ not what i mean  say he  i mean that i ’m act for my own advantage it ’ all the well for i if the peasant do their work well   well whatever you do if he ’ a lazy goodfornought everything’ll be at six and seven if he have a conscience he ’ll work and if not there ’ no do anything   oh come you say yourself ivan have begin look after the cattle well   all i say be  answer agafea mihalovna evidently not speak at random but in strict sequence of idea  that you ought to get marry that ’ what i say    agafea mihalovna ’s allusion to the very subject he have only just be think about hurt and sting he levin scowl and without answer she he sit down again to his work repeat to himself all that he have be think of the real significance of that work only at interval he listen in the stillness to the click of agafea mihalovna ’s needle and recollect what he do not want to remember he frown again   at nine o’clock they hear the bell and the faint vibration of a carriage over the mud    well here ’s visitor come to we and you will not be dull  say agafea mihalovna get up and go to the door but levin overtake she his work be not go well now and he be glad of a visitor whoever it might be     run halfway down the staircase levin catch a sound he know a familiar cough in the hall but he hear it indistinctly through the sound of his own footstep and hope he be mistake then he catch sight of a long bony familiar figure and now it seem there be no possibility of mistake and yet he still go on hope that this tall man take off his fur cloak and cough be not his brother nikolay   levin love his brother but be with he be always a torture just now when levin under the influence of the thought that have come to he and agafea mihalovna ’s hint be in a troubled and uncertain humor the meeting with his brother that he have to face seem particularly difficult instead of a lively healthy visitor some outsider who would he hope cheer he up in his uncertain humor he have to see his brother who know he through and through who would call forth all the thought near his heart would force he to show himself fully and that he be not disposed to do   angry with himself for so base a feeling levin run into the hall as soon as he have see his brother close this feeling of selfish disappointment vanish instantly and be replace by pity terrible as his brother nikolay have be before in his emaciation and sickliness now he look still more emaciated still more wasted he be a skeleton cover with skin   he stand in the hall jerk his long thin neck and pull the scarf off it and smile a strange and pitiful smile when he see that smile submissive and humble levin feel something clutch at his throat    you see i ’ve come to you  say nikolay in a thick voice never for one second take his eye off his brother ’s face  i ’ve be mean to a long while but i ’ve be unwell all the time now i ’m ever so much well  he say rub his beard with his big thin hand    yes yes  answer levin and he feel still more frightened when kiss he he feel with his lip the dryness of his brother ’s skin and see close to he his big eye full of a strange light   a few week before konstantin levin have write to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property that have remain undivided there be a sum of about two thousand rouble to come to he as his share   nikolay say that he have come now to take this money and what be more important to stay a while in the old nest to get in touch with the earth so as to renew his strength like the hero of old for the work that lie before he in spite of his exaggerated stoop and the emaciation that be so striking from his height his movement be as rapid and abrupt as ever levin lead he into his study   his brother dress with particular care — a thing he never use to do — comb his scanty lank hair and smile go upstairs   he be in the most affectionate and goodhumored mood just as levin often remember he in childhood he even refer to sergey ivanovitch without rancor when he see agafea mihalovna he make joke with she and ask after the old servant the news of the death of parfen denisitch make a painful impression on he a look of fear cross his face but he regain his serenity immediately    of course he be quite old  he say and change the subject  well i ’ll spend a month or two with you and then i ’m off to moscow do you know myakov have promise i a place there and i ’m go into the service now i ’m go to arrange my life quite differently  he go on  you know i get rid of that woman     marya nikolaevna why what for     oh she be a horrid woman she cause i all sort of worry  but he do not say what the annoyance be he could not say that he have cast off marya nikolaevna because the tea be weak and above all because she would look after he as though he be an invalid    besides i want to turn over a new leaf completely now i ’ve do silly thing of course like everyone else but money ’ the last consideration i do not regret it so long as there ’ health and my health thank god be quite restore    levin listen and rack his brain but could think of nothing to say nikolay probably feel the same he begin question his brother about his affair and levin be glad to talk about himself because then he could speak without hypocrisy he tell his brother of his plan and his doing   his brother listen but evidently he be not interested by it   these two man be so akin so near each other that the slight gesture the tone of voice tell both more than could be say in word   both of they now have only one thought — the illness of nikolay and the nearness of his death — which stifle all else but neither of they dare to speak of it and so whatever they say — not utter the one thought that fill their mind — be all falsehood never have levin be so glad when the evening be over and it be time to go to bed never with any outside person never on any official visit have he be so unnatural and false as he be that evening and the consciousness of this unnaturalness and the remorse he feel at it make he even more unnatural he want to weep over his die dearly love brother and he have to listen and keep on talk of how he mean to live   as the house be damp and only one bedroom have be keep heated levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen   his brother get into bed and whether he sleep or do not sleep toss about like a sick man cough and when he could not get his throat clear mumble something sometimes when his breathing be painful he say  oh my god  sometimes when he be choke he mutter angrily  ah the devil  levin could not sleep for a long while hear he his thought be of the most various but the end of all his thought be the same — death death the inevitable end of all for the first time present itself to he with irresistible force and death which be here in this love brother groan half asleep and from habit calling without distinction on god and the devil be not so remote as it have hitherto seem to he it be in himself too he feel that if not today tomorrow if not tomorrow in thirty year be not it all the same and what be this inevitable death — he do not know have never think about it and what be more have not the power have not the courage to think about it    i work i want to do something but i have forget it must all end i have forget — death    he sit on his bed in the darkness crouch up hug his knee and hold his breath from the strain of thought he ponder but the more intensely he think the clear it become to he that it be indubitably so that in reality look upon life he have forget one little fact — that death will come and all end that nothing be even worth begin and that there be no help it anyway yes it be awful but it be so    but i be alive still now what ’ to be do what ’ to be do  he say in despair he light a candle get up cautiously and go to the lookingglass and begin look at his face and hair yes there be gray hair about his temple he open his mouth his back tooth be begin to decay he bare his muscular arm yes there be strength in they but nikolay who lie there breathe with what be leave of lung have have a strong healthy body too and suddenly he recall how they use to go to bed together as child and how they only wait till fyodor bogdanitch be out of the room to fling pillow at each other and laugh laugh irrepressibly so that even their awe of fyodor bogdanitch could not check the effervescing overbrimming sense of life and happiness  and now that bent hollow chest   and i not know what will become of i or wherefore     kha kha damnation why do you keep fidget why do not you go to sleep  his brother ’s voice call to he    oh i do not know i ’m not sleepy     i have have a good sleep i ’m not in a sweat now just see feel my shirt it ’ not wet be it    levin felt withdraw behind the screen and put out the candle but for a long while he could not sleep the question how to live have hardly begin to grow a little clear to he when a new insoluble question present itself — death    why he ’ die — yes he ’ll die in the spring and how help he what can i say to he what do i know about it i ’d even forget that it be at all      levin have long before make the observation that when one be uncomfortable with people from their be excessively amenable and meek one be apt very soon after to find thing intolerable from their touchiness and irritability he feel that this be how it would be with his brother and his brother nikolay ’s gentleness do in fact not last out for long the very next morning he begin to be irritable and seem do his good to find fault with his brother attack he on his tender point   levin feel himself to blame and could not set thing right he feel that if they have both not keep up appearance but have speak as it be call from the heart — that be to say have say only just what they be think and feel — they would simply have look into each other ’s face and konstantin could only have say  you ’re die you ’re die  and nikolay could only have answer  i know i ’m die but i ’m afraid i ’m afraid i ’m afraid  and they could have say nothing more if they have say only what be in their heart but life like that be impossible and so konstantin try to do what he have be try to do all his life and never could learn to do though as far as he could observe many people know so well how to do it and without it there be no living at all he try to say what he be not think but he feel continually that it have a ring of falsehood that his brother detect he in it and be exasperate at it   the third day nikolay induce his brother to explain his plan to he again and begin not merely attack it but intentionally confound it with communism    you ’ve simply borrow an idea that ’ not your own but you ’ve distort it and be try to apply it where it ’ not applicable     but i tell you it ’ nothing to do with it they deny the justice of property of capital of inheritance while i do not deny this chief stimulus  levin feel disgust himself at use such expression but ever since he have be engross by his work he have unconsciously come more and more frequently to use word not russian  all i want be to regulate labor     which mean you ’ve borrow an idea strip it of all that give it its force and want to make believe that it ’ something new  say nikolay angrily tug at his necktie    but my idea have nothing in common     that anyway  say nikolay levin with an ironical smile his eye flash malignantly  have the charm of — what ’ one to call it — geometrical symmetry of clearness of definiteness it may be a utopia but if once one allow the possibility of make of all the past a tabula rasa — no property no family — then labor would organize itself but you gain nothing     why do you mix thing up i ’ve never be a communist     but i have and i consider it ’ premature but rational and it have a future just like christianity in its first age     all that i maintain be that the labor force ought to be investigate from the point of view of natural science that be to say it ought to be study its quality ascertain     but that ’ utter waste of time that force find a certain form of activity of itself accord to the stage of its development there have be slave first everywhere then metayers and we have the halfcrop system rent and day laborer what be you try to find    levin suddenly lose his temper at these word because at the bottom of his heart he be afraid that it be true — true that he be try to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar form and that this be hardly possible    i be try to find mean of work productively for myself and for the laborer i want to organize  he answer hotly    you do not want to organize anything it ’ simply just as you ’ve be all your life that you want to be original to pose as not exploit the peasant simply but with some idea in view     oh all right that ’ what you think — and let i alone  answer levin feel the muscle of his left cheek twitch uncontrollably    you ’ve never have and never have conviction all you want be to please your vanity     oh very well then let i alone     and i will let you alone and it ’ high time i do and go to the devil with you and i ’m very sorry i ever come    in spite of all levin ’s effort to soothe his brother afterwards nikolay would listen to nothing he say declare that it be well to part and konstantin see that it simply be that life be unbearable to he   nikolay be just get ready to go when konstantin go in to he again and beg he rather unnaturally to forgive he if he have hurt his feeling in any way    ah generosity  say nikolay and he smile  if you want to be right i can give you that satisfaction you ’re in the right but i ’m go all the same    it be only just at parting that nikolay kiss he and say look with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother    anyway do not remember evil against i kostya  and his voice quiver these be the only word that have be speak sincerely between they levin know that those word mean  you see and you know that i ’m in a bad way and maybe we shall not see each other again  levin know this and the tear gush from his eye he kiss his brother once more but he could not speak and know not what to say   three day after his brother ’s departure levin too set off for his foreign tour happen to meet shtcherbatsky kitty ’s cousin in the railway train levin greatly astonish he by his depression    what ’ the matter with you  shtcherbatsky ask he    oh nothing there ’ not much happiness in life     not much you come with i to paris instead of to mulhausen you shall see how to be happy     no i ’ve do with it all it ’ time i be dead     well that ’ a good one  say shtcherbatsky laugh  why i ’m only just get ready to begin     yes i think the same not long ago but now i know i shall soon be dead    levin say what he have genuinely be think of late he see nothing but death or the advance towards death in everything but his cherish scheme only engross he the more life have to be get through somehow till death do come darkness have fall upon everything for he but just because of this darkness he feel that the one guide clue in the darkness be his work and he clutch it and cling to it with all his strength
